I have been ordering from Peking since forever and never had an issue with them. My bell had been broken for a while, but this is the first time that a delivery guy decided to make a complaint about me to Talabat for not answering the door although he didn't knock on the door while waiting and also didn't ring the intercom when entering the building. When he finally decided to knock I immediately opened and then he complained that I didn't open the door and that he tried to reach me, I apologized to him for the wait & told him that the bell was broken and asked why he didn't knock earlier and even compensated him with a generous tip for the inconvenience. Then I find out that he had already called Talabat and filed some sort of complaint?! 4 different people from Talabat called me, to tell me that the delivery guy is waiting for me - although he had already left 20mins ago, and basically to lecture me about making the delivery guy wait. Whole situation was just ridiculous unnecessary and rude."

It is absolutely ridiculous what this restaurant sees as normal portion for the prices they charge! Tiny portion sizes and the food came cold, soggy, and looking EXTREMELY unappetising after waiting 75 minutes for it to be delivered!!! When I complained, I had to go through the call center twice to finally speak to a manager who said that was their normal portion size. I told him I wanted a refund, and he offered to give me a refund AND replace the meal that night (since I informed him I was busy the next day and would not be home). He sent the driver to give me a refund and pick up the meal. I stayed up until 1am waiting AND NOTHING CAME TO REPLACE IT. The gall and audacity of this place is incredible!

Creamy potato soup, disaster, it had meat in it which was not mentioned in the menu. I called the restaurant to ask for what kind of meat is that, if it is halal or haram because it looks like pork ham. at first they said they don't know, then they asked us for the references of our order, they kept us for 10 minutes on the line while they checked the menu from their mobile (we could hear the sound of it), then they said that there is no meat on the soup. instead of asking the chef they only read the useless menu. we decided to stop wasting time, hang up and put the soup outside the house. Shrimp caesar salad. ok, but not worth the price. Vegetable spring rolls, good but the sweet chilli sauce was missing. Hot dynamit rolls. good, let's say. Guava juice and Mango juice was more expensive than some other shops that i found after. I will never order again from this shop InshAllah because of the experience and the price too. still I would like to know what that meat was inside the soup as i tasted it before noticing it. if you made me eat haram, you know what you deserve."
