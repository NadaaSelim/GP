Beyond Flavours,Ppck2412,20 May 2019,4,"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time."
Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,20 May 2019,3,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!"
Beyond Flavours,Anindya,19 May 2019,5,"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..

Beyond Flavours,Santhosh Reddyy,19 May 2019,5,My review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot's of place even though the food is good in places like these. Special hey to papiya shuvro!

Beyond Flavours,Pradeep Kumar Gupta,19 May 2019,5,Service experience was very good especially by Papiya. Food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well. I would like to visit Beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price.
Beyond Flavours,Shubham Singh Chauhan,19 May 2019,5,"Service , Food and Ambiance was very nice. Staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food. Live music was like cherry on the cake"
Beyond Flavours,Prerna Mund,19 May 2019,5,The food was ‚ù§Ô∏è.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.
Beyond Flavours,Pranith Patro,18 May 2019,5,Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.
Beyond Flavours,Sai Raj Kiran,18 May 2019,4,"I came here with my parents. We ordered for Thai peneer tikka, kaju pulao and veg biryani. The kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good. This is a decent place to go with family. Shubro and papiya served well."
Beyond Flavours,Razeen,18 May 2019,5,Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience
Beyond Flavours,Prasanna,18 May 2019,5,"Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service."
Beyond Flavours,Jeevith Reddy,18 May 2019,4,"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
Shoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon."
Beyond Flavours,Sugandha Saxena,18 May 2019,4,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"
Beyond Flavours,Singh.ibm,18 May 2019,5,Had lunch today at beyond flavors .The food was very Good and delicious and awesome service was provided by Soumen Das & Shuvro. Would highly recommend the restaurant .
Beyond Flavours,Sind Hu,18 May 2019,3,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.
Beyond Flavours,Sameer Singh,17 May 2019,4,"Service is really exceptional. Cheers to Manav, who served us really well. Food was nice too. Loved the ambience too, with nice music playing in the background."
Beyond Flavours,Jaya Phaneendra,17 May 2019,5,"Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!

Beyond Flavours,Gokulnath Kunjumon,17 May 2019,5,Papiya Shuvro was great. She helped us get the tables quickly and suggested us the best sizzlers in the menu. Ambience was awesome. She suggested the best table and was very helpful till we were there. Will visit again for the awesome service. You guys should try as well if u plan to take your loved one n give an osm experience then this is the place.

Beyond Flavours,Catherene Clement,16 May 2019,5,"This was the first time we visited this restaurant and the experience was good in terms of food, hospitality, service and ambience. Thanks to shubro and papiya for their hospitality"
Beyond Flavours,Dyagamrahul,16 May 2019,3,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."
Beyond Flavours,Malleshwari Seelam,15 May 2019,4,The place is just beyond beautiful. Ambience is excellent and food is good. The service by Soumen Das is extremely good. Highly recommended place.
Beyond Flavours,Vibhor Joshi,15 May 2019,5,"I have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.
I would specially recommend their soups, the healthy broth soup and the roasted chicken soup are amazing.
In addition the service is great and our server Papiya was very courteous and prompt. This place has become my go to place for a good dining experience."
Beyond Flavours,Vikas Raikwar,15 May 2019,4,If you have time to waste for taste u r most welcome ... the taste was really superb but the service was very very slow..! Dishes were impressively having different flavours which i liked..!
Beyond Flavours,Snigdha Jidigam,15 May 2019,5,The food here is good and would add on if you could increase your spread.Ananya was courteous and good at serving..!!Ambience was also good and was peaceful...........................!!!!!!!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

Food is really great...
Thanks Papiya for the service...üòä
Staff was reallly co-operative...
Ambience is really great, especially PDR(Private Dining Room) is awesome...üòçüëåüèª"
Beyond Flavours,Tejaswi Rao,15 May 2019,1,"we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,"
Beyond Flavours,Satyajit Sarangi,15 May 2019,5,"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."
Beyond Flavours,Gautam Dev,15 May 2019,5,"Second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. Very courteous staff and very hospitile.
Taste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .
Very impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up."
Beyond Flavours,Paridhi Mittal,15 May 2019,5,"We ordered Vegetable Lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka, both of which were absolutely delicious. The ambience is amazing and the service is good."
Beyond Flavours,Sathya K,14 May 2019,5,One of the best food experiences I had in hyderabad. The desserts was yum. Appricot pudding is must have. @Ahmed Khan your service was unparalled. Keep up the good work.
Beyond Flavours,Rashmi Prasad,14 May 2019,5,"Ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... He may suggest great food as he has good experience. The staters and sizzler was too good. The sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. Nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
Great experience in beyond flavors."
Beyond Flavours,Shopharsh29,14 May 2019,5,Had dinner at this place and the attendant was Papiya. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome. Good variety of food and beverages.
Beyond Flavours,Saswati Kar Choudhury,14 May 2019,3,"We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good .We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.The buffet spread was one of a kind:
Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!
Overall :3.2"
Beyond Flavours,Manish Reddy,14 May 2019,4,"Good Ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
I‚Äôve got best company here by ANANYA (Beyond Flavours)
The place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
Great place for friends."
Beyond Flavours,Mudit,12 May 2019,2,"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"
Beyond Flavours,Susmitha Penisetti,12 May 2019,3,"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."
Beyond Flavours,Tanmayee Manchiraju,11 May 2019,5,"It's one of the best places to hangout with friends. Seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc.
Food was very good and the ambience was also very nice.
Loved everything.‚ù§"
Beyond Flavours,Sunil.bollineni,11 May 2019,5,Ambience is good and staff are polite and friendly. Food is super good and had nice time having lunch .... keep up the good work. Thank you for your nice hospitality. Loved it üíï üíï üíï
Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,11 May 2019,1,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."
Beyond Flavours,Surya Sharma,10 May 2019,1,"Hostile staff, okeish food, not so great ambiance. Not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 4.1
Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place."
Beyond Flavours,Spandhana.hr,09 May 2019,5,"Thanks Ahmed Food is great will recommend to visit again and again. Service is excellent and ambience is good , we had a great time with my family"
Beyond Flavours,Manab Maji,09 May 2019,5,"This is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good ,beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of money.i am personally highly recommend this place.great flavour of food and very much prompt service.ambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant."
Beyond Flavours,Parshwa Shah,09 May 2019,2,Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.
Beyond Flavours,Sreshta Ladegaam,09 May 2019,1,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service."
Beyond Flavours,Kiron Kshetrapal,09 May 2019,5,This is the place I really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food lover.pasta and sizzlers are so yummy that I cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than other.service is the part were you really satisfied.
Beyond Flavours,Navneet Raj,08 May 2019,5,"I'm very much impressed by the quality of food and service. Specially Mr Ahmed, thank you for your politeness and readiness. About food i can only say that it is beyond flavours. Loved this place. Must visit, great ambience."
Beyond Flavours,Debapriya Chhotray,08 May 2019,5,The food was indeed beyond falvours. Ahmed served us well. Hoping to meet next time soon. A great ambience and amazing songs on the background added innumerous flavours to the delicious food.
Beyond Flavours,Mahesh Tambe,08 May 2019,5,Starters are very good and service is also good. Ahmed is very polite and helped us selecting menu.l which tuned out be great. Would like to come back again.
Beyond Flavours,Trupti Dhongdi,08 May 2019,1,"Had a very bad experience here
beyond flavours really puts you beyond all the flavours
had gone here for dinner and the next day had to get hospitalised because of food infection
I guess the food was not served fresh"
Beyond Flavours,SitaMilind,07 May 2019,4,Lovely ambience..Roasted chicken soup was the Highlight of our dinner..Basket biryani was full of flavours and yumm.lasagne was great.Nice to go with whole family.Appetisers quantity is less though.
Beyond Flavours,Lakshmi Prasanna,06 May 2019,2,I liked the food and ambience but the problem is with the staff.. they are not so responsive.. we‚Äôve ordered one item but we got something else.. otherwise place and the food are good..

We ordered :
Chilli chicken : 2.5/ 5
Paneer tikka : 3.5/5
Chicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible
Chicken biryani: 3/5
Garlic naan: 2/5

The staff were least bothered and kept us waiting for like 20 mins jus to take order and after all that the food was very disappointing. This is only a much hyped restaurant. I would not go and recommend this place to anyone for frequent dine experience."

Flechazo,Vivek Vuppala,24 May 2019,2,We were 4 people who visited this place on Thursday night....Ambience and service are good .Food is disappointed.Not worth for money we pay.
Flechazo,Jalaj Goyal,24 May 2019,4,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Section wise Ratings:

Ambience: 3.5/5
Staff: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Buffet items: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"

Flechazo,Fairina Siddiqui,17 May 2019,1,"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place."
Flechazo,Rahul Kolli,16 May 2019,5,"The starters were good . Especially mutton starter , They are many varieties in Chicken then other items .
The ambience is so good and the staff is great .
Jayanta service was very good and food was on time. Thanks to them ."
Flechazo,Sneha Battula,14 May 2019,5,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

This place is indeed a foodie's delight."
Flechazo,Meghna Basavaraj,13 May 2019,5,"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!"
Flechazo,Bhuvan Reddy,12 May 2019,5,I was there on the Mother‚Äôs Day and food was amazing . service by Jayanta ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggd
Flechazo,Ananya G,12 May 2019,3,"I went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

Good things first, the service is excellent! The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

Ambience: The place was jammed packed even for a Tuesday lunch. Couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

All in all a very okay-ish lunch!"
Flechazo,Sailaja,12 May 2019,5,"Love dis place...
Good in terms of ambience,food & hospitality


Live pizza & smokey ice cream are best...

Highlight was dance steps by the staff for birthday celebrations..."

Flechazo,Manikanta Sai Yarlagadda,11 May 2019,3,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and choose this place to have team lunch.

Rating

Ambiance: 4
Food :3
Service :4

There were many items on list but taste was not so good.

Don't be fooled by word unlimited beverages. only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can't choose the flavour.

Totally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good."
Flechazo,Harshith Batchu,11 May 2019,5,"Good place to hang out with friends , the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place...."
Flechazo,Uday Uddanti,11 May 2019,3,"Oh I had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all, but this just turned out to be an imitator of ABs, may be with few concept changes here and there. Ok the food is fine and all but it's just the expectation of being different."
Flechazo,Vidhatri Reddy,11 May 2019,4,An decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. The place was crowdy even on a week day. Servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. But the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. The pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment. Couldn‚Äôt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting. Would love to visit again.
Flechazo,Shaayar Shaik,08 May 2019,5,"Place was good for starters and mocktails.
Shabir was handy in service.
Pasta was to the top notch
Prawns were good.
Deserts are love. Must try their mini gulab jamun"
Flechazo,Shiva Sunny,08 May 2019,5,"one of the best place in terms of hospitality, food and ambience. 
Everything was superb.

Staters 5/5
ambience 5/5
main course 5/5
desserts 5/5

best of the buffet is their live counter pizza and smoky ice cream.

It has to be in ur list definitely."
Flechazo,Krish Bhattacharyya,07 May 2019,4,"4 stars:
Pros:
1.variety of starters
2.option to make pizza,pasta by your own hands
3.good biryani in main course(a rareity now a days!!!)
4.atleast 8 items in desert(the jalebi was specifically good)
5.staff behaviour

Cons:
1.only one soft-drink avialiable,for every day one flavour,so if you are unlucky u have to drink orange juice if you go on tuesday even if u dont like it
2.no hard drinks available

Overall a very nice experience, go and enjoy!!!"
Flechazo,Rajsi Gaikwad,06 May 2019,5,"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues."
Flechazo,Kiran Kumar Lc,05 May 2019,5,Loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow. Mini pizza and pasta is also good here.Thankew Sabir for your awesome service and helping us pick d best one. Had a good dining üòÄ

Flechazo,Tejasvi Sonkusare,04 May 2019,5,"I loved the food variety. You will get a lot of variety in snacks here. All are lip smacking I bet. The best thing I liked this place is the people serving here. You'll get to experience that personal touch. With every course of meal they take your feedback on how did you like the food, any changes they can make to improve. You can also come here to celebrate your special occasions, they provide cake and also play music for you. We had Mr. Jayanta as our host. He was super humble and served nicely. A big yes for this place!!!"
Flechazo,Vudugula Sai Anvesh,04 May 2019,5,Services is so good jayanta hasebul kusul has so good gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggjhhghhhhghhgghhghhhgghhggghhhghhggghhgggggggffgghgg
Flechazo,Amulya Mallidi,04 May 2019,4,"This is one place that provides a very good buffet for the price that you pay. The quality of food is great. They maintain a variety of items across each course.
The fish served as a part of starters was the best I had eaten in a very long time.
Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.
The service is good and the staff is courteous too.
But sadly, despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end, they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide. This was disappointing and could have been avoided."
Flechazo,Deep Sanghani,04 May 2019,5,"Soothing Ambience, admirable hospitality by shabir and buffet was delicious in every section,perfect place for family, friends and office colleagues."

Flechazo,Rupayan Banerjee,01 May 2019,2,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.
Flechazo,Surya Prathipati,01 May 2019,5,"I visited Flechazo today with my family. The ambiance is very pleasant. The service provided by Ranjit and Ramjan was excellent. Food was nice we have several options for starters, especially I liked fish starters very much. Main course is also very good. Coming to desserts I love the Ice cream they made on the spot. This provides several food options in all starters, main and desserts. One the best place to try with family."
Flechazo,Santosh Kumar,01 May 2019,5,Good Food and Friendly staff..Mehrul & Sourab have been best . Best Buffet in town. Fish in starters and Rabdi in desserts are to be tasted must.
Flechazo,Haritha Bompelli,01 May 2019,5,"very polite service done by shabir, starters Korean tossed chicken, oriental Devilled prawns were excellent. Veg flexhazo style crispy corn is good too"
Flechazo,Esta Philips,01 May 2019,2,"Apart from the starters; the main course, dessert, the wonky table we sat on was just a big disappointment. The ice cream was made with just cream and chocolate sauce with dry ice and that is not good."
Flechazo,Harsha.thamma,30 April 2019,5,"Very mild and refreshing taste. Best for starters and deserts. Thanks to Ramzan, Ranjit and Pritam for helping out with the dishes and continued follow up with the taste of the dishes."
Flechazo,Sahul Kumar,30 April 2019,5,"The food was amazing with good ambiance, the staff was very friendly, totally worth the visit. especially Ranjit and pritam we're too good at their job and concerned about their costumers. Visiting here again when in gachibowli."

Flechazo,Shilpa Prusty,29 April 2019,4,"This place serves buffet for lunch..It is a value for money dine restaurant.Although they claim to be a Mediterranean resto,most of the items served were that of Indian..So , don't go by its name.The service is really good and the chef personally asks your preference and feedback. The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.
Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.
Dessert spread was huge . Overall ,a good place.Hope they maintain the same variety at the same cost."

Flechazo,Epicure,26 April 2019,4,"I feel veg starters shud be improvised, we had mushroom, sweetcorn( which were very dry), kebab ( not properly cooked) n few others starters. They are not that tasty n didnot make a wow impact. Fish starter was awesome, prawn should be cooked more, chicken tikka was ok. Overall not convinced much with taste of starters. Maincourse was far better than starters and desserts were also ok. Can definitely visit but not with huge expectations on taste."

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Durga Anand,23 May 2019,3,"No that good when compared to Tolichowki branch... Starters are good. But not the main course and Biryanis.
Tolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Mikhail Wadhwani,22 May 2019,5,Used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Sandeep Sood,20 May 2019,2,"Food is good, but for the second time around they didn't send us our complete order. Had ordered 4 Naans, got only 2. Also got Daal Tadka instead of Daal Makhani. Not sure if its the Ramadaan rush, but now twice in a row our online orders thru Zomato have been messed up. Probably will avoid going forward."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Amar Singh,20 May 2019,5,Best Hyderabad biryani. If you are visiting Hyderabad and you are a non vegetarian you must visit this place and taste the authentic hyderabadi biryani.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Rishi Bhatia,19 May 2019,4,"I just went for the biryani, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. We ordered the special chicken biryani. It was spicy and tasty and seemed proper Hyderabadi. One dish enough for two people easily. Decent service as well.

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Ravi Munagala,19 May 2019,1,"I have placed order for Mutton Haleem Special - 3 Qty and Biryani Rice - 1 Qty. Shah Ghouse and Zomoto together delivered shortage of Mutton Haleem Special - 1 Qty, informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to Zomoto support. Zomoto team said that no response from Shah Ghouse regarding shortage delivery. Finall Zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value. Packing also very unhygienic. Totally upset with Shah Ghouse and Zomoto."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Priya Dasoju,19 May 2019,3,biryani was oily
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Arafath Ayubkhan,19 May 2019,1,"I heard Haleem will be so good, etc etc but taste is not that great as others said. Just boiled the meat and grinded like paste. Nothing special in it"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,EatandRep.eat,19 May 2019,4,"It‚Äôs a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for Ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems; shah ghouse.
Tip: ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me, it tastes much better. We also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Siddharth B.,19 May 2019,4,"Always the best... The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....

I deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.

The quality sets it apart from its competition. It is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...

I judge a restaurant by its consistency and Shah Ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Sandeep Khandekar,19 May 2019,2,"Ordered kaju panner, they have delivered chicken curry. So disappointed. Enquired with Zomato delivery boy he says we just pick the item and come."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Sumender Reddy,18 May 2019,1,I ordered mutton biryani for lunch today. The mutton was not cooked properly. It was hard and unchewable. I had high expectations from this restaurant as I had heard good feedback from a friend. I was really dissapointed.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Sushanth Humnabad,18 May 2019,4,I had shawarma so many times in so many places but no one can prepare like him it was so tasty and price was also okay and they always respect the customer instructions
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Deepali Yadav,17 May 2019,1,They send me wrong order I ordered mutton biryani and they send me chicken biryani and this app is worst app we can't even get in touch with customer care.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Saket Mujumdar,17 May 2019,3,"In regular days, its a good place to have a good Biryani. But during Ramzan, the quality of food goes down in terms of taste. But Haleem is always good here."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Avin Seth,16 May 2019,4,"The place to have one of the best Biryani‚Äôs in hyderabad. Chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome. The food is hygenic and well cooked. Chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try. Veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time.

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Asa Reddy Gorusu,15 May 2019,5,"Ordered haleem from shah ghouse, It has got really very good taste, quantity and consistency. Really satisfied with the order. But samll suggestion, please add some more dry fruits"

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Anu Radha Boddapu,10 May 2019,5,Shah Ghouse is a best place for Hyderabad biryani. Their quality and quantity are really satisfied. They have all the branches with same taste.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Mohammad Imtiaz Alam Taj,08 May 2019,1,"I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.

Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Netti Netti,07 May 2019,1,"When you will order ,you will get other item ..surprising restaurant..wheather you order chiken you will always get veg cheap cost item.

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Dileep,03 May 2019,4,Perfect place to order for mutton Biryani and mandi. Superb taste but a miner issue with this restaurant is it's so busy on weekends and they will not concentrate on ordered items and some times they deliver incorrect order. Otherwise it's awesome...üçñüçó
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Kishore Valdas,03 May 2019,2,The waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busy...if you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryaniü§®ü§®...Inam shocked with their behaviour with customers

I had ordered for mutton biryani nd I got noodles which are ugly... Wow I am so happy for that
Good keep it up(bullshit)
How careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for food
This is really disgusting and bullshit
I suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(Shah ghouse gachibowli)
Better remove service from zomato
Many of our friends had many issues from this restaurant, like delivering different food from ordered food, and delivering one shawarma instead of two and others
Zomato authority should take of all these problems which are spoiling the name and fame"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Saikumar G,03 May 2019,4,"Food and taste is fabulous, nothing there to complaint but the way they use containers for delivery need to improve. Sometimes for curry orders packages are leaking out. To be top all the facilities provided by restaurant should be in best qualityüòç"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Tahishi Gupta,03 May 2019,3,Ordered special chicken biryani. Biryani was great in taste but ambience was not good. Also this restaurant is too unhygienic and over crowded.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Manisha Panda,01 May 2019,5,"Absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing. You wouldn't mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good. You can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded. They serve the best mutton biryans, shawarmas and murgh musallam ( not sure of the spelling).
5 stars üåü only for the food ü§§"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Lovely Priyanka,01 May 2019,5,"Will be visiting this place at least twice in a month

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Debjit Hazra,29 April 2019,4,"The biryani here I found very delicious, worth of money. All spices were blended and mixed well, but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste"

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Prashanth Kumar,13 April 2019,3,Ordered Regular Chicken Biryani but the rice was not cooked and the i ordered double masala which i didn't get and the taste was not that good which was great when i ordered before.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Priyaranjan Sahoo,13 April 2019,5,Biryani is always tasty. The best part is restaurant remains open till late night. Whenever we have party plan we use to order from shah ghouse
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Nimra Siddiqui,11 April 2019,3,Taste is good but the service at gachibowli was really poor which compelled the guests to look for another option despite wanting to stay. ..
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Hemachand Yadav Gogula,11 April 2019,4,Mandi seema lovely items. Should definitely try it. But item should be hot üî• to better its taste. Service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Sanjay,07 April 2019,1,"This is bloody disgusting. I had to wait for more than 120 mins for my order. And after that got a call for cancellation of the order. If you can't sever the order let the customer know about it, don't made him wait for a long time. 120 mins of Sunday is precious for me. To hell with your service..."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Somrhita Kundu,07 April 2019,2,"I visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on Zomato. Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.
I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,AJAY KANTH ILLURI,05 April 2019,5,One of the finest biryanis i have ever seen. My favorite biryani rather than paradise or pista house. Very tasty food and good looking restaurant
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Suresh Maddula,04 April 2019,3,I have ordered Egg fried rice and some roties from here at night 11'o clock. The food was ok-ish. I don't know if I ordered in time. Roties were also not that much good.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Nagaraju Kondaveeti,03 April 2019,1,I ordered chicken biryani online.. Zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad..

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Ram Kumar,01 April 2019,1,"Worst food received, low quality rice was used, egg fried rice was almost spoiler, unable to eat. Worst experience ever, does not recommend."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,TASTE With Saurabh,01 April 2019,5,"It's one of the famous restaurants in Hyderabad for Hyderabadi Biryani. It serves several non veg items. This restaurant is quite crowdy. It's a good place for Family Lunch or Dinner.

instagram.com"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Jaswanth Chowdary,01 April 2019,4,It is completely biryani house.. You will not ‚ùå get satisfied every time. But u can't find these type of biryani in Hyderabad. Very crowded place have to wait much time to get a seat. Ambience is below. Price is very low when compared to other restaurants
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,DieEating,31 March 2019,4,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5
VFM : 4.7/5

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Anil Kumar,31 March 2019,1,The ordered veg biryani was without vegetables..I don't understand how this is called a veg biryani..the quantity is good matching to the cost.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Jitta Raghavender Rao,31 March 2019,5,"Great food. Okay-ish ambiance. Decent service. Exactly the place you want to dine with good ol' friends.
The likelihood of finding a parking spot during weekends is slim to none."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Majid Ali,31 March 2019,5,One of the best Biryani restaurant in Hyderabad. Kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious. Highly recommended for all non-veg lovers!
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Arpa Ghosh,30 March 2019,4,"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!"

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Rag,26 March 2019,5,Our regular place to have chicken/mutton biryani. The flavour is awesome. Can't get the same anywhere. Most favourite is special chicken biryani. The biryani will be completely different compared to the regular restaurants style.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Ha,26 March 2019,3,Ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani. It's was good as usual!! If they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant.
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Bhatnagar Benni Korani,24 March 2019,1,"Please don't visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your family...
No service after 12:00 as the zomato says it's open upto 2:00...complete missguiding and fooling customers....
I'm a fan of the biryani served here...but the staff,the timings,and the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshit...
Better to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowli...please don't visit this holy hell....!
I posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eat...yuck...!"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Raparthi Shekar,23 March 2019,1,I have ordered through Zomato 1 chicken and 1 Veg biryani and received Chicken and Egg biryani.  This is second instance happened.  I have thrown away the Egg biryani and also the taste of the Chicken biryani is not so good.....
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Nitin Bhapkar,23 March 2019,1,"Most disappointing experience ever! Ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant. Delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise I received only biryani rice, absolute no vegetables or masala. Very bland taste too. I do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock. I would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant"
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Gurtejbir Sandhu,22 March 2019,2,Horrible biryani this is what we got when we ordered on Swiggy. It looks like you just want to make money selling biryani and left over pieces

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Bhawana Bahuguna,17 March 2019,1,"I had heard a lot about this place so I went there. The dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins, food etc. I anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy. But then I saw a RAT nibbling on the scattered food. I reported this to the manager and he told me it's okay and 'ek do Galti toh ho jati hai' and they literally forced me to pay for my order which I did not even touch. The staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in Hyderabad."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Shiva Kumar Chary,16 March 2019,5,"Original Hyderabadi and ghee flavoured mutton Biryani is my fav item from this restaurant and I am totally addicted to this dishüòçüòçüòç

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,3,"Food is decent and tastes palatable, not the best, though not very comfortable with the hygiene. Ambience is average, service is poor. Good value for money if one can ignore the ambience and service."
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Prasun Gokhlani,16 March 2019,5,Can't ever say no to this place how much ever crowded it gets or the time one has to wait to get a seat here. Biryani is simply amazing definitely among the best in Hyderabad
Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Satyajit Behera,15 March 2019,1,"The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not. Pathetic service."

Chicken Tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting. Remaining items are better to ignore ( Roti and kebabs)

Dessert - kurbani ka meta is delicious.

Pros: Budget friendly

Cos: long waiting especially on weekends
Ambience."

Over The Moon Brew Company,Mithil Dave,18 May 2019,1,The managers are so rude to the customers. Twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days. We came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood. They seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry.
Over The Moon Brew Company,Pratik Das,18 May 2019,5,"One of the best places to chill and drink in Hyderabad. The Japanese fried chicken, the kung pao chicken and the beautiful ice cold brewed beer ( we loved the Weizen Bock beer) are the best.

Could be salsa or any other form considering they have so many...definitely they were not the guests, looking at their proficiency... Very good food... Not so great beer from their in house brews...

Not worth for money. 1star from my side"
Over The Moon Brew Company,Mahathi Natva,14 May 2019,4,"If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.
If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... This would be the perfect place."
Over The Moon Brew Company,Ruchi Tiwari,14 May 2019,5,"it's been always great to be at OTM, Kaishav has been a delight every time. great host, highly recommended for food and drinks. very responsive team and try to do whatever they can to make customer feel happy"

Over The Moon Brew Company,Abhishek Chaudhuri,13 May 2019,3,"This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed üç∫ (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table."
Over The Moon Brew Company,Vishnu S,13 May 2019,3,"Over the moon... Name is not matching with ambience. There is no roof top seating for this brewery. Outside seating was just average, atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor. Service was very quick and fast. Because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place."

The service was equally poor."
Over The Moon Brew Company,Subhasis Saha,11 May 2019,4,"Nice place to go to catch up with friends over a couple of drinks. Live music nights are really soothing and the ambiance is great.

Ambience: Its beautiful and so lovely and happening .
Food : We ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza .The chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland .
Dint like at all . The pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies.
Service : Its bad - really bad .. Might be the only reason i would not want to go again .

Food was good too.

Only reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some God damn reason was not effective enough. Be ready to sweat! We had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cool.

Oh yes, no surprise.. World famous kundan was serving our table, so no complaints with the serving partüòÖ

For a micro brewery they are quite kids Friendly."

A cold beer and OTM make for the best of times.Ditch the usual choices and try out their in-house specialities, you will not regret it. Bringing the microbrewery culture to Hyderabad, this place is a must for anybody looking to chill, beer and eat all the same time, plus they have games!!

Had ordered the white high pitcher, mutton kheema kothu parotta, basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom. The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element.

Over The Moon Brew Company,Sadiya,30 April 2019,4,"Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. Finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive"
Over The Moon Brew Company,Prateek Singhal,30 April 2019,1,The customer service was very bad. We ordered lobster and they served us prawns with lobster shells.

Over The Moon Brew Company,Devina Mohan,28 April 2019,4,"Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place."

Over The Moon Brew Company,Dr.vamsikiran,26 April 2019,3,"The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars."

Over The Moon Brew Company,Shubham Rajak,25 April 2019,3,"Went here to catch up with a friend, very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road. The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there. The seating was plush and comfortable. The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely. The preparation and plating everything was about perfect, but we did not liked the Lemon soda, it had some weird taste. In all it was good."
Over The Moon Brew Company,Anupam Acharya,25 April 2019,5,"Over the Moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from. We tried the apple cider(3/5), stout (4/5) and two others ( think one was called moonlit) (5/5) which were pretty good. The food was superb as well. We had the Burmese Parcel (5/5), Nachos (5/5), French Fries(2/5), Prawns (5/5), Chicken Kebabs(5/5), Chicken Poppers (5/5) and Mutton Kebabs(5/5). The place jas good music and later in the night people can dance. Overall an amazing experience in Hyderabad, which seemed to cover everything."
Over The Moon Brew Company,Arpit Singh,24 April 2019,5,Makhan provided really good service. Must place to go. Must try is belgian beer and stout. Chicken platter is good and fries platter is good to go for vegetarian
The Fisherman's Wharf,Himanshuwadhwa11,25 May 2019,5,"One of the best restaurants visited till date in HYD. The have amazing ambience, delicious food and extremely courteous staff.
They are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfied.
It is a must visit restaurant and has amazing North Indian food specially Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala. The desserts are also amazing. All in all complete value for money."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Jasmin,22 May 2019,5,"Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. Dinner last night at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf was one such memorable experience. Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Arunraj R,21 May 2019,5,Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Gachibowli. Get a fresh fish masala . You will love it for sure.Sit at the roof top and enjoy nicenbreezy air and feel of Goa
The Fisherman's Wharf,Ruby Mathews,21 May 2019,4,"If your a lover of seafood and Goa's vibes and charm, this place is definetly a must try, a good Weekend option for a lazy lunch.
They have a huge variety of sea food cuisine, live counters, live music, a bar section, lots of activities for kids and ofcourse the elders too, the vibes of this place will make you fall in love with it.
Ps: choose the outdoor seating for a lively atmosphere, ofcourse have the weather of hyderabad in mind too depending on the season."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Mula Renuka,20 May 2019,4,"This place is very huge and rustic and gives you the real Goa vibe. You sure would get amazing non veg and sea food but they have good veg options as well and in my five to six visits to this place I have covered the entire vegetarian menu. It‚Äôs mouth watering and delicious.
They also have live music on Friday s"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Arpa Ghosh,20 May 2019,4,"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

Final Thoughts

============= 
If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Pratiksha Sable,20 May 2019,2,Visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out ASAP. They were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. Tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Deepak Raj,18 May 2019,4,"One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

Ambiance--5/5

Taste--4/5

Quality and Quantity --4/5

Service--5/5

Presentation--4/5"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Tanvi Garg,18 May 2019,5,Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Upasana Motani,18 May 2019,5,"Great ambiance, its a theme from Goa but I'd say its better than Goa itself.
The food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.
My favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.

Would definitely love to visit again."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sawan Suman,16 May 2019,4,"Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.
Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.
All in all a great experience."
The Fisherman's Wharf,JashwanthBoppana,16 May 2019,5,"I have been there with my family. Mainly the ambiance and appetizers are just amazing.
Another main asset of the restaurant is the way there are presenting the food."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Suvashri Dey,15 May 2019,5,"Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches. They have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Gautham Maheswaran,14 May 2019,4,"Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.

The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.

Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)

Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sagarika Roy,10 May 2019,5,The ambience is really good. The food is good and especially the starters are delicious. Butter prawns were the best. We were given a great service by Mr Naveen. Would definitely recommend this place.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Mythreya Kommajoysula,10 May 2019,5,"One of the best places to chill in Hyderabad after a long week‚Äôs hard work. Love the place, the ambiance reminds of Goa and the food definitely yes. I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Moge Basar,08 May 2019,5,"Good for a nice Sunday brunch. The buffet for two is 1500 INR, and worth the deal, I'd say. The ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options. Would recommend."
The Fisherman's Wharf,CA Sai Sita Bommakanti,08 May 2019,5,"This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Ravi Varma,08 May 2019,5,"Perfect place for corporate dine outs. Had a great time with my team dinner. Wide variety of Goan dishes and other food as well as ""beverages"". A bit expensive but OK. The private space was good at 'Margarita lounge'"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Abhishek Kolpuru,07 May 2019,3,Overpriced! Coming to the weekends they doesn't make the food tasty! Fish was not good there is no flavor at all I the food . And 3* only for the ambience

The Fisherman's Wharf,Anuraag715,02 May 2019,4,This is a nice place. Food and cocktails are great. On the expensive side but its worth it for the feel good factor. Great service by the team and management.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Kiran Reddy,01 May 2019,4,Lovely location and really a vast place. Great ambience. Friendly and courteous staff. Great sea food. Loved the crispy calamari. Decently priced.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Madhav,30 April 2019,1,"Too costly... Tastes just ok.. And the service people don't have any manners also... I have zomato gold and I went there... As we are going to get free starter... They started treating cheaply...
Warning : Never go with zomato gold they will throw cheap looks... And treat you cheaply..."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Nilkanth C Patil,29 April 2019,4,"Wonderful ambiance one of the must go places in Hyderabad...., good food.... however reduced one star coz they have stopped their brewery and serving draught beer..."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Buddiga Sindhuri,28 April 2019,5,"Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

Ambience 5/5
Food 5/5
Service 5/5

Cost is resonable."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Priyambada Choudhury,27 April 2019,5,One of my favorites in terms of seafood variety and ambience. They have snagged the Goa charm pretty perfectly. We loved the prawn butter n garlic the best. Love to try their bebinka. Definitely recommend a revisit.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Monika Pandey,27 April 2019,4,"this place is really good n relaxing because of the ambiance.. loved the place, food was good.. it‚Äôs worth giving a try. live music is an add on to this"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Hyderabadisbest,27 April 2019,4,Went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. The place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either AC or outside. because of the heat we went inside. The starters and soup were served on the table. There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. Next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Dan,27 April 2019,5,"Great place to have seafood in Hyderabad, Goan style. Beautiful ambience. Lovely live music. Must visit place for food lovers. Overall great experience. Will visit again. Service was quick and friendly."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shivani Balmuri,25 April 2019,1,Very bad
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sourav Tripathy,25 April 2019,5,"The Ambience of this place is amazing. As the place is usually away from the city there's a sense of calm. Wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place available.
The only complaint is they have buffet lune up till Friday so the options for weekends are usually limited."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sohail,24 April 2019,4,"Been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my review.
Great ambience with tasty food, more of the chicken was delicious and juicy.
One should also try the fries of this place.
Would recommend people to visit this place.
Best time to click photos at this place would be sunset time and want to hear good live music then the weekend is the best."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Chef Tiwari,23 April 2019,5,"Beutifull indoor and outdoor sitting. Delicious food.we ordered man how chicken soup . ok
Loose prwans was good. crispy chilly pork so yummy .service is good"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Abhishek Shanker,22 April 2019,2,Bad for a Sunday lunch..the place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closed..most ordinary rooms with no music.. just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler. Extremely slow service. Food is tasty and that's the only reason one could visit the place.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Rajat Bhatnagar,22 April 2019,5,All kind of food is good here wrt al a carte. Go for famous dishes here e.g. crispy chicken. Not a disappointment for experimenting either. Dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes. Pricey for regular visits.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Niharika Rayat,22 April 2019,5,"Absolutely loved this place. Highly recommended.

Food: Delicious. Exotic. Hygienic. We tried lobster, prawns and red wine. We wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. Maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. You may not get all the items listed. 10/10

Ambiance: Beautiful. Live music. Great lightening. For parties and a nice dinner. 8/10

Service: Satisfied. They prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. Waiters were polite and nice. They served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. It was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Yuvan Kumar,21 April 2019,5,The ambience tells everything. The place reminds of Goa. The must place for dinner. The food is tasty and they should try the Goan delicacies.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Md Mudasser,21 April 2019,1,"Waste of money...
The worst place nd the waiter's was not cooperative..we have to call nd ask them to bring the starter...zero star..one of the worst experience ever had..üëé"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Rajen_6packfoodie,21 April 2019,3,"#6packfoodie goes The Fisherman's Wharf!

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

Peace‚úåüèª"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Gaurav Gupta,20 April 2019,5,"Went here while I was on my trip to Hyderabad, the place is really huge.
Best things about this place: food, variety of drinks, dessert and fish.
Price Wise it's expensive, food quantity is great.
We're a bit late, but still they arranged proper food for us."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Rajesh Raj,20 April 2019,5,What a amazing place where I feel wow.

Must try sea food space for fish ...

The Fisherman's Wharf,Venkateshwar Jayakanth,20 April 2019,2,Be wary when you visit in summer. Very hot and not ventilated properly. Average food. Alcohol content in drinks are below average. Ambiance is good
The Fisherman's Wharf,Yamini Natarajan,18 April 2019,5,"Away from the city, set up at a perfect location, beautifully lit, essence of Goa lingers all over.
Sea food lovers this is the place for you amidst all the hills in Hyderabad.
Tawa fry Fish is a must try.
Service is fantastic.
Music is mostly great.
Ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails.
Goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to Goa.
Special occasions like Diwali and Holi are also welcomed here like home.
Family or friends fits in good for both.
Finding a place in the weekend could be time taking so recommend to pre book a table."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Palak Jain,17 April 2019,5,"If you love goa... This place is nostalgic... It has sectons divided with the names of places in goa like panjim, colva, baga etc

You don't need to give a second thought to the ambience at all... Its perfect for a date or a group...

Good place to have corporate party...

Friendly staff...

Food is awesome veg as well as nonveg...

Must try... Chilli paneer , nachos, fried rice , chilli chicken, prawn

All the alcohol they mention in the menu is available so not to worry for that... even the beers...

Cocktails to try... Mojito, cosmo, mai tai, sangria ... These are what i tried and they are best...."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Ravi Kumar,14 April 2019,4,"Had been here a couple of times. Nice ambience, lots of place to sit. Courteous Staff Members Wil want you to visit this place again. The food is also nice. I think we indian restaurants should start asking spice requirements so that we don't end up getting spicy food."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Abhijit Aachi,14 April 2019,5,"I love sea food a lot and there are wide number of animals to eat üòÇüòÇ great ambiance, friendly staff. A non - vegetarian will enjoy this place for sure. Liquor prices are not goan prices üòÇ"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sruti Misra (Foodicted),14 April 2019,5,"Fisherman's Wharf is basically Goan themed restaurant with a huge seating area.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Syed Fayazuddin,12 April 2019,5,Been to this place today for team lunch and this is my third visit. My experience from this Restaurant is that never opt for Buffet. Go for a la carte you will not regret.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Srinivas Varma,12 April 2019,4,"Food :4
Service:4
Ambience:5

This is on the list for a long time and checked it off. Well it‚Äôs an Goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor. Coming to food we went at 5:30 pm so not much of a choice in menu. So ordered fish fingers and chicken starter, both turned out good. Will definitely try again."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Faisal Mohammed,11 April 2019,5,"The place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. Music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Lopamudra Tripathy,10 April 2019,4,"This has become my go to place now. We went on a Sunday evening, and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice. We ordered stuffed crab and I would say it is a must try dish. It was just mouth melting. In main course we had Goan prawn curry and rice and it was good. They also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shovit Chowdhury,10 April 2019,5,"It has got just awesome ambience. Must visit place for sea food lovers. The live music adds to elegance to your moments. The food quality is amazing , the staffs are polite and kind."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Moonis Ahmed,07 April 2019,4,"Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Anubhav Mishra,07 April 2019,1,"Dun bombard the menu with so many things, great hospitality and tasty food is what makes a place happening. Not coming to this place ever again"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Nawaz Mohammed,06 April 2019,4,"This is my third visit to the restaurant and surely im going again. It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a mehüôÑ
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go."
The Fisherman's Wharf,StomachFull/Fool,05 April 2019,3,This place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food. The menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead. Upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven. When we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went. Next u guys be the judge.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Gowtham Mahesh Balina,04 April 2019,2,"We have visited the place for Thursday Dinner buffet and kindly do not try it. They have very limited options of starters and the choice of spread was really poor. Even the selection of alcohol was very basic.
Service could be much better in the buffet section as the drinks order need to be provided. Overall it's a total disappointment.
Food - 2/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 4/5

Kindly do not try the evening buffet as it's very bad."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shashidhar Naidu,04 April 2019,5,"I've been there with my girlfriend on a weekend, the ambiance was soulful. A bit expensive but the food was too good. The staff could be more professional and my girl enjoyed a lot i should say. Hitting the Gachibowli road for long ride? Do stop-by there...."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Asha Akunuri,04 April 2019,4,"Been to this place on Wednesday evening for family dinner . On a weekday also the place was crowded.
The place is very spacious and there is not much to talk about ambience . It‚Äôs pretty simple . Service is at its best .
Ordered : Veg machow soup , fisherman wharf special soup , butter garlic prawns , masala fried prawns , fried fish , badami broccoli, Goan prawn curry , chicken wings, egg fried rice , curd rice. All tasted decently good except egg fried rice.
Must try : Badami broccoli , butter garlic prawns , chef special soup . These tasted extremely delicious and special mention about curd rice üëå"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Tathagat Verma,03 April 2019,4,"The ambiance and setup, basically the theme is just superb.
Very cordial staff and efficient too.

The highlight is of course, the food. Try the fried squid and butter garlic prawns. A bit expensive, but worth it.

Music is a little over the top, and unpleasant at times."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Gopinath Gunturu,01 April 2019,4,"Food wasn't up to the expectation. Friendly staff, the ambience was really good. Live music was very soothing. Would definitely visit again. Overall, thumbs up for replicating goa experience."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Riyaz Ahmed,31 March 2019,4,"This place is good for your friend and famlily.they have good variety of appetiser.
 Their service is very freindly. I have visit twise in this hotel  and also seafood verity is superb.. the dj was also great my over all experience was very nice..
Thakk you...."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Siddu,31 March 2019,3,"Situated at end of the city. Very Spacious and Ambience makes us feel like it was in Goa ! Theme restaurant like a fisherman's place ! Number of sea food items available! We can select a fish and make them prepare in customisation way ! We visited for a friend's party , ordered many items but we are not satisfied with the taste ! Soup tasted so bad ! Prawns and Fish items are not so much tasty ! Potato Starter was good ! Squats in fish was good ! Ordered Lemonade but not much great than I tasted before !"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Mahesh Kumar Unnam,30 March 2019,5,Awesome food and ambiance as always...best place to spend weekend...pre-book your table to avoid waiting...zomato gold acceptance is good...
The Fisherman's Wharf,Raghuram Kurella,30 March 2019,4,Should visit this place for dinner coz in summer you feel too much hot in afternoon that you can‚Äôt feel the taste of the food. Nice place for corporate team outing. Food was good and absolutely taste desserts first.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Anusha Sinha,29 March 2019,4,"Hi guys,

I went here as part of an office party. So can't really comment about the Al Carte.

The ambience is really cool. Full Marks to these guys for replicating Goa in such a great way.

The seafood variety is superb. All in all this place is good for people who eat sea food. The dj was also great. We had loads of fun."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Ranodeep Sen,28 March 2019,4,"Goa in Hyderabad!! These guys have cracked this juggernaut .

Ambience - 9/10
Service - 10/10
Food & Drinks - 9/10
Value for Money - 8/10

If you love Goa , this is the place to be in Hyderabad. No wonder they were packed on a weekday ( Wednesday)"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Pink Beforeuleap,27 March 2019,5,"Excellent food,and Amazing service by Jamiruddin. Fishes are very fresh. One must try their prawns,lobsters, and bebinca. In short complete worth its price."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Krishtanvi,26 March 2019,5,"Been to this place 4 times, the best in Hyderabad for sea food and ambience, service, cost all worth it. 10/10 best of the best love it.

We have ordered tandoori pomfret which was very fresh and perfectly cooked, prawns excellently done not over cooked, drums of heaven and heavenly. Main course was absolutely mouth watering food was served hot, staff were very courteous. Anoop one of the staff was very helpful and kind.

Would recommend to families, friends, couples anyone who enjoys good food and ambience."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Gaurav Yadav,26 March 2019,5,"I Never knew i had such a great place near my home to chill out on weekends has really good beer, non veg starters, good ambience and quick service. And the best Sea food in Hyderabad üòçüòç"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Anurag Singh Rajput,25 March 2019,2,"Very slow service, it took us more than 2.5 hours just to have dinner. Totally disappointed with respect to the amount of money they are charging."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Bharadwaja Pindiprolu,25 March 2019,5,Wonderful ambiance and staff were very pleasant. The music and food was extraordinary. Good place to hangout with all office family and friends
The Fisherman's Wharf,Dr.Mahesh Bapuram Reddy,24 March 2019,4,"The best restaurant to chill out but food was surely not up to the mark .. chilly chicken too sweet : )
They say 2+2 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it won‚Äôt be applicable as they use 60 Ml
In that ... they should have told this before ordering :) Fish is too good .."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Rajarshi,24 March 2019,5,"Every time I/we visit this place, it never fails to amaze with lipsmacking food. A 5+ service with 5+ food taste! Keep spreading love and warmth through your kitchen to our stomachs! üòç"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Abhimanyu Padmaraj,24 March 2019,5,"This place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast. The ambience is something you can get no where in Hyderabad. A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space. I have visited this place twice and I am so in love with the food and the ambience."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Vishnu Kaluvala,24 March 2019,5,"After so many recommendations we been there yesterday for couple of drinks...the ambience purely reflecting a typical Goan bar I can say it's simply unique place in the city where you can sit and enjoy fresh air along with Lite music , the staff where amazing I should thank specially Mr Dinesh ,Mr Rahul -thanks for the suggestion on food and drinks your recommendations satisfied our pallets and bellys hehehe..... the quality of food and drinks where awesome the service was very prompt thanks to Ashish,Zamir,Lalu and Naveen who looked after our table . Cheers guyz you people are rocking.

Dinesh and Rahul see you yaaa in next week ."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Amrita Sinha,23 March 2019,5,Kiran and Shiraz were sooper host..always smiling and on toes...Good recommendation for food based on our taste....so a big thumbs up!!!! Thanks Parijat for accommodating us at the spot we requested for on a weekend...Thanks a lot !!!
The Fisherman's Wharf,Yashmita Hota,22 March 2019,5,"Food: 9/10
Ambience: 9/10
Service: 10/10

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you‚Äôre interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Ankita Bhardwaj Singh,22 March 2019,4,"Good breezy sitting, great food, friendly staff... the place is a must try for all seafood lovers. The goa themed restaurant makes you miss goa the minute u enter the gate with a Goa 0kms milestone

Must try: cafreal chicken for starters, southern chicken.

Phata poster nikla hero: noodles and blueberry cooler

Parking: ample

Music: not too loud but entertaining and lively

Service: Super quick

Seating: Ample and comfortable

Served by: Mr. ashish

Dessert: try the goan delicacy bibinca (layered cake)



Visiting again: Definitely yes

Thanks Mr. Prajit and team!!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shishir,19 March 2019,1,"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.
Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Tulasiram Ram,18 March 2019,5,"Nice ambience and live band we have been visited with our family delicious food and nice cocktails had enjoyment time with nice sea food Verites we like fish starter with spices and Indian main course the service was nice by ashish, Komal and zamir..the cocktails taste good and boozy. We all are happily enjoyed with our family."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Nilesh Rana,17 March 2019,5,"I had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the Financial District road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Surya Sharma,17 March 2019,5,I went to this place with 7 friends. The ambience is really nice. The staff are polite n friendly. We had good time here. Food is really nice .
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shon Thomas Ninan,17 March 2019,4,"Surprisingly well versed ambience. The place is massive with a get-away-from-city feel. They serve wonderfully cooked seafoods(Goan focused). A tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I would recommend, to book table before hand; there are variety of sit outs to choose from. I would highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre a seafood lover."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sivayya Naidu,15 March 2019,5,"visited with family wonderful ambiemce and live band nice food and service by ranvir ,teja, kiran and mukul friendly and smily thank you guys we will vist again sure ."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Anuradha,15 March 2019,4,"PERFECT FOR DATE NIGHTS!!!

Beautiful place, with great food and amazing cocktails. Especially there Raspberry LIIT's. Great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu and I can assure you it will be great. The only set back is the service. Really slow, just place your order in one go."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Shiva Kumar,15 March 2019,4,Been the place for lunch and I loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as Goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place ..
The Fisherman's Wharf,Neha Singh,15 March 2019,5,"I love the Ambience! Food is mouthwatering. If you think you don‚Äôt like coastal food, do go here. Trust me food will get you there each time if you crave for sea food. Crowd is nice. A peaceful place to be with friends or family. Do go there."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Soumyajeet Bharadwaj,12 March 2019,5,Sea food cravings. Close your eyes and reach this place in Hyderabad. A very wide spread variety of sea food. Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. Thats the fun of it. Ambience awesome . Staff too good. Feels homely. Love this restaurant more than anything. 5/5 for everything.
The Fisherman's Wharf,Prasun Gokhlani,12 March 2019,4,"A must visit for sea food lovers, brings in GOA to HYDERABAD. Would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area. Great food and lovely ambience. A must visit !! Don't miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Sohan Dudala,11 March 2019,5,"Ambience is really good. Lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch! Coming to food, recommend trying only Goan cuisine. Didn‚Äôt feel the Buffet was special or so but their Ala Carte is real good. Sea Devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in Beacon, perfectly grilled. Butter Garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. Goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - Chicken Vindalho if you are looking for spicy or Chicken Xacuti if you want something less hot!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Farheen Dairkee,11 March 2019,5,"Great ambience, great food! I would recommend the pan seared fish üëå
It's a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it."
The Fisherman's Wharf,Aashima Bhootna,10 March 2019,3,"Visited this place on Saturday evening.
Had stuffed crab , fish starter, chicken in goan style ( was very spicy),stuffed chicken.

In drinks we had bull frog, drink was strong and tasted good

We went to have sea food here, only one crab was available that is very big one .

Ambience is nice. I didn't liked the food much.
This place is very expensive also.

Overall not very happening place"
The Fisherman's Wharf,Yugank Pant,10 March 2019,4,"A place with great ambience and good food. Here you pay for the experience. Which is great and rear.
Would love to visit the place again soon."
eat.fit,Pournima Gupte,25 May 2019,3,I had ordered gobi methi paratha.. it was ok. Not good. It was too oily. Not much taste. It tasted like it was a re-heated paratha. Not fresh.
eat.fit,Manish Aggarwal,24 May 2019,3,Food was good but it was all leaking from the plate. And so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing
eat.fit,Srishti M,23 May 2019,3,"Intially, yes,the food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very well,which is rare in Indian restaurant nowadays I don't see that happening these.Today I have found hair my fit thali,which shows how much hygienic they are ,apart from this so many times I have seen they miss on cutlery or few items. I mostly order fit thali so I know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing."
eat.fit,Basheer Shaik,23 May 2019,1,"Hyderabad's most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant Eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points, it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from Eat fit, just disguised about the biryani of the EATFIT Alaasss.. this is a Horrible biryani i had ate in Hyderabad"
eat.fit,Kirthi Kirthi,22 May 2019,4,Very good at quality guys..even packaging is extraordinary..but chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less taste.so quality quantity wise thumsup..but have to improve taste.
eat.fit,Bharath Kumar,21 May 2019,4,Thank you so much for the excellent food.it tasted great. Price quality everything good. I ordered via zomato online app. Delivery package was also great.if there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great
eat.fit,Priyank Sharma,19 May 2019,4,"Order no - 1127326452

Ordered rajma rice and what I received cold and badly smelly rotten food. Completely disappointed.

And Zomato is not even helpful to resolve it."
eat.fit,Gaurav,19 May 2019,1,"Last time I ordered the food(Tofu keema wrap, dal makhni and parathe) from here, I was delivered spoiled food. The wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner. I always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time, I wanted to ignore this But, still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault, delivery fault or a manual one."
eat.fit,Gautam Narang,18 May 2019,4,"Whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from. It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly."
eat.fit,Kiranpreet Kaur,17 May 2019,5,I had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome.. Healthy and tasty as well. Food quality was really very good. I had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review.. I couldn't help myself.. Fantastic.. Keep it upp.. U have raised a bar.. Do the good work always :)
eat.fit,Aparajita Deshpande,17 May 2019,1,I received food with a live green insect in it. What food standards are being followed! This is not expected from a restaurant with an ‚Äòexcellent hygiene‚Äô title!
eat.fit,Asha Dutta,12 May 2019,1,Zomato please help me to give them negative rating to this restaurant. I fell sick after eating their roti. How awful it is. If your food not good your packaging will not give u business
eat.fit,Roopashree NM,12 May 2019,1,Food was open
eat.fit,ANISHA SINGH,11 May 2019,3,I ordered dal makhani with paratha . The parathas were good so soft and tasty .Dal makhani was ok.It was tasting some different but it was good .üòä
eat.fit,#chloesviews // CAH,10 May 2019,5,"Very delicious millet and chicken dish.
I feel so good ordering and eating from eat.fit bc I can see the nutritional value and no where else I have found this yet! I love that they give a mini free desert too - perfect sweet treat after a meal."
eat.fit,Kiran Bishaj,06 May 2019,4,"Till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast
Pros
# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
# taste, quality are great

Now i felt few things can be improved
# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140. 
 I strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20% so that they can get more orders and new customers to"
eat.fit,Sahil S,05 May 2019,5,"Great food. No oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals."
eat.fit,Sukesh,05 May 2019,4,We have multiple options to have food but thinking about healthier options - there are very few. I would like to appreciate all your effort to provide us an option to choose heathy and hygienic food. Great place to order healthy and tasty food.
eat.fit,Sravani,03 May 2019,1,very less quantity and food taste also not gud
eat.fit,Khushboo Pandey,03 May 2019,5,"Ordered chef's veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome, 3 rotis, paneer curry( which had so many paneer) , salad, dal makhani, sweet, everything was equally good and tasty. Ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts I paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashback.
I totally loved it and would definitely order again
Quality-6/5 I did feel I am eating homemade, healthy food
Quantity-5/5
Value for money-6/5
Packaging- 5/5
Delivery- 6/5
It was a good experience ordering food from this place
PS this experience is when i ordered from cult app, later on when I order using Zomato things were quite different like delivery was late, no sweet"
eat.fit,Manishashah141,30 April 2019,4,Ordered lunch from this place. The taste was good. Food wasn‚Äôt spicy or oily. packing was good and quantity was sufficient. I would prefer to order again.
eat.fit,Zarar Khan,30 April 2019,4,"The food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours.
Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!
Have u hv had this kind of feeling ? üòÉ

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Suggestions:
Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!"
eat.fit,Sameer.khode,25 April 2019,1,"they don't deliver your food. They charge for food but may deliver only half of the order. and when contacte Zomato tell you that Restaurant no. is switched off. Strange, are they in food delivery busines or this is something else? beware"
eat.fit,Bishay Bishesh,25 April 2019,1,I ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for Zomato to deliver. Zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but I am never going to order from this restaurant. Also the food was below average. I ordered Tofu Keema roll.
eat.fit,Hussain Abbas,22 April 2019,1,Ordered a Wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. The quality of food seemed really bad that time. Although I tried reaching out to Zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. Till date I haven't received any response from either Zomato or Eat.fit
eat.fit,Riki Das,21 April 2019,1,Hey Guys!! I ordered Chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...The only plus point can be given for good packaging. But packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. The biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. It was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ Had a very bad experience...
eat.fit,Ketan Bassi,20 April 2019,5,If you want to eat something delicious without feeling guilty about eating unhealthy food then eat.fit is your go to place. Delicious tofu keema parantha having no extra spice's and perfect balance of flavors
eat.fit,Jasmin,18 April 2019,3,"For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).

Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads."
eat.fit,Vishwanth Reddy,16 April 2019,2,"Why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. Unless the buyers are fools.
Terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
All those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.
Oh boy, will never try üôèüèªüôèüèª

Btw, the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali üòÇ"
eat.fit,Vinay Kumar,15 April 2019,3,Forgot to give spoon and tissues
eat.fit,Navya,15 April 2019,1,Worst food ..... I would never order from this again... I ordered lucknowi biryani .... That turned out bullshittt.... It looked like timato chutney rice ....
eat.fit,Sankhadip Kumar,15 April 2019,5,"Eat healthy, eat.fit. Tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie. Both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these."
eat.fit,Subhashree Dey,11 April 2019,3,"We ordered 1 Luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. The taste was okay. Strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. But I haven't had Lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste."
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,08 April 2019,2,Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.
eat.fit,Swathi Y P B,08 April 2019,1,Delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps. He reached to different location and when I was trying to navigate him he said he don‚Äôt know the address which was mentioned
eat.fit,ASH&B2,07 April 2019,4,"Dal tadka awesome rajma chawal so-so, too garlicky"
eat.fit,Anil Rao,07 April 2019,5,"Food arrived wonderfully packed.  I ordered an omelette for breakfast and in the tray were also some beans, small portions of bread, potato wedges and roasted tomatoes.  A very pleasant eating experience - though the omelette and sides were slightly cold upon arrival.  I might add - for 160 rupees including delivery - the meal was an exceptional value."
eat.fit,Thehungryhyderabadi,07 April 2019,3,"Ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. The taste was good and simple. Feels just like home made food and healthy too. The breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun."
eat.fit,Vaishali,06 April 2019,1,I ordered from this place from Zomato. The amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. I ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. The juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. The potato flakes nothing more than normal Haldiram mixture. I am definitely not ordering next time.
eat.fit,Leher Sadhnani,02 April 2019,3,"A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è

Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.

So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus.

Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!"
eat.fit,Sharad,01 April 2019,5,"Great, hygienic and health food. Good packing.
All the ingredients look and taste fresh. More importantly, you get what you see.
I hope they maintain the veg non veg segregation.
A little expensive."
eat.fit,NayanNanda,31 March 2019,1,"Food quality and quantity is not up to mark. A family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 RS and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less. No raita or salan given. Not at all worth for money.
Quality is also not very good, didn't feel anything great about , worst place to order food. Sorry however that's the reality.. Thanks."
eat.fit,Nalini,31 March 2019,1,"I found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap I ordered from eat.fit. Apparently, not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be!"
eat.fit,Avinash Agarwal,30 March 2019,5,"An easy choice everyday among so many others for dinner. Not only is the food tasty, hygienic and healthy, their services, discounts and the entire cure fit package is just amazing and a well deserved hype success"
eat.fit,Sravanthi,30 March 2019,1,I had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous ü§¨ü§¨
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,29 March 2019,5,"Ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it's very delicious. I see that this time different type of oats(wheat based) are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher. Like the combination of oats, sabza seeds and milk & the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear, cranberries besides apple, dates, pomegranate."
eat.fit,Mona,28 March 2019,2,"Have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasn't up to standards. Ordered 'Chef's Special Combo for 2'. The salad and raita smelled bad. Weren't fresh. Had to throw them away. You folks have made a name, stick to its standards."
eat.fit,Anjali Tiwari,28 March 2019,1,"Had ordered veg pulao & rajma, it didn't seem fresh .. however I consumed it & couldn't sleep whole night because of vommiting & loose motion.
Will never order food from eat.fit again."
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,26 March 2019,4,"Super delicious nutty dates pudding. Simple dish made with wheat, milk, natural sweetener jaggery(gud). It was topped with almonds, dates, kishmish. There was no cashew nuts as specified in menu. Else would've rated 5.
Pomegranate protect was simply amazing. One can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. Satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)"
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,25 March 2019,5,"Fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. Surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. Oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. Superb taste enough for a person.
All eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was Guava glow. Could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. The pepper was unidentifiable in juice."
eat.fit,Jaswal Paramvir Singh,24 March 2019,5,Less quantity
eat.fit,Sumit Agarwal,24 March 2019,4,"Really healthy and tasty food. Quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price, hence expensive.

Would recommend dal chawal. The sweet they as complimentary are really good. Should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts"
eat.fit,Sachdevajyoti579,24 March 2019,3,quantity too less for a meal
eat.fit,Nikita Kumari,23 March 2019,4,"Ordered chicken thali for two from here. Loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the food.
A wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar.
A healthy alternative to oustide food if you're working out . Enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well."
eat.fit,Pragnyashree Mishra,22 March 2019,4,not valued for money
eat.fit,Harish Reddy,21 March 2019,4,"I strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories. I would suggest eat.fit to look after the quantity,because I think it's very little with this price tag. Apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing ,presentation,quality etc...All the best eat.fit."
eat.fit,Amrutha,20 March 2019,1,"I have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. I was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). As soon as I opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. The chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. I had to throw away everything. I don't think I can order again with trust on their food quality."
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,20 March 2019,3,"Dates tea cake was good. I was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. It was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier.
Topped with chia seeds, the Lemon tea cake was surprising as I could feel cinnamon. It was slightly oily. At first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake.
These cakes are Wheat based just as described which is a good thing.Though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, I wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website."
eat.fit,Karthik Reddy Katta,20 March 2019,5,"Health consciously designed menu and quality food. Packing is also very nice.
Keep up the good work.  Provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner."

eat.fit,Shilpa Sahu,14 March 2019,5,I ordered tofu keema paratha and it was really good with the right measurable quantity of healthy and delicious food. The food was perfectly packed.
eat.fit,Manideep M,14 March 2019,2,The taste was OK and food seems healthy. For the prices that we have the quantity is way less. Doesn't fill half your stomach. Overpriced. Worthless!!!
eat.fit,Jawa08014,13 March 2019,3,chicken was good..mix veg is very sweet..and small roties..
eat.fit,Asisha Ayachitula,13 March 2019,5,"eat.fit you beauty üòç

If there's one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong, it has to be eat.fit outlets.

I have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning. There was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burji.

If you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free, tasty and with great packing it has to be this place.

eat.fit provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I never, ever, ever knew healthy food can be so tasty.

Order now!!!!!"
eat.fit,Akshay Raikar,12 March 2019,5,Ordered this delicious healthy dish! ‚ù§ massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl... Loved it. Curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eat.fit. menu.
eat.fit,Charushila Biswas,11 March 2019,4,"Everybody is talking about Eat Fit these days! I was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!

I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. Hope they keep inspiring us :)"
eat.fit,Kartheek Karnati,11 March 2019,1,very poor food and my items were missing
eat.fit,Dhanasekar Kannan,11 March 2019,3,I had ordered chilly chicken Hakka noodles. It taste good. Chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy. Iam impressed with the presentation. Taste would have much better. It not taste like real Chinese cuisine. But I recommend to try atleast once
eat.fit,Swati Sk,11 March 2019,4,"Healthy food calls for eat.fit.. good packing and decent food.. price is a bit on the higher side
Rotis could have been better. Will definitely order more from here.."
eat.fit,Gael D'Marte,11 March 2019,1,"AVOID. This place is a scam. If there is even a place: I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. Anyway, I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food."
eat.fit,Chhavi Agarwal,10 March 2019,1,"Can you explain, how spicy food is healthy? In addition to this, the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless. Not worth the wait and money of course."
eat.fit,Smrati Saxena,10 March 2019,5,The food was amazingly delicious. I ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive. they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious. the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious.
eat.fit,Sai Dev,09 March 2019,4,"I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed 

Verdict 
Taste 4.5/5
Packaging 4/5
VFM 4.5/5
Overall 4.5/5
Zomato Delivery - 1/5"

Very impressed with the out of box concept of a superfood served with all items. Keep it up!!"
eat.fit,Abhishek Kumar,09 March 2019,1,Overpriced crap on the name of healthy food. The food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food. Quantity is too less at the price they sell.
eat.fit,Shirley Thomas,08 March 2019,5,"I have been wanting to have food from this place since a while as it had a good rating and reviews as well and the main thing here is ""healthy food"" unlike the other restaurants were we wouldn't even know how many calories we are consuming and I was thrilled to order food from this place. So I ordered Vegetable Pulao (BrownRice) and egg white masala curry and let me tell you it tasted yum and the packing was excellent. Damn I guess I'm gonna be quite regular in ordering food from here now!!"

eat.fit,Nikhil Lakhotia,06 March 2019,1,"You need to improve your packing. Had ordered veg Thai green curry with rice. By the time it was delivered to me, curry had splashed all over the container , even leaking from package. Zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it. Had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not."
eat.fit,Bharath Maguluri,06 March 2019,4,"It‚Äôs really difficult to get tasty healthy food. Eat.fit is kinda solving this problem. Food quantity is good, display of nutritional facts made me happy. I know what I am eating and can plan my day if following a diet.

Ordered Chicken Peanut Curry & Wok-Tossed Millet Bowl. Gravy tasted good with mix of veggies. Quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion. Millers were kinda dry,overall good experience for me."
eat.fit,Farhad Tarapore,05 March 2019,5,Great place to order decent food. Have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions. The taste is definitely great - especially their exotic chicken dishes. The indian menu is also very satisfying. Have developed a deep liking for their date pudding. It's great comfort food. The food is not oily and doesn't leave you feeling bloated.
eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,04 March 2019,4,"The berry blast smoothie tasted very good. Could actually feel the taste of papaya, watermelon, blueberries,etc and can even make them out. The quantity was a big disapointment. The bottle was thin as well. The smoothie was finished in few gulps."
eat.fit,Purna Redrowthu,03 March 2019,1,Taste is not good and also not freshly prepared. It seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner. Also not spicy.
eat.fit,Deepac Mishra,03 March 2019,5,"Highly recommend this place. The entire menu is so captivating and pleasing at the same time with a thought left in your mind that ""yay don't worry you are eating healthy"". And the food literally looks healthy no excess oil no hints of butter etc it's simply delicious and perfect. I tried Dal Makhni, Paneer Curry, Masala Chaach and Tofu Keema Wrap all were fantastic in order of my mention .ü§ü"
eat.fit,Sivprasad06,28 February 2019,2,"I ordered Thai chicken rice. First of all, it is on the expensive side. Second, the quantity wasn't good, third it was spicy. Seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food."

eat.fit,Satish Patnala,27 February 2019,5,I've ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates .its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable price.it tastes delicious and oats taste good .if you're on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that you've ever asked for .keep it up guys .
eat.fit,Mallikarjuna Maddu,23 February 2019,1,I have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao. Which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money.

eat.fit,Pallavi Tiwary ( FoodLicks),20 February 2019,4,"An awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food .Strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy, fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered. U dont have to worry about the calories.Every dish comes properly labelled with it's nutritional value, so you know what you're having."
eat.fit,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,19 February 2019,5,"Ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. It comes well packed in a big box. The quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. We also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. Dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. The curd was fresh and good in taste as well! Loved the over all parcel!"
eat.fit,Shaik Mahaboob Subhani,18 February 2019,3,"Dear eat.fit , what on Earth charging you 180/- ? For this 3 rotis, 2 spoons of veg curry, enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita
I am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.

3 star is for taste and quality. But quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
Very poor"
eat.fit,Mayankrawat1989,18 February 2019,1,"I ordered from eat.fit and sorry to say the food was at all not good. Both taste and quantity were below my expectations.
The food I ordered was Masala egg curry with Vegetable Pulao with Order Id: 1676056120

Zomato delivery guy when delivered I realized that curry was spilling from the box. When enquired he said this is packaging problem.
After Zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. 
After opening the box the food was just half a bowl. Rice taste seems to be of very low quality. Bad service from eat.it and from Zomato.

My first and last order from eat.fit. Already uninstalled Zomato . Overall very unpleasant experience."
eat.fit,Siva Raju,18 February 2019,5,Quality of food and packing is good.. Quantity is less in the bowl.. My advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity won't be sufficient for an individual.
eat.fit,Rasheed Khan.M,18 February 2019,5,"Great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time, thanks to Zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us. Eat.fit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing"
eat.fit,Razia,17 February 2019,1,"This restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
And after a long hard work I found one contact through zomato customer service .....which was also WRONG
This shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
They have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
Moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them

Poor show

I would give a half star

Horrible experience with eat.fit"
eat.fit,RENUKA DEVI Katikala,17 February 2019,4,"Ambience:NA
Service: NA
Food: very tasty and healthy. Dry fruit laddu is best part of athletic meal.
Matar patti with tomato curry is very tasty, soft, rich flavour of tomatoes enhanced the tast even more.

Dal makhani with parata
Food &quality: 3/5
Dal makhani is chatpat no other flavour. Parata were pure wheat made but they were hard when I received. Sweet was not good at all but mix of sounf, sesame....
Overall it was ok.

Dal Makhani with tawa roti
Packaging: Very good as always
This time I received hot roti and tasty dal makhani.
Small sweet box have peanut chikki.
Overall it's a good place to order food."

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Leher Sadhnani,14 May 2019,4,"Was surprised to know that SG runs a Shawarma hub too. All thanks to SG biryani's which made me order Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it. The delivery, packaging, taste and quantity was perfect. Trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy. It came without vegetables, and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end, it is always best to have little extra mayo!"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Avishek Chakraborty,12 May 2019,2,"I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.
Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.
Cheers"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Kiran Sagi,11 May 2019,5,Super taste and packing was nice. This is one of my favourite food. And we had with friends everyone gave same rating. we enjoyed a lot. Thanks Zomato
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Anu Nand,11 May 2019,5,I bought food from them twice. Rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. Both were good and tasty. I liked the Libby shawarma more and the Rumali was also good but Libby better. The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Bharti Mehta,11 May 2019,2,"Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Navaneeth Reddy,05 May 2019,5,Shawarama from this place is like heaven . No doubt we enjoy every bite from it . Try dry fruit chicken shawarama for sure . Thanks Zomato and Shah house for such mouthwatering dishes
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Nikhil,30 April 2019,1,While I am eating my food I get this in my food the steel wire it cut my tongue inside. The worst experience while having my food i am suggesting don't buy shawarma from shah ghouse
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Pratyush Nanda,29 April 2019,5,Delicious and timely delivery! Dont miss the roomali shawarmas! Im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while I worked into the night.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Tarak Chowdhary,24 April 2019,4,"If you want Mouthwatering bites then this for you guys. Hyderabad's one of the best Shawarma.

Recommended- spl rumali malai chicken shawarma

Likes-
Packed with protein.
Balanced spices.
Creamy texture.

Dislikes-
Waiting time.
No dine-in place."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Pratap,24 April 2019,3,"Had tried Chicken Shawarma, Lukmi, Samosa, Veg Puff, Egg and Chicken Puff.
Chicken Shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. It tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. Overall Didn't meet my expectations.

Both Lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. Better to go for samosa instead of Lukmi, the taste was ok though.

Comming to the Puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. Not a big fan of these."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Naveen T,23 April 2019,1,"Some pieces of chicken are totally uncooked (raw) and important thing, I had ordered for two shawarmas and I got only one, I don't know what went and whose fault it is....
One who delivered, he was saying that you had ordered only one... When I spoke with the person of hotel who answered my call, said that it may be delivery boys fault,
Seems that no value for customer queries..."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Jit Mukherjee,23 April 2019,2,Not very pleasant experience with Shawarmas here. Was very tasty but got hard time digesting. Unpleasant burps until took medicine. And it was not only me but my friend also experienced same.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Shiv Kumar Chintapalli,17 April 2019,5,"As in the name, the shawarma is truly special. And it's more than the money it costs. Tastes heaven. Delivery is quick as well.
So it's the right thing to order if you want some tasty chicken to kill your hunger"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Hoang,16 April 2019,5,I tried 5 highest rating Shawarma places in Hyderabad and this is the best + most filling place. Simply amazing. The special rumali is the best.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Anil Rao,13 April 2019,2,"I ordered a chicken rumali shawarma just now from this place and added instructions in my order NOT to put that slimy, greasy ""mayonnaise"" some of these places are famous for. Lo and behold : opening the food parcel was the item with the awful slimy, sickening mayo I had requested not to be added!  And I might add - there was only meat and mayo - no vegetables such as included in shawarma ordered from better places (this was listed as ""special shawarma"")."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Shaik Mujahid Dadapeer,10 April 2019,5,"The Dry Fruit Shawarma is awesome and every time I've ordered two for my self and I've finished as well, The only hotel I love in entire Hyderabad is Shah Ghouse."

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Manish Mehta,01 April 2019,4,I must say i did not expect much after trying a few so called famous shwarma shops in Hyderabad. But I think this one equalled if not bettered istah shawarma house. The chicken pieces were cooked amazingly well. Loved the cream. Packaging could have been better.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Shilpa Shaji,30 March 2019,1,The shawarma roll had uncooked meat! I got pieces of bones too! I'm very much disappointed with Shah Ghouse spl Shawarma! The quantity may be sufficient enough but quality matters more. If uncooked...it is good for nothing.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Naveen Joshi,25 March 2019,5,excellent to taste
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Vinay Chandrakar,24 March 2019,1,Late delivery almost after 30 mins
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Mohammed Sami,22 March 2019,2,It was not the same like before. There were big big pieces of chicken instead of cutting them into smaller pieces.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Jamini Mohan Gogoi,22 March 2019,5,good for late night cravings
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Abhishek Katta,21 March 2019,3,"Authentic biriyani. Must try the platters. Its an old and good brand. The service is not up to the mark given their confidence that people will come no matter how they treat customers. The food will cool you down even if their behavior is not good. Overall, okay experience."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Ram Reddy,19 March 2019,1,"Ordered special rumali chicken shawarma, was delivered uncooked chicken with a soggy rumali roti! Not worth the name!! Never ever gonna order!!"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Sarvesh,17 March 2019,2,"Very spicy shawarma, not for people like who don‚Äôt eat spicy. Based on rating went to try but it was very spicy couldn‚Äôt finish it and ended up having upset stomach."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Joel ManohaR,17 March 2019,4,Delicious shawarmas I tasted over here. So try here once in life time . Especially I like samoli and khaliooz. Rumali is not so good. Nice nice
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Gaurav Sharma,12 March 2019,1,Never seen any place that is so unhygienic and dirty. Place is so dirty I have no words. Never seen anything like this. Not sure how people order and eat here.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Rishis Digitalmarketing,11 March 2019,1,Yesterday i ordered dry fruit shawarma from this restaurant nd it disturbed my stomach so much. At olden days it was so good but now they are giving worst Shawarma.. I instructed to add extra mayonnaise but there is no minimum mayonnaise also.. Chicken is so hard to eat cant eat it..i informed about this to zomato they are not responding nd either restaurant not responding ..dont try Shawarma here nd ruin ur health
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Dhruv Bhatt,08 March 2019,2,"One of my chauffeur in Hyderabad recommended this place for authentic Persian food. And I was disappointed. This place didn't live upto the fame and name. The meat wasnt well cooked. The taste was bland. The service was fast, however the quality of service was a disappointment. A cold finger bowl at the end made it worst. Ambiance 0/5, service 2.5/5, staff 3.5/5, food 1/5, value for money 1.5/5."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Onefussyfoodie,05 March 2019,4,"This place promises to be one of the good Shawarma outlets in Gachibowli. Drive down there for Shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles. So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues. My 5 Star rating is still pending for the best Shawarma."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Vinay Kumar,01 March 2019,1,I did not expect like this from shahghouse ..1st time sharwarma with bun..and it is SPL ...And on the cover it S G is shahghouse or another doing on your name in online...please check and do better..
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Samrat Ghosh,28 February 2019,1,For the first time when I has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again... but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically... the best shawarma I had is at SK Shawarma DLF and other opposite to food bazar nizampet...
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Prashanth Kumar,28 February 2019,2,Chicken taste is not good
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Aniket Sharma,23 February 2019,5,Was a great having one of the best shawarma...Everything was just as perfect as it could have been...and specially try the the one shawarma with that Malai one...that is the yummiest

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Athira Thilakan,16 February 2019,5,"One of the besstt places to order shawarma. This is a Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma. The chicken is so tender and juicy, the spicy shawarma with mayo/malai hits right on your taste buds. The quantity is filling and overwhelming. I love this place and I do recommend this place to all my non veg lover friends. Great quality & quantity of food. Keep it up! ü§ò Wish I could give more than 5 stars!"

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,ImmanueL M (MooD),07 February 2019,5,"This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,T V Satyanarayana,06 February 2019,5,"This place serves the best shawarma at the most reasonable cost. Everyone should try shawarma at this place. The shawarma is totally stuffed with chicken,the fattest shawarma i ever had."

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Benson Benny,02 February 2019,4,"Although Shah G is famous for its late night dine in facility, the Shawarma is pretty awesome too. A Shawarma with a single Irani chai in the evening is so Hyderabadi"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Venkat Chary,01 February 2019,1,badWe are ordered at around 5pm but that's delivered by 7:15pm
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Vinay,25 January 2019,3,Over sausage in the shawrma roll

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Somasree Sengupta,15 January 2019,2,Didn't like the quality. Seems like it's been stored
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Prakhar,13 January 2019,4,"One of the best shawarma joints in Hyderabad.
The quantity is enough to satisfy one's craving for shawarma. Chicken is tender and juicy and mayonnaise does its work like a charm with the chicken.Must try Special rumali shawarma.If you are a North Indian and love shawarma then this the place for you. Chicken lollipop is also one of their specialities."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Raghu,11 January 2019,4,"Been to this place plenty of times.
Ordered special rumali and khubus.
Falafel is also good
Very busy and
should wait for sometime for the order.
Parking is hectic.

Overall worth a try"

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Roja Ramani,19 December 2018,5,"Shawarma at Shah ghouse is very tasty...
I love to order it from Shah ghouse only..
Quantity of a shawarma at Shah ghouse makes your stomach happyü§ó..."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Kaushik Padmanaban,09 December 2018,4,"Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Abhay Bansal,07 December 2018,4,if u look at the they make it u wont even try it. but once u try it u wont forget it. its aswum. place is dirty and lack cleanliness and hygiene. but taste is really gud and pocket friendly too
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Manohar Vihari,04 December 2018,4,"Shawarma here is the best. It tastes different from every other shawarma joint. The way the chicken taste is just amazing. Don't know about biryani, but if you are looking for an amazing shawarma experience, you must try this."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Ashok Prabhakaran,04 December 2018,4,"A very popular shop nearby the hotel I was staying in Gachibowli. Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. 

Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,NagaMahesh Busam,25 November 2018,5,"Best shawarma place in Hyderabad, quality and taste is too good. Eat to have best shawarma in Hyderabad, go to Shah house. Very rush during night time"
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Aditya Kumar Singh,12 November 2018,4,The best shawarma you can have is here. The quantity and the quantity both are awesome. One shawarma is enough in terms of dinner or lunch. I always prefer to have from this place
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Nagalakshmi Tenti,27 October 2018,5,food is good
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Rajasekhar,25 October 2018,1,worst taste i ever had
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Shabahath Ali Sufi,23 October 2018,4,Ordered Special Chicken Shawarma Rumali and Special Chicken Shawarma Samoli. The taste is amazing and the quantity is also good and sufficient for one person. The online order facility is only available through Zomato. Giving Minus -1 for oil and the amount of spice as the Shawarma is Oily and Spicy but it's taste awesome. Feedback for this great place would be to make it a little bit less spicy.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Ashok,23 October 2018,5,goid service
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Harsha Kanchina,20 October 2018,5,"Waah! kya shawarma man!

Really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti. This is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. The only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. Do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.
P.S. The chicken is on the spicier side though."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Oindrila Rahaman,16 October 2018,3,"Rating 3.5/5
Although very little resemblance with the Lebanese shawarma wrap, the Rumali roti shawarma tasted good. The wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too. But once again, the chicken was quite spicy. So if you are looking for healthy food, this shawarma isn't your call. Very fast delivery."
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Hanuman,15 October 2018,2,shawarma is not tasty. need to improve in taste
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Akhila Satyanarayana,14 October 2018,1,wrong item received
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Ritesh Srivastava,11 October 2018,4,Shawarma was really good and full of chicken but but but chicken was too much roasted and there was lack of mayonnaise which should be increase to make it feel like juicy...
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,O√ëlyme Nishi,10 October 2018,5,good taste
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Syed Nazaf,08 October 2018,1,Shawarma is not like shawarma. It's like rumali roti filled with chicken khorma or sweet roti filled with leftover chicken curry nd some mayo in a corner that you might have to search.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Jayant Soni,06 October 2018,5,quick delivery
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Shaik Azeem,04 October 2018,3,late delivery

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Lakshman Ch,14 September 2018,1,Chicken in the shawarma is stale and stinking... Went to the place and was very unhygienic. Won't ever order anything from here. Shah ghouse quality is pathetic.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Anil Chinna,14 September 2018,1,You ppl always miss the curd and raita and lemons on Biriyani order form this application please provide all the things along with food. If you don't change this ppl definitely look your collapsing in soon.
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Sonali Bebo,13 September 2018,3,"Chicken shawarma is awesome.. but ordered veg falafel too, with instructions not to put cucumber(kheera) because I am allergic to cucumber.. but have ignored it n made me fall sick... Also,I mentioned extra mayoneese which wasn't there!

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Suresh Reddy L,03 September 2018,1,Chicken inside the Shawarma got spoiled and smelling too.. Once opened it and was smelling spoiled.. Before ordering only I thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time... But due to the trust on shah Ghouse ordered it.. And initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it.. I last order I thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday I ordered shawarma and he repeated the same.. Food quality In shah Ghouse getting bad day by day
Hyper Local,Antony Peter,25 May 2019,4,"Man this place. Hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill, eat and drink.
The food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part.
We tried almost everything on the menu (perks of zomato gold) and nothing really was a disappointment.
The place looks amazing and has a cost feel. They have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing."
Hyper Local,Punitha Battu,20 May 2019,5,Best place to be to hangout with your loved ones üëåüôåüèª ambience and taste of food... one no need to comprise on that.. friendly staff.. staff sandip very humble and understands your taste.. worth being there... good value for money
Hyper Local,Sonam Biswas,20 May 2019,5,"The fisrt time i came here, fell in love with the ambience. The food is good and priced nominally. Sandeep was so helpful in choosing the right choice of food & drinks"
Hyper Local,Farzana Shaik,19 May 2019,1,"My peace of advice pls don't waste your money. Over pricy, but buffet spread has very less items. Very much disappointed and the food was not even hot"
Hyper Local,Satyendra Kuvelkar,18 May 2019,2,Had visited for lunch buffet.to my surprise at 2 pm most of the dishes were hardly left and were not replenised.also service is slow had to wait even to pay bill inspite of the fact that it was half occupied.had much more expectations for that price range.definitly not value for money.
Hyper Local,Shravya Rao,17 May 2019,1,Food was not that great just ambience was good very very conjusted sofa area worst ac service was good but I dnt recommend this place for food
Hyper Local,Areeba Fatima,15 May 2019,5,"Been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon! Absolutely loved the ambience. In Food , starters were amazing . However, main course and desserts could be better. We booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj. Absolutely customer friendly service.

Overall,
Ambience - 5/5
Dj-5/5
Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Will recommend for partys with friends!!"
Hyper Local,Food&Bikes (FaB),14 May 2019,4,"Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area."
Hyper Local,Abhijeet Mahapatro,14 May 2019,4,"Visited this place while IPL screening. They were running couple of bucket offers on drinks and food. Ambiance is nice and you get the botanical garden view free of cost. music is too loud for me. we ordered one Pizza and a chicken starter both were good.
Ambiance: 5/5
Music: 3/5
Food: 4.5/5
service: 4.5/5"
Hyper Local,Kumar,12 May 2019,5,Good taste of food and nice ambience.staff are really friendly@sandip.music was really good and atmosphere was energetic.its good place to njoy with friends and family
Hyper Local,Chayan Jain,12 May 2019,1,Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy.
Hyper Local,Abdul Qadir Ali,12 May 2019,5,Visited this place on Friday first of all I would like to compliment DJ zain sabri for playing whatever song I‚Äôve requested and the food was good the ambiance was perfect for me and my friends we‚Äôll surely come back.
Hyper Local,Epicure,11 May 2019,5,"Very fast deliveries , quality and taste were very good be it veg/nonveg. Njoyed the big screen, music, dance floor, drinks, food, ambience..!!It was a ladies night on most of the fridays which makes the pub more lively as well. You must definiely visit this on a friday night!!!"

There is a nice balcony to sit and enjoy ur drinks."
Hyper Local,Yaswanth Atyam,08 May 2019,3,"One line #Only4chicken üòú, Ambience is good with large screen inside and nice atmosphere outside. Coming to food you will not find any item other than Chicken for Non veg and Aloo for Veg üòÇ. Service is very poor I hardly see two people serving and cleaning. Can give a try only once with friends by going for early bird Buffet."

Hyper Local,Tarun Digavalli,07 May 2019,5,"# DJ Hardcore Saturdays
# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies..."
Hyper Local,Thunderbird,06 May 2019,5,"Very nice and cozy place with good ambience. Food was also great. Staff was also courterous, we were served by Sandeep who happened to be a really polite and gentle person. Overall I would highly recommend the place."
Hyper Local,Sanjeeth Kathuri,06 May 2019,4,"Good place to Hangout and party... place is for party lovers. Can enjoy good food, watch Ipl and music ... Staff is polite ... Zomato gold is accepted..."

Hyper Local,Vibhor Dhote,04 May 2019,3,"I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.

Also the live music there wasn't great."

Hyper Local,Sajjad Ali Khan,03 May 2019,1,"All services delayed, menu changes, very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it‚Äôs menu from Delhi and can‚Äôt help. Inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. Asked for French fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. Ok last one came finally when THE MANAGER arrived after being aggressive. They want to offer free drinks but it‚Äôs not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back."
Hyper Local,Abhinav Tyagi,03 May 2019,2,"This was my second visit to the place and I am very disappointed for the following reasons:

1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

I dicided to give it another shot and came again.

2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience."

Hyper Local,Yaksh Kishore,28 April 2019,1,"Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.

The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

Really disappointed"
Hyper Local,Survivingforfood,28 April 2019,5,"Follow me on instagram :- Survivingforfood

Heyy peeps , was here for sunday late lunch , this is my first time visiting this place .

Ambience :- They have both indoor and outdoor seating as well , indoor was totally chilled and relaxed place where we have screening going on any movies or songs as it is IPL season mostly we can get to see the match screening . I loved the luxurious seating of inside which was so comfortable and we can lay back and enjoy our food .

My favourite seating was outdoor from where you can see the breathetaking view of greenary sky and sunset . The best view while having our food i soo loved it i completely had a pleasant view and seen some peacocks as well üòç .

Hyper Local,Pavan Singisetty,27 April 2019,1,The food is cold even after repeated requests for warm food. The service is pathetic and slow.. Am sure this place is going to close in couple of months. Will never visit again even if they offer free buffet. This was the experience of everyone who were at the restaurant this afternoon.

Hyper Local,Moumita Ghosh,24 April 2019,5,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance."
Hyper Local,DS Singal,24 April 2019,3,They have worst north indian food i believe. Spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food. But other than that chinese and continental was good. Their safe sex on beach deink is great just.
Hyper Local,Suparna Banerjee,23 April 2019,4,"Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ

I ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.

It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts."
Hyper Local,Ashwani Kumar,23 April 2019,5,Amazing place and best to chill out with friends.Specially the outdoor ambience we simply loved it as well as the food was also nice and along with the service

Hyper Local,Mugdha,21 April 2019,4,"Went on a Saturday night. It was ladies night. I enjoyed the feel ambience, music and dance floor. I wish there could be a better system for ladies night rather than queuing up across bar counter n shouting to be Heard amongst over enthusiastic young ladies pushing you around.
Feel was just right n Music was bomb.. danced till we drop"
Hyper Local,Mahesh Kumar Unnam,21 April 2019,4,Pizza is good...nice staff...ambiance good but better to visit night time to see the beauty of lights...place is very quiet during day time.

Hyper Local,Sonu Anand,20 April 2019,2,"Food - 4/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 1/5

I visited the place last week. The food was tasty and so was ambience but I have serious concern with the services.

We asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. The waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.

It was highly irresponsible.
Also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque.

Please train your staff if you want to ."
Hyper Local,SANDEEP RAJ (THE FOODIES),16 April 2019,5,"Nice place for hangout.............. and sevice was too great, n server nitish is treat like as friend.....
And his suggestions is very amazing ..... So plz meet him before service.........."
Hyper Local,Shalu Singh,14 April 2019,4,Amazing place to chill. Live music and ambience is up to the mark. Food is fine. They should include some options in mocktails and drinks. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.
Hyper Local,Mohammed.taranum,12 April 2019,3,One place to order pasta when you‚Äôre hungry in office also stomach filling with two toasted breads if your hungry want to order something quickly without scrolling down much just order it and wiat for the food
Hyper Local,Anshuman Sahu,11 April 2019,3,Menu needs a major overhaul. Not for a large group of people. Not for everyone due to limited items in menu. Mocktails are damn expensive. Ambience not as good as few competitors.
Hyper Local,Kumarsunil Kasta,11 April 2019,5,The place is within the SLN mall in gachiwali.we took the inside seating.the ambience is petty coll.we had couple of beer & long island ice tea with chi 65 which is yamiüëç
Hyper Local,Nag Vamc,11 April 2019,3,"There is a cafe named Hyper Local Cafe in Manikonda ,I don‚Äôt know if this belongs to the same one but went to this place with certain expectations but was disappointed...it has quite a good experience,especially outside there is a nice setup ,leaving that apart ,food was not upto the mark ,Had Butter Naan and two chicken curries which really didn‚Äôt make me happy..they can improvise and can work on the taste

Food: 2.5/5
Ambience:4/5
People:4/5"
Hyper Local,Naina Hussain,09 April 2019,4,"Hyper Local is the perfect place for a Saturday night for a party scene.

Hyper Local,Rajitha Mani,07 April 2019,1,"I had the worst experience here on April 5th, 2019. I came here with my friends. They first served cold non veg platter. However, the worst came in when we ordered Momo's. The container had three cockroaches running around. We returned it immediately. The music was pathetic as well. We left the place as soon as we could."
Hyper Local,Ankita,07 April 2019,4,We liked the chhole bhature as it was not at all oily. They serve good Italian dishes as well. Pizza crust is baked well. Service can be improved.
Hyper Local,Deepika,07 April 2019,5,"Bartenders are very courteous and well behaved. Great place to hangout on Saturday night.
Good crowd and beautiful indoor and outdoor seating is available.
Service is really good.
Starters are good!"
Hyper Local,Himakar Yv,07 April 2019,3,"They have this amazing IPL offer
600 for 4 pints & french fries
Nice ambience
A bit expensive otherwise
The view is really good spanning the whole city"
Hyper Local,Anmol Singh,06 April 2019,1,"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

Be aware people. Avoid this place."
Hyper Local,Sanika Samant,06 April 2019,3,"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
The music was extremely loud for the place.
Overall we had a below average Experience.

Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5"
Hyper Local,Roy Burmon,03 April 2019,4,"Been here with office colleagues, overall a good place to hangout with a gang. But the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sun.

The food was excellent in taste, The chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and I loved it."
Hyper Local,Mahesh Kumar,03 April 2019,5,The service captain Roshan was very friendly and helpful to order non veg plater mutton curry and chicken Biryani and drinks very good I am very happy thanks Roshan visit again
Hyper Local,Mukesh Chef,03 April 2019,5,Lovely place with decent ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local roshan was really amazing overall ouder dahi kebab chilly paneer super spicy wings really very good thanks roshan will visit again

Hyper Local,Raviteja Chinnu,02 April 2019,1,"The place is good not the staff (untrained), few of the staff behave like we owe them some money and they are doing a favour for us , even though music and ambience are good"
Hyper Local,Vyshnavi Yarlagadda,02 April 2019,1,"We went for a birthday party, we ordered the drinks , the alcohol was very less so I called the bearer, informed about my issue. And guess what he said ‚ÄúApke paise se Bacardi or coke hi milega ‚Äú and drink was for 349, what I paid for that drink!

Although the manager was sweet enough to get me another drink."
Hyper Local,Kumuda Naidu,02 April 2019,4,"Simple and elegant ambience ,
Polite staff ,
Food was really good ,
Especially the non-veg platter must try theme !
Comfortable seating .
They really make the best and must try cocktails, they just enjoy serving their new trials with cocktails , served as complimentary for me when they tried it and the immediate minute it‚Äôs worth an order of it !"
Hyper Local,Hasini,02 April 2019,3,Its a decent place for dinner. Decors and the service is average but the food is good. And the bar is fully loaded with great drinks. And the offers are also very attractive.
Hyper Local,Vineet R,01 April 2019,1,"Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever."
Hyper Local,Rishi Chauhan,01 April 2019,1,I had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place. We were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation (it separates balcony from the bar). We told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing. You don't have to worry about anything. Till that time we had ordered our food. But seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out.
Hyper Local,Parijat Ray,31 March 2019,4,"We have ordered Mutton Galouti, Chholey calzone, Pesto roast vegetables pizza and Penne arrabiata (chicken). The detailed review are as follows:
Mutton Galouti: Enriched with spices, made up of succulent meat. Don't try if you don't like spicy food.
Chholey calzone: A treat to the taste buds. Kulcha pockets filled with chholey.
Pesto roast vegetables pizza: A thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppings.
Penne arrabiata ( chicken added separately ): Nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chicken.
Nice ambience and satisfactory service."

Location 4/5."
Hyper Local,Abhishek Kumar,27 March 2019,1,"Crap food, less varities, and no drinks in buffets. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all. Not recommended at all."
Hyper Local,Koushal Koshik,26 March 2019,5,"Had a great time dining at hyper local. The Non-veg platter, chicken tikka and Assorted wings,were very tasty all food.. Our server for the day, Nitish Kumar was very prompt and friendly."
Hyper Local,Varun Chandrasekharan,25 March 2019,2,"One of the worst restaurants in Hyderabad. Very bad service and they didn‚Äôt have most of the things that they specified on their menu card. Took friend for lunch there thinking to have good time, but was one of the worst times."
Hyper Local,Shreshth Malhotra,25 March 2019,3,"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)"
Hyper Local,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,25 March 2019,3,"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.
Recommended!!!"
Hyper Local,Dian Shmilev,24 March 2019,1,I tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well. The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak Hindi. Of course we left immediately and don‚Äôt think that will ever come back.
Hyper Local,Sanjeevani Srivastava,24 March 2019,4,I went there two times both for lunch.. first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit. But overall nice place and a must visit
Hyper Local,Anshul Jain,23 March 2019,3,"Situated at the top floor of SLN terminus along with food court area.
Ambience and decor is pleasing.
Buffet doesn't do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service. We had to wait for bowls, spoons and refill of chutney etc.
They serve one veg soup, 2 veg starter, Live pasta which was also not upto the mark, 3 curry, Rice,biryani and different bread option. Gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert."

I feel the good options can be increased, overall good experience."

Cream Stone,Bhargav Addepalli,30 April 2019,5,Just because of a silly reason your customer care executives are talking about rules and ruthlessly saying customer has to bear the costs for uber mistake.

Taste: 5/5
Service: 5/5"

They have added more anjeer rather than other dry fruits.Really I didn't feel like I am eating ice cream because of anjeer. I never going to order ice cream from cream stone. People who wants ice cream taste don't go for cream stone dry fruit, nuts overloaded and Afghan ice cream.price also not reasonable."

After assuring the order will be ready in sometime, there was no update."
Cream Stone,Shivali Kamath,02 March 2019,2,"I did not have a good experience here. The service wasn't good. The ice cream looked good, but I didn't like the taste. Too many nuts. The listing in the menu was a bit misleading, and didn't have anything mentioned about nuts."
Cream Stone,Get Spoiled,01 March 2019,5,"Great taste, Nice quality, Affordable prices, Effective varities, plus Zomato on time delivery. I order here almost daily. Only problem with this place is Caution : you will get addicted for sure."
Cream Stone,Swathi Siri,01 March 2019,5,If you are an ice-cream lover you might have already been here. Cream stone is one of the best places to get many variety flavoured ice-creams at anytime.
Cream Stone,Priya ‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞Ø‡∞æ,26 February 2019,1,"I am wondering if I had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet I gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. Despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely."
Cream Stone,Gogineni Shashikanth,23 February 2019,3,"The quality is good,
But found hair in my order which is not good , please be sure the food is good while delivering it !!!!!
Hope it would be better next time !!"
Cream Stone,Subhendu Khan,22 February 2019,5,"I used to crave for the place before I visit, and now it seems the waiting was worthy. In each bite I can feel the delicacy. But we had full stomach when we ordered fruit overloaded and chocolava. But I would suggest for one for two people."
Cream Stone,Indradipta Sardar,11 February 2019,5,Awesome ice cream shop. Had waffle nutcracker and lichi lake. Would recommend to all. Taste was good and quite budget friendly. Try out magic pops if you have not tried before.
Cream Stone,Atul Kumar Sinha,10 February 2019,4,"Though busy but an awesome place to hang out. Grab some delicious combinations of chocolate & Nutty ice-creams, shakes, waffles and you could probably have the best ice-creams to satisfy your cravings."
Cream Stone,Infitree Tech,09 February 2019,5,"One of my favourite cream stone. Loved the taste with brownie ""Chocovala"". I was completely satisfied with the Chocovala . I will suggest this to my friends, they can also enjoy this same feeling."

We enjoyed our night at cream stone and it was really good time with my friend at cream stone."
Cream Stone,Sowmya Valentina,03 February 2019,1,Look at the quantity of icecream charging 175 and the product should be worth to it right ......and the brownie is not at all backed its completed rock chilled
Cream Stone,Vaishakhi R Kamath,02 February 2019,5,"I am a huge fan of Cream Stone's Death by Chocolate ice cream. I've never personally been there, and I always got it delivered.
The packing is always so amazing. It's one box of chocolate cake with loaded chocolate sauce and another box that has a mix of vanilla and chocolate ice cream.
It's a must try for all the chocolate lovers out there."
Cream Stone,Uday Manem,31 January 2019,3,Cool place which will be available till 1pm in HYD beat icreams and very unique especially they have wide range of varieties in chocolate types and service is also quite good except their GM singing in the outlet :p

From packing, delivering to food taste, everything is fine....
My first order after reaching Hyderabad!!"
Cream Stone,Lamha,25 January 2019,4,"Visited this place a while back. Their ice creams are totally worth it! I'd suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one: the pre-listed choices are just so much better. the only issue is their seating space is a little less, so we took our ice creams to go. But would recommend it just for the taste."
Cream Stone,Saurabh Sanyal,21 January 2019,5,"I had Dry Fruit Overload ice cream from this outlet. It was the most amazing experience I had on that day. If I have to order an ice cream again, I will surely choose Cream Stone again. Damn, it was so amazing! I am out of words right now."
Cream Stone,Nillu,16 January 2019,4,Interior is good but small one and quality of ice cream also good but some of the items like chocolate u can't eat alone bcz of it Sweetness
Cream Stone,Pradeep Reddy,13 January 2019,1,I am not happy the way it is managed. No proper response from the workers. My order was not yet prepared and these people are not ready to replace my 1 order out of 10+ items which I have orders . These people are not working for customer satisfaction. They are working for only money. Not at all happy this time.
Cream Stone,Samreen Rizvi,12 January 2019,5,The more you have the more you crave. One of the best icecream concepts ever. The way they serve icecream blended in the taste itself is just awesome
Cream Stone,Stephen Reji,06 January 2019,5,I had gone to this place and ordered nutty overload icecream and chocolate icecream with waffles. The nutty overload icecream was really good.
Cream Stone,Swastik Kaushal,06 January 2019,5,"Ordered Nuts Overloaded. Tasted like nothing you could have ever tasted. With every bite of the ice-cream, you get loads of nut in your mouth.
Cream Stone has variety of self made ice creams which will make you feel special.(Ye Maine kuch bhi likh diya, couldn't think of what to write.)"

Cream Stone,Namit Agarwal,30 December 2018,5,"Cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert. They have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams. They have Shakes, Waffles, ice creams, sundaes and what not.

The ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples.

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

Must try if you have a sweet tooth!!!"
Cream Stone,Alisha,27 December 2018,1,"Ordered Fruit exotica and fruit and nuts ice-cream on two different days, once from swiggy and once from zomato. The ice-creams were both melted and lacked the flavour and quality that is usually offered by cream stone. Highy DISAPPOINTED!! I was a fan of cream stone ice-creams but I won't recommend this to anyone ever again. Not worth spending money on."
Cream Stone,Sidthefoodie,25 December 2018,5,"A must try for all the ice cream lover.

Cream Stone,Shalini Pilli,20 December 2018,4,"One busy place especially in the evenings.
Cream stone has created a special place for itself since beginning. All the ice creams are tasty and the mix ins.

Wide range of ice creams , cream blends, home made waffle bowls and cones makes it unique.

My personal fav are alphonso Mango icecream, death by chocolate and brownie break.

One good stop for ice cream lovers"

Cream Stone,Himanshi Mishra,08 December 2018,5,Best place for ice cream in the area. The ambience is also nice. The nutty concepts range of ice cream is a must try. The rates are higher but the quality is good.

Death by Chocolate, Chocolate Overdose and Karamel Sutra. When I am on a diet, I get their diet fruit concept icecream- I am that mad about their icecreams. This is one of those places where I gawk on my food and forget to click pictures."
Cream Stone,Yashwant Darsi,13 November 2018,3.5,It's too crowded with delivery executives all the time.. Don't find place to sit mostly. It'd be better if they provide some way out. Preferable to online order than physical visit.
Cream Stone,Yagnahaun Jonnadula,11 November 2018,5,"Cream stone is always best but even when the cake that we require is completed they are still showing the cake on online delivery,it can be changed so that customers don't face any trouble"
Cream Stone,Ramona Sinha,10 November 2018,5,"Whenever i have a craving for ice creams, cream stone is the solution! I am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is Coffee craze. The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose. It's a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie. The icecreams are extremely rich and intense. Overall, i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours."
Cream Stone,Himabindu Reddy,06 November 2018,1,"I could not finish ice cream at all. Not at all good.

Cream Stone,Charushila Biswas,03 November 2018,2,"Ordered nutella brownie and got brownie and vanilla ice cream It's a shame that they write the name of the ice cream correct, take the money correct but FAIL TO MAKE the ice cream correct.

The place is very small for indoor seating. I think , the management should increase their indoor seating arrangement due to their large crowd.

If u r a icecream-lover , this place will be the perfect bliss for you."
Cream Stone,Chandra Sekar,23 October 2018,5,A perfect dessert for you and a must have surprise gift for your partner üòç Try the Chocolate over dose and enjoy the pure bliss of Chocolate in your mouth üòã can reduce the sugar content a bit ü§î

Sardarji's Chaats & More,_ Gluttonous Hedonist,23 May 2019,3,"The food is economically reasonable. The North Indian dishes including chole kulche, chole bhature and paneer butter masala are comparatively better than the chaats."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Minocher Hansotia,18 May 2019,5,"Oh ho this place serves amazing parathas and their combos are worth it.. You experience it to appreciate it. Lot of crowd at meal times, so u might have to wait 15-20 min for your parantha to be made. But worth the wait.They have a small seating area inside too."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Gautam Narang,06 May 2019,4,"Today I was very hungry as I had to skip my breakfast due to the workload. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt want to spend more than a hundred bucks on the brunch. This was the only restaurant on my mind. You can order a Paratha soaked in Butter with Raita, Chutney and Onions. It is heavenly; all for less than 100!"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Tahishi Gupta,03 May 2019,5,Ordered vada pav and pav bhaji. They had a variety of chats . Both the dishes were too delicious. A good snacks joint in Hyderabad. Their dahi papri should top your list.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Rishi Kumar,27 April 2019,1,"Order rajma in 200 rupees. Taste is not that good. and quantity is too less as per charges.

Too too much spicy, was not able to eat it without water.

If you cant cook properly better dont sell it."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Raghavendra Deeduvanu,25 April 2019,3,"Their gol gappa is a must try. It is different from what we get in Hyderabad. Chole bhature was also good. Ignore the attitude of the staff, especially the one at the counter."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pallavi Mitra,16 April 2019,5,Aloo onion paratha was awesome delicacy to have . Sardarji tussi great ho !! Mouth watering. Would love of you provide some more at cheaper price. Lassi is awesome as well thank you paji
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Clifford,16 April 2019,1,Been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and I bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they don‚Äôt even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of ‚ÄúNorth Indian Food‚Äù instead search for another joints in Madhapur or Gachibowli like ‚ÄúParathas and more‚Äù or ‚Äújust paratha‚Äù there you will get the real authentic food.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Manisha Mani,14 April 2019,1,Dropped down my expectations. Ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat. That tasted sweet. I regret ordering.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Dristy Debanjana Panda,05 April 2019,4,I ordered dahi bhalla papdi chaat and this is how they packed. They should pack it in a plastic box. The dahi was spilled over the polythene and hardly 20% of the dahi was left in the container. I paid money for nothing. They should give my money back for it.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sanjay Yadav,01 April 2019,3,I have been visiting/ordering from this place for over 2 years now. Chaats here used to be amazing but the quality these days has gone down.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,The Foodie Bookworm,01 April 2019,4,"I love the gol gappe here, At Hyderabad the gol gappe are different they add dal in it where as I am used to masala aloo filling. And they provide it best in Gachibowli."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shalu Singh,31 March 2019,4,"If you are craving for a chaat you must visit this place. I tried karara palak chaat, dahi poori and paani poori. Its not as good as we have it in north but definitely a must try."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Richa,29 March 2019,5,"I ordered Aloo methi paratha and I'm it was awesome just feel lik I'm eating ghar ka khana its yummyüòçüòç
Previously also I have ordered from this restaurant and the food is so good. I think people should go there and have food its really goodüëçüòáüòáüòá"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sonali Joshi,29 March 2019,5,"The food is delicious from this place. Very meticulous packaging. I've tried pav bhaji, chole bhature, and almost all the snacks the place has to offer. Reasonable prices and good food quality. I'd definitely recommend this place to try for various chaats and snacks."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Khushboo Pandey,24 March 2019,4,"I had food from this place many times. I was glad when I found north indian chat in hyderabad. Its not that good as we can have in north but still a good chat place as compared to others (whatever I know).
Quanity:5/5
Quality: 4/5
Packaging : 5/5
Delivery 5/5"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Venkat Mahesh,24 March 2019,4,"Lods of Lods of Lods of Food..!

Are you veg. lover, then it will be like paradise for you. They server many varities of Kulcha, Paratha, Vada pav, Sand wich  & Chats. Loved Aloo kulcha and Dal makhani like hell. Paratha and Vada pav are yummy. We have Mixed Veg Paratha and the taste was good with many veggies in it. Vada pav was considerable (nothing can beat Mumbai's vada pav). Had Lemon juice but didn't like that, we have opted for this as there is no Lassi point in time. Over all good food with good price."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shikha,20 March 2019,5,good delivery
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Vipul (Coffee Lover),14 March 2019,2,Have been eating in Sardarji's from a long time but now I feel they have lost the taste in their food. Nothing is good not even chat. Will have to look out for another option in Hyderabad for good chat.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Ritika Shrivastava,14 March 2019,4,"Amazing chaat and street food just like back in North. The taste and hygiene is awesome, which is why this place is in my list when it comes to street food. Their chats are delicious. I'd ordered pav bhaji, sev puri and vada pav. All was yummy, will recommend this place to anyone who is fond of North Indian food."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shalini Mukherjee,14 March 2019,4,"Sardaarji's Chaats & More serves really good punjabi food. If you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food, this place is a really good option in and around Gachibowli. As the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.

I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.
The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

Since, I never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! But overall, the experience was good."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Theavantgard,12 March 2019,1,"In plain simple words overhyped. Very greasy and oily and bland taste. Order chole bhatire, mix veg kulcha, daal makhani and aloo tikki. Everything was very poor in taste. Better to put some effort and visit Bikanerwala in jubilee hills."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Mudit Kejriwal,10 March 2019,3,"Not the place if you belong to northern India. No doubt, the hygiene is well maintained but food is not as delicious as I expected it to be. Service is quick though. Also they dishes are quite overpriced."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Swati Tiwari,09 March 2019,5,world class tasty
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Naveena Sombhatla,09 March 2019,1,"Maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones. Ordered aloo paratha... First of all quality of the food is bad. Bad odour from raita and then instead of sending pickle, they sent something where I can only see mirchis but no pickle."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Tejas Lad,03 March 2019,5,"The chaat that this restaurant offers is amazing and never ate such delicious sev-puri ever in Hyderabad.. amazing taste, satisfying quantity... Chaat lovers must try ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Gondi Kavinder Reddy,01 March 2019,5,"Went two three times after that decided to give the rating 5. 
What ever the item I consumed are very tasty. Like paneerbutter masala, aloo paratha, paneer kulhca, samosa ragada, chole batura. Not enough place, packed with people, still delivering the orders in time is good. Overall you can visit this place."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Cadeepthichowdary.raavi,26 February 2019,4,"Its simply awesome ... one of the best places in gachibowli to have proper delicious authentic north indian chat items... the real chat palace... i don‚Äôt think anyone would get disappointed with the food here ...

Nice place to go in the evenings and have something tasty like kachori, pav baji , dahipuri , vada pav etc etc ... i would highly recommend everyone to taste food here üëç"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),22 February 2019,5,"It was too good. We ordered bhelpuri, dahi papri and aloo tikki with chutney. I must admit three of them were equally good. The dahi papri was sweet n tangy,, bhelpuri was well balanced with spices and lot of shev and finally aloo tikki with dhaniya chutyney was tangy and spicy in a balanced way .With well balanced spices and awesome taste this place stole my heart.

atoneplaceonline.com"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Foodie On Wheels...,18 February 2019,4,"We tried aloo tikki with dahi. Although it was not bad, but it was not like authentic Delhi side aloo tikki.
I will definitely try other dishes here."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Rahil Nyk,15 February 2019,4,"Yesterday I ordered chole bhature and tawa butter pav bhaji. Chole were lip smacking. It's a must try for all. Pav bhaji was a bit of disappointment. The quantity of bhaji was less and taste was just average. That's why I deducted 1 star. But, chole !!! Definitely deserves the rest 4 stars :-)"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Chaitanyabankuru02,10 February 2019,1,"Food had no flavour , doesn't have any flavour of authentic punjabi food food is too plain..would not recommend this even as last resort ... Try to"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Gurpreet Singh,10 February 2019,4,The food is great but they can improve on the ambience. Especially liked the golgappe and chaat. Though ordering food online was not a great experience. Once I recieved incomplete order while other time packaging of chaat wasn't great.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Suraj Shenoy,09 February 2019,4,I had tried the paneer kulcha combo and aloo tikki. It was delicious and their chole is the best. Price is very reasonable and delivery is also good.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sri Bhavya,09 February 2019,3,"Ordered paav bhaji chole bhature and papdi chat!
But they forgot to deliver the chat!I was a bit disappointed by that.But the taste was good."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sumit Sharma,02 February 2019,3,"I ordered paneer butter masala, paneer quality is best but gravy is not tasty."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Yashasvi Rao,31 January 2019,4,missing cutlery
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Khana With NA,31 January 2019,4,"I ordered Paneer Butter Masala with one Butter Naan and Lachha Paratha And my all-time favorite Punjabi Chole Bhature.

Chole Bhature was yummy. Paneer Butter Masala was not that great in comparison of Chole Bhature."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pavan Rishit Meka,27 January 2019,4,"This restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food. It is located in Indra Nagar, Gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in Hyderabad. This place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained.

We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.

If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable. For the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Amit Chaurasia,26 January 2019,5,"Delivery by Zomato by quick! They have removed Sandwiches from their menu. Some of the food items are priced high. Overall good experience.
Chole Bhatoore (5/5)

Chole Bhatoore were amazing. Do eat those bhatoore at the outlet itself."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Namit Agarwal,22 January 2019,4,"Sardarji's gives you a feel of North Indian chat and Chole bhatoore outlets. They have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chat,pav bhaji,chole bhatoore on high tables.

I recently visited Sardarji's and tried lot of items of it

Gol Gappe (3.5/5)
Gol gappes were good but the Paani can be made more tangy.They only have one varieties of Paani,and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it.

Aloo Tikki (4/5)
Aloo Tikki was very good. Red and green chutneys were perfect.

Samosa (4/5)

Chole Bhatoore (5/5)
Chole Bhatoore were amazing.Do eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at home.Choles are also very tasty.

Looking forward to try more of their items.Their Naan size was huge and other items looked very tempting.

Must visit place if you want to enjoy some tasty chat,chole Bhatoore and that too at a very affordable price."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Komal Pahuja,15 January 2019,1,Taste not good as expected. Ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy. Taste not good as expected. Ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pramod Kumar,14 January 2019,1,"Chat section is awful...very bad

Ordered aloo tikki chat...dahi tikki chat...and papdi chat.....got messy papdi and spoild food.

Taste was very bad...shitty

It was like cheating...a customer who paid u.."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Foodieyo,12 January 2019,4,Food here is decent for the price paid. Paneer paratha was awesome and huge. Could easily fulfill even when one is very hungry. Tried others like paneer butter masala didn‚Äôt like it that much.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Yashasvi Rao,10 January 2019,2,"no cutlery, no seal on the box, poor packing."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sachinagarwal1995,05 January 2019,4,"A very good chaat and snacks stop, reminds me of north Indian street chaats taste, and am a regular customer here now, especially of papadi chaat, worth a try and you will love it üëç"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Manoj Muppasani,05 January 2019,2,"I have been here many times. I like the food. But never order food online you'll get very cold food( inspite of instructions) to name a few samosa's, veg biryani! etc.. you'll definitely regret."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Gaurav Kumar,01 January 2019,3,"Sardarji's chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over (for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi).

The sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. 
However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked. This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Rahul Dogra,01 January 2019,5,Better to take away or ask for delivery. Cost is fine but the taste is the specialty. North Indians can find their taste and dishes being rediscovered here.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Saurabh,01 January 2019,5,"The perfect north food with perfect Punjabi taste. From the chaat to bhature. All the items are good. If you are looking for North-Punjabi dish, Order. You'll love it."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Swati Swapna Nayak,29 December 2018,1,Testless food.nan are almost burnt.don't like the food at all.the paneer butter masala tests like sumber.they have send tadka in place of dal makhni.totally wastage of money.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Vikashtiwary1991,29 December 2018,5,Awesome food . I tried chat and samosa and it is one of the best in Hyderabad. Must try and zomato provide the facility to order online which adds to your likings
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Vicky,21 December 2018,1,I received wrong order..i tried to contact with restaurant but they didn‚Äôt received the call...this is the worst experience ever i ordered online
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pavan,19 December 2018,5,Excellent taste
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Inner World Of A Super Foodie,18 December 2018,3,"I went to the Himagiri Hospital and when I came out of there I really felt hungry, and so my sister suggested that we should go to this place as this place serves excellent Punjabi Food... I ordered Chole Bature and lassi... Trust me the type of lassi which I had over there, I had exactly that kind only in Punjab and nowhere else... The Chole Bature too was delicious...
But I didn't like the ambiance... Just try to work on that... Otherwise Everything is upto the mark...

Ambiance-2.5/5
Food-5/5
Service-3.5/5"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Ashita Agarwal,18 December 2018,4,If you are from north and you miss its chat then this place is a must visit for all chat lovers. They have tastiest samosa chat and bhel puri and their pani puri is so so amazing.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Suraj,13 December 2018,1,We ordered samsa chola kulcha chola and sandwichs The taste quality is too much low I did not eat this type of quality food from different restaurant...worst taste and worst quality I ever had .....
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Abhishek Singh,11 December 2018,5,This the the beat place to have real #punjabi food. The taste and aroma of delicious food is juat mouth watering. You will not regret any single time to eat here.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Atul Kumar Kushwaha,10 December 2018,5,"Nice taste of north indian chaat, rahi bhalle and chole bhature. Chole bhature is one of the favourite for us. Most of the time ordered from here specially for that."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shilpi Rani,09 December 2018,1,roti nd nan both u gave me without butter nd i ordered with butter...nd both are burnt. even paneer curry quantity was too less man..no1 can eat a single chapathi with that...nd panner pieces were in burnt condition.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Smriti Sinha,09 December 2018,1,"They will accept your order even if they don't have the items. After 40 mins they say they don't have it and doesnt cancel it. And Delivery boy will also mark your order as delivered. In short words , go for dine in or choose different good apps to order ."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,RAHUL DEY,07 December 2018,1,"Too bad service, does not accept the Order multiple times & does not receive Calls too. And the best part, they cancel the Orders after money gets deducted. Very bad experience, I mean WORST Experience."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Projwal Tiwari,06 December 2018,4,Really good with the taste and the quality!! Pocket friendly and worth giving a try!! Dal makhani with rice is what I would recommend to try!!
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Princy Singh Rajput,02 December 2018,2,"I have been to this place after six months. I have tried chaat and aloo Naan with daal makhni but all tasted average.
There is some serious issue with the person sitting at cash counter. He was very unprofessional with customers."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Tejas Rajput,29 November 2018,3,packing is not good
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sunil Toshniwal,15 November 2018,1,no spoon ... no tissues
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Kalyan Madduru,14 November 2018,3,"Located in Indira nagar, This outlet serves chats along with limited tandoor and Punjabi style main course dishes. Ordered paneer butter masala half along with rumali roti and butter naan. Prices were reasonable and pocket friendly. Less than 200 bucks AI.

Paneer butter masala was extra tangy, unlike traditional restaurant style dishes. Paneer quantity was very less, 4 small pieces served in a cup of smooth textured gravy. Tandoori items tasted good. Ordered earthen pot cooled milk in the end, with chat masala added, 30 bucks per glass."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sneha Gupta,13 November 2018,1,tasteless dal makhani... eating kulcha with it made it tasteless too!
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Jayaram Boyina,13 November 2018,5,excellent delivery
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Bhavi Solanki,04 November 2018,4,"Hyderabad and Good North Indian Food! Was wondering where will I find such good North Indian Food until I landed to this place!

Taste : Ordered chats and Dal Makhani & Alu Kulcha Combo.. Must say such tasty Punjabi food made me very happy!
Service : Good Service!

The counter is busy on Weekends totally!! If you crave for Punjabi Food, this is a MUST VISIT place!!!"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Aman Agarwal,03 November 2018,5,The best vada pav I had in gachibowli. Chaats are just awesome. You will love Alu kulcha with Dal makhani although they should increase the quantity of Dal makhani but overall it's a great place to eat.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Aman Arora,31 October 2018,4,"Ordered via Zomato delivery. Great taste and packaging. However, Portions can be increased a little though. Also dude no onion or green chutney along :("
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Foodie Goodie,22 October 2018,5,"It was the second time i ordered something from here, and both the times food was delicious , first time i ordered for an alloo paratha it was huge in size and wasn't able to eat full , and this time ordered aloo cheese sandwich , it was yummy , loved it , will definitely try some other things from here."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Upendra,22 October 2018,4,"This is something one would definitely like... they serve n number of variety in north indian food. Must try once they will never disappoint you, l bet"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sidharth Singal,19 October 2018,4,one of the better places to go for north Indian style paranthas. Chat is also good not that great though if you want north Indian style. Have been here quite a number of times and always find it crowded. Has never disappointed.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shrish Deshpande,18 October 2018,4,"Had samosa, Pani puri & Kulcha comBo here.
Best food !
Hygiene wise a bit low. Food was far better to ignore all other lows.
Highly recommend!!"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Tushar Vaidya,14 October 2018,1,yesterday there was leakage of water pipe(possibly drainage pipe)at restaurant .... instead of repairing that they are shamelessly kept counter open .... customer had to stand in line while water is leaking beside and at the same time eat beside that water leaking pipeline .... I would suggest first repair pipe line and then open restaurant....... serving in this condition to customers shows no value of customers
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Neeraj Alexander,12 October 2018,1,Ordered bhel puri from this place and I found an ant in while I was eating. These guys are unhygienic and dont take necessary precautions to ensure that they protect the food they prepare from all the insects around the area. Be careful!
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Aparna Wani,11 October 2018,1,"If you dont want to deliver the food then dont accept the orders in the first place and the cancellation call from zomato comes when you expect your food. Be careful while accepting the orders or at least dont make  the hungry people wait even to know about the cancellations 

Giving 1 star bcoz cant rate below that"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shivam,09 October 2018,4,"Punjabi food gets you?Well go there soon then. Their chole bhature and club grilled sandwiches are something which are really amazing even the best joints can't beat.

There's no ambiance or proper sitting but it's worth it!"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pawan Sarswat,08 October 2018,1,"Worst daal makhani, i have ever tasted in my life, kinda weird taste it was.
Minus rating is not there otherwise i would definitely have punched that."

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Deepak Chander,07 October 2018,3,This was very first time in south that i heard alot about northern delicacy Chole bhature... But i would say i am disappointed with the taste as it is nowhere near to what it should be.... And prices are also very high...
Sardarji's Chaats & More,MD Nehal Afroz,06 October 2018,5,Delivery on time
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Akhil Puri,06 October 2018,1,"If there was an option of putting up 0 stars, I wouldn't have hesitated. Look at the kind of food they offer. I had ordered this 'Aloo Kulcha Combo' from this restaurant. A burnt kulcha, and not even a bowlful of Dal was served. The combo mentioned pickle as well, but that wasn't sent either. Despite complaining them with requisite proofs, no action was taken. TERRIBLE!"
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Narasimha Sahu,02 October 2018,1,I order a veg biryani. It was cold when it reached me. The taste was just bland and they had 1/4th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans. Even the cauliflower was not cooked properly. They should just remove the biryani from their menu forever.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Mayank,30 September 2018,1,Had the worst experience ever. Having ordered Paneer Butter Masala and getting Mix Veg paranthas was not at all expected. So guys be prepared if you get a totally different dish than what you order online.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Debajyoti Dash,30 September 2018,3,Again left the salad in the order
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pratap,30 September 2018,3,"Ordered Samosa, aloo Tikki with chutney, papdi dahi bhalla, sev batata puri.
Samosa with chutney was good, liked it
Papdi dahi bhalla was good
Didn't like the taste of sev batata puri,
Did not like aloo Tikki, it was not freshly made , felt like the potato was spoilt
Chole bhatoore was good and pav bhaji was ok.
Didn't like the taste of Bhel Puri."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Amrita Sahoo,27 September 2018,4,"ordered Sev Batata Puri, Mumbai Vada Pav, Mumbai Samosa Pav, Samosa Cheese Grilled Sandwich and Veg Club Grilled Sandwich....taste was good....not spicy as preferred.......only disappointed with the packaging"

After staying in Delhi for 3 years, I was looking for a chatwala in Hyderabad. Here I found the chatwala now. The taste can be improved, but something is better than nothing."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Anjali Roy,23 September 2018,4,If you crave for some Mumbai style chaat then this modest place is for you. Absoultely pocket and taste bud friendly. I would definitely recommend this for a casual snack time. Yet to try the main course here.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Amit,22 September 2018,5,very impressive delivery. Amazing work
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shanti Priya Gogoi,20 September 2018,3,Chole was too oily..
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Rishabh Wahi,17 September 2018,4,"Great place to have good chat. Very well made dahi papdi and aalu tikki, especially because their dahi tastes very fresh and feels like home made. Only order one full paratha for yourself if you're extremely hungry, though the filling is great but it is very heavy."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Varun Reddy,16 September 2018,2,"Heard a lot about this small food joint and the north indian stuff they make. Should say I‚Äôm disappointed, looks like the quality is not the same as before, even the price is a bit high compared to other places with similar taste."
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Diki Lama,16 September 2018,5,Got the chole bhature for ‚Çπ 66 only through FAV50. Was craving for some good old punjabi flavour and this was perfect.
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Debajyoti Dash,16 September 2018,3,have only one packet of curry instead of 2
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Aditi Saxena,14 September 2018,5,great good!!
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Charu Gupta,14 September 2018,2,They have reduced the quantity a lot!!!!!

#Reviewmode

Bbbq nation has come up with all new DAWAT -E - RAMADAN Where they've bought in few of the best Street foods of Ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soul's!

I was pretty excited to try out their Ramadan special menu and the moment I enter I see a Big Raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot Mutton Chops searing on ghee! That view Enticed me and I just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. I couldn't wait to try that Super appetising Chops and delicious Raan!

Besides they also got chicken Shawarma and MUTTON HALEEM Which is another different delicacy storyline...
I had to take a big bowl of Haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and Final touch with Two spoons of Ghee. Yes that's my style! üòâ

I walked to see few more exciting dishes and I found the legendary Badami Gosht! Yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides Murgh Mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...

Cannot miss Thier Gosht Biryani üòã one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. Perfectly tender meat and soft and Fragrant basmati with a touch of Ghee!

Only because of the taste and being foodie I had two rounds of everything and was full...
But there's always a another stomach for kulfi!
Pan-Pista-malai, Voila!"
Barbeque Nation,Ananthulaprudhvidhar,19 May 2019,4,"This is one of my favourite restaurant with grill concept. Ambience was really fascinating ,food quality was too good , my favourite recipe is grill pineapple it is delicious."
Barbeque Nation,Vinay Srivastava,05 May 2019,4,"Have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013. Have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.
This Gachibowli BBQ Nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn‚Äôt available in any other location I have been to.
The staff is extremely courteous. We were served by Rajib, who was really warm, quick in his service.
The overall quality of the food was satisfying, just like most of the other outlets I‚Äôve been to."
Barbeque Nation,Gourmet Hunter,04 May 2019,5,"As usual it's fab place to have grill in a buffet. Non veg is awesome here. Chicken, Mutton, Prawns, Fish are served on the grill. Some days you also get crab curry. Now they opened tawa starters as well.

Nice place to go for team lunch/dinner."
Barbeque Nation,The Food O‚ÄôClock,03 May 2019,2,"Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.

Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.

AC facility was good, very cold.

But I don‚Äôt recommend this place."
Barbeque Nation,Sahithi Anchuri,27 April 2019,5,"This is an amazing place for Veg as well as Non Veg starters. There are so many varieties in it. As you will be already full, you don't generally go for Main course and also it's very average. I really love their service. Suppose you don't like item, they will replace it by customising according to your requirement."
Barbeque Nation,Dashrat,27 April 2019,5,Service was excellent biriyani and service excellent very nice food very good staff and servise drinks was excellentb.bq chiken very test and fish pine apple very test service and food quality is excellent
Barbeque Nation,Sandeep Srivastava,21 April 2019,5,Was wife's birthday and our anniversary as well.. Naresh and Bipul made it point to make it extra special. The hospitality and the culture of the employees keeps taking me back there forever..
Barbeque Nation,Pritha Chatterjee,14 April 2019,5,"This place always exceeds expectations!!! Friendly staff, customised orders and finger licking good food!!! And of course you need a second stomach for the desserts!!!"
Barbeque Nation,Raja Gopal Reddy Chereddy,09 April 2019,5,"It's Barbi boss...no comments.
It's was sudden plan from Gang to visit this place, fortunately that day was 10 years celebrations day of BN.
We got some discount on bill also. We all from coastal area basically and sea food lovers.
Believe me or not, I loved and felt happy wit prawns here...yummy and yummy.
It might silly...we did justice to my money, may more also.
That was a weekday and I want to try this place on some weekend"
Barbeque Nation,M.shravan Chowdary,07 April 2019,5,"Had to wait a bit to get a table that's a good thing üòÑ, great food and best service such a great staff Sudeep Roy, Naresh ur a star I have seen him doing everything keep up the good work guys"
Barbeque Nation,Anirudh Bhattacharjee,29 March 2019,3,"I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together."
Barbeque Nation,Riyaz Ahmed,23 March 2019,1,"Had a worst experience today at BarbQ Nation , gachhibowli, hyderabad

Taste is not as good as remaining branches. Non veg items seem to be frozen few days back then coocked, feels like a was while eating"
Barbeque Nation,Vikas Jain,20 March 2019,1,"This is the worst barbeque , i have ever seen in my life. Barbeque for name sake. No barbeque item like paneer, fish was baked properly. waste of money"
Barbeque Nation,Phaneendra,03 March 2019,4,"We went to this place as a part of corporate outing. It was my first time to Barbeque Nation. I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies."
Barbeque Nation,Chhaya Sharma,23 February 2019,4,"Barbeque is mostly my favorite but if I compare barbeque nation with Abs , sahib's barbeque... obviously I have to give one point less to this one...food is good but limited items..but if you have kid go there my son and my friend's kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french fries...they enjoyed to the core... ambience is gud service excellent...

Food 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Service 5/5"
Barbeque Nation,Aarunvalissha,23 February 2019,5,"This Place was really amazing, as usual the staff is very polite, Appreciate their work in maintaining professionalism, loved being serviced by Saif Ali Khan and staff.."
Barbeque Nation,Mario Fonseca,21 February 2019,4,Been to the place recently. The service was on a slower side strangely but the food items on the grills taking a little longer to arrived. Food good as usual
Barbeque Nation,Abhishek Gupta,08 February 2019,3,"Friday afternoon, We planned team lunch (veg & non-veg) in Gachibowli Barbecue Nation. We were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.

In short, it wasn't value for money. 

I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy."
Barbeque Nation,Siddik Khan,07 February 2019,5,Inside Atmosphere is good....and serving and way of treating everything I loved it.....and very reasonable price for parties..we can enjoy with friends....
Barbeque Nation,Vasu Taneja,04 February 2019,4,"A well-known place to have buffet

Barbeque Nation,Vamsi P,02 February 2019,4,"Located in the heart of Financial district it is very convenient place to visit on a weekday with colleagues. Their service was simply superb, they tried to understand the requirement of the customer‚Äôs on each and every table and customized the spice level etc., based on the request. Had good number of options in Veg as well. Over all food was very good, service was exceptional."
Barbeque Nation,Kaveri Saicharan,31 January 2019,5,Kirak Bole tho kirak Hyderabadi language just loved it had a nice time enjoyed the food mainly pan Kulfi loved iiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttt
Barbeque Nation,Ankita Kumari,31 January 2019,5,"The staffs at BBQ Gachibowli are very good. From start to End they took care ,which dish is good,any modifications needed.
Food was very tasty(starter+Main course)
You can try Fish Finger(chefs special) made on Request."
Barbeque Nation,Avinash Cena,28 January 2019,5,"friendly service
The restaurant ambience is good
The food tastes good
And they need to increase the desserts
And jst increase the items
Awesome finally"
Barbeque Nation,Yankeedba,27 January 2019,5,"Been many times here and the place is not crouded during dinner time, the best time to visit this place is during dinner time only as lunch time too much crouded with office guys specially Mon to Fri, coming to food , prawns and fish starters are too too good , other kebabs also too good, staff is too good in service and they treat us like kings and queens, I strongly recommend Gachibowli branch as less crowded during dinner and weekens"
Barbeque Nation,Phaneendra Ch,24 January 2019,5,"The taste of increase when its BBQ,its taste doubled when is comes to Barbeque Nation ..Service is more jet sped..food was excellent..need little improvement in ambiance"
Barbeque Nation,Food Junkie,24 January 2019,4,"Waiters butter customers more than the kebabs üòÇ, jokes apart the service is too good and they do have a decent range of items, eventhough they lack in terms of number of items but it's compensated with the quality level. The place feels a bit cramped up bt got a good vibe to it. Definitely would visit again."
Barbeque Nation,Imran Asghar,21 January 2019,5,"Awesome place, Awesome food, lovely staff (Azaad Hussain) was tremendous at his work one of the most polite guy I ever see in any restaurant"
Barbeque Nation,Syril Thomas,13 January 2019,4,This place is good when you come empty stomach... Just kidding . Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. Has a lag in my order when I had been there last time but I guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine. A very good place with very welcoming staff.
Barbeque Nation,Gautam,11 January 2019,5,Went yesterday to bbq. Wonderful service. Special thanks to Roy who took care of us.he kept checking if everything was fine or need to customize anything. Food was yummy. Became a big fan of bbq. Good going guys!!!!
Barbeque Nation,Purnima Powell,26 December 2018,4,"Early Christmas celebrations. we were dressed up and wanted fine dine. We were told that Barbeque Nation is always booked, we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 9:30.
From the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...I must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.
The Starters were amazing....I love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
But their Prawns are the best grilled prawns I ever tasted. They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course.... My personal favs were Grilled Prawns and RoseMary Chicken...mmm..  mmm... mmmmm yummy !!!! 

Thank you so much for your excellent service and Great Food..Hope to visit you guys soon..!!!"
Barbeque Nation,Sreejith Sreekumaran,24 December 2018,3,Who doesn't like BBQ and having it from BBQ Nations is a good experience. Chicken tikka nadi fish are really tasty. As part of new year celebration there were some new dishes which was passable. Expected better in desserts
Barbeque Nation,Beeshwamohan,18 December 2018,5,"We have been having a grand time whenever we visit Barbeque Nation Gachiwoli.. Be it the food, the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs, this place is a must visit.. the staffs here treat you as a part of family and serve you till you get the utmost satisfaction on the taste and quantity of the food.
I would specially like to mention about Mr Naresh from BBQ nation Gachiwoli. The way he treats and welcomes you will make you visit this place all over again and again.. He takes care of you from giving you the best seats available to the best of the food you can have. I give him and this place 5 bright stars.."
Barbeque Nation,Sthiti Chakraborty,17 December 2018,4,"Food: 4.5
Ambiance : good enough
Service : the staff were all very polite but a bit slow

The taste of food was very good. They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. Over all the experience was very good.

Would want to visit againüòä"
Barbeque Nation,Pavani Rajyam,16 December 2018,3,It used to be one of my favourite places and the destination for all family celebrations. However over the time I feel it has lost that touch. There is no more aawww feeling when u eat at this place. They don‚Äôt compromise on the quality of food but I was disappointed with the taste. We tried at both forum mall and gachibowli branches and it felt the same.
Barbeque Nation,Kiran,16 December 2018,4,Been here with friends on a weekday for dinner and this place never fails to meet expectations...be it any outlet. The food is great...the staff was friendly. Only one negative with this outlet is space...it is extremely congested...the tables are too closely placed...hardly any proper aisle space for guests to walk!
Barbeque Nation,Ajay Singh,15 December 2018,5,"Great staff always ready to serve with smile, celebrated our anniversary over there got exceptional service by Ravi, Kumud and Chef. Always take care of our spice level... Love to visit again and again........"
Barbeque Nation,Nishanth Kumar N,13 December 2018,5,"Very much satisfied with the food and service. They had customised kulfi with different types of toppings and it's really good. The non-veg starters are served with normal spice levels and are tasty. If you like spicy food, ask for Tandoori chicken with extra spices. You will love it."
Barbeque Nation,ATUL KUMAR SINHA,12 December 2018,5,Had been there twice. Everytime had a wonderfyl experience. Good ambience and very friendly staffs. The chef himself turn to us asking for any special items to be ordered. Great service.
Barbeque Nation,Hanisha N,06 December 2018,5,"Food:
I had the Non Veg buffet.I loved the starters and the desserts.I personally like their Kulfies the most.

Everything else:
I have been to this branch twice. Service is really good.I had a great experience. Its the best barbeque restaurant I have been to.

Will I go again? Definitely!"
Barbeque Nation,Sidhant Girglani,29 November 2018,1,"We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad."
Barbeque Nation,Siddhartha,27 November 2018,5,"The best restaurant we have been to, till date.
Awesome food and great service. The hospitality shown at the restaurant each and every time that we have visited is at the peaks compared to other restaurants. we treat this restaurant as a family restaurant and make sure we visit this once a month. Never disappointed us in any aspect..
not even once.."
Barbeque Nation,Keerthi M,24 November 2018,3,We went to barbeque nations for thanks giving special day team lunch.Items are good. But service is very slow. We waited for long time for food items after ordered.Deserts and starters are nice.
Barbeque Nation,Sree `,23 November 2018,1,Good place for team lunch but has pathetic veg starters option(potato and mashroom) but they tell will smile that this is all for today .I am writing this review whole I am in the restraint itself.improve Barbeque..every customer is important.
Barbeque Nation,Asad Ullah Khan,22 November 2018,5,"For ravi , he is friendly. Politely answering to questions. Good in taste yeah it's very good everything is fine and the kulfi you don't believe me"
Barbeque Nation,Moumita Panda,18 November 2018,5,Extremely courteous staff & great service...Special mention to Kumud Barman for his exemplary service...keep up the good work guys üëç..Good job
Barbeque Nation,Amar Nath Tiwari,08 November 2018,4,Nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 3.5 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up
Barbeque Nation,Vivek Kumar Dubey,04 November 2018,5,"5 star standard . Specially mentioning RM Mr. Bivison and staff Mr. Gopal.. we were welcomed, served and treated with high standard quality. Also, the chef Basudev make sure that our prefrance is fulfilled.
Thank you Bivison and for taking care."
Barbeque Nation,Harry N,02 November 2018,4,"Excellent place.
Taste of food is good. Spread is good. Value for money.
Service is excellent.
If you wish to go for a barbeque, this is the best place in hyd."
Barbeque Nation,Asad Rana,31 October 2018,5,"Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.

Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.

Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down."
Barbeque Nation,The Foodie Bookworm,25 October 2018,4.5,"We are very satisfied with the food and the service was excellent. ""We want our customers to be fully Satisfied"" said the chef and he meant it."
Barbeque Nation,Prasad Kayal,21 October 2018,4,"We went to this place on Wednesday for Dinner. It was difficult to find a table and had to wait for 30 minutes. The ambience of the place is average and its a small place however the starters were really good (Crispy Corn, Panner Tikka, Mushroom and Fruit BBQ). Coming to the main course, it was average but the desserts were really good especially Gulab Jamun, Rabadi and Kulfi."
Barbeque Nation,Sudeshna Banerjee,21 October 2018,5,"Really These BarbeQue Nation's outlet is so friendly....i never seen before....we went there last night, total number were 40+...lots of kids were in my gang....they are playing a lot....they are means staffs of Barbeque Nation, always looking smile....now, foods are just too good...Kuch kehene ki baat i nehi hain"
Barbeque Nation,Epicure,14 October 2018,3,"To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. I can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter."
Barbeque Nation,Roopa2,10 October 2018,5,"We had a fantastic time and loved the service and food both. The serving personnel made extra sure of comfort for the kids, kudos to Azaad and team."
Barbeque Nation,Rabia Sultana,09 October 2018,2,"I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That‚Äôs what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation."
Barbeque Nation,Prachita Jayaswal,28 September 2018,4,"This place goes and keeps up with the name! Amazing starters. The chicken kebabs are wonderful. The crispy corn and the Cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome!! After the rounds of starters,. There wasn't any space for the main course so directly went for desserts. Their in house kulfis are the speciality here. Paan kulfi tastes the best! Gulab jamuns with ice-cream make the perfect combo."
Barbeque Nation,Fashion Shadz,26 September 2018,5,"Awesome food and awesome Service.Specially by Mr. Gopal who was awesome with his services .
Keep it up and Thumbs up for Barbeque nation , Gachibowli.
My birthday went awesome"
Barbeque Nation,Krishna Giri,19 September 2018,2,"Food quality has degraded than before.
Ice tea served was more proportion of water . Ice tea flavour was not there at all. Partha served over the counter was pathetic. It was having very bad quality of oil not even ghee. Very much upset with the food quality this time."
Barbeque Nation,Satyanarayana Murty Karra,17 September 2018,4,"Awesome place !!!

1. Good ambiance,
2. Great food ( Veg)
3. Chef always comes to your table to know if we are enjoying the starters and any improvement is needed or any special starter that we prefer etc.,


My kid loves this place and we have been there multiple times and still don't get bored."
Barbeque Nation,Epicurean Palette,31 August 2018,5,"And of course the best place to celebrate your special occasions. Beautiful place to dine with your friends and family. Perfect ambiance. Delicious food. A sweet gesture of cake from the restaurant itself and song by the staff, making it more special. And the varieties of kulfis."
Barbeque Nation,Rajesh,30 August 2018,5,"Good service, very good receiving nature.
Very well satisfied with his service and the food.
Outstanding service by azad hussain with good responsibility towards customers."
Barbeque Nation,Varun Reddy,29 August 2018,4,"Loved the food, ambience is good, deserts could be somewhat better but overall i would recommend this place. Staff is friendly. Chicken is the best of all the dishes they serve."
Barbeque Nation,Esli Jacinth,24 August 2018,3,"This was my first time at a ""Barbeque Nation."" I've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.
Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.
The good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.
I liked the ambience of this place, will definitely give another chance to this outlet ‚úåÔ∏è"
Barbeque Nation,Indranil Saha,15 August 2018,5,"I visited this branch for Independence Day lunch with two of my friends. As usual Barbecue Nation was superb at its food and service. People in Hyderabad prefer AB‚Äôs over BN, but somehow I felt BN is still a better place. Staff members were really good and everything was so delicious! We really enjoyed our time there. Thumbs up üëç"
Barbeque Nation,Shrikant,12 August 2018,5,It's always good to visit this place. We celebrate some of our most precious days. Good quality and service is excellent. I wish you keep this quality always.
Barbeque Nation,Karthik Kumar,12 August 2018,4,Service was excellent and staffs were much polite. Frequent visits by chef to make sure taste is acceptable was laudable but after a point it had bit vexed us. Ambiance was good but space was very less hence during weekends it sounds like bring in a market.
Barbeque Nation,Vivek Dasari,09 August 2018,5,Food is excellent.......ambience is very good......loved the Greek festival......Azad Hussian gave us a very good service......overall experience is excellent.....
Barbeque Nation,Abhiteja Ch,31 July 2018,5,"Amazing food and ambience.
Starters were simply delicious.
Desserts were also really good.
Would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place."
Barbeque Nation,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),31 July 2018,4,"Unlimited BBQ food with delicious desserts-
Ambiance-
Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.
Food-
As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very good. Chef himself came to our table to take the feedback."
Barbeque Nation,Prasanna Kalyan Vittapu,30 July 2018,5,The service is too good.. If you are not satisfied with any food item basudev will recook as per your wish and serves it again... The service is just excellent compared to other outlets..
Barbeque Nation,Atul Mani,27 July 2018,4,Food was tasty. Staffs were very friendly. Although the options in main course as well as for starters was a bit less and service was relatively slow when compared to other barbeques. Still would recommend to visit once.
Barbeque Nation,Chinmaya Barik,21 July 2018,1,"Visited it along with my friends for lunch today..
Most of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilled.Fish n chicken n prawn everything tastes same.After repetative reminder also they served the same.Also there is not much varieties are available for stater.Main course is ok.Deserts are pathetic.They are serving it for namesake..It's a horrible experience overall"
Barbeque Nation,ZENITH Meher,21 July 2018,1,"I visited today . To be honest it's waste of money .... Everything that they serve tastes the same ... There is no variety of tastes... Fish and chicken almost tastes similar... It's like they have put the same spices on Fish .. chicken , mushroom and prawns.. Deserts are simply the worst.... It's like just name sake they are serving ...
For those who want to taste something good.. it's not recommended."
Barbeque Nation,Neha Aggarwal,20 July 2018,5,"I went there with my parents, and it was totally worth it. The service was extremely good and my parents loved every bit of it.
Starters and dessert always amazing.
Main course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main course.
Overall it has been one of my favourite place ."
Barbeque Nation,Smruti Ranjan Mishra,15 July 2018,5,Qutub Yasin - It was really an awesome experience with these guys. He was really friendly and we had a very good conversation him. I will come back hungry for more.
Barbeque Nation,Srinivas,14 July 2018,4,"Barbeque Nation absolutly Great place to Dine with frinds r family..
Buffet was simply mouth watering food..
Ambince superb
Service great ..
Great exprince we had..
We want to visit again ......."
Barbeque Nation,Salman.Ghaffoor,07 July 2018,4,"Went for lunch along with wife and bro for birthday lunch, And Lunch was perfect and had some decent items on menu, Gopal took good care of us. I would recommend this place for great lunch."
Barbeque Nation,Vedant Killa,06 July 2018,5,"Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.

Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.

I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.

Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. üòçüò¨ there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.

Always up for a BarBQue grill üçñ"
Barbeque Nation,Sunil Tatipelly,05 July 2018,3,"Visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week. 

Most of the starters were served slowly. Even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff. Fish starters were not well cooked. Chicken starters & crispy corn were good.

Mains and desserts were good as usual, not much different from others."
Barbeque Nation,Tarannum Ara,03 July 2018,5,"More expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place, you will realise why it's worth every penny. From the starters to the main course. Everything was rich in flavour and taste. Softest mutton sheekh kebab ever I tasted here. The menu didn't include mutton keema, yet our waiter Gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan. His hospitality is worth mentioning. The head chef came and took our feedback. Very warm ambience, good people and great food. Don't miss this place."
Barbeque Nation,Ritobrata Choudhury,02 July 2018,4,"Barbeque was good in taste. Quality of fish chicken mutton was perfect. Though main course variety was less, overall i liked the place. Diligent service by all staffs. The head chef also wanted feedback for the food, which i personally like very much! Happy to visit another time!"
Barbeque Nation,RAVI RATHORE,01 July 2018,4,"Good food. I visited 4 times and i like the food.. good hospitality.... ambiance is ok..
Deserts was mouthwatering...I will definitely visit again.. thanks for making my day special.. üôÇüôÇüôÇ
all the bestüëçüëçüëçüëç"
Barbeque Nation,Saumya Ranjan,30 June 2018,4,"It‚Äôs a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. I should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. The main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. It‚Äôs a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout."
Barbeque Nation,Yoga,26 June 2018,4,We went here from office. A group of 17 members. We were the first so seating was not an issue. I had veg starters and it was marvellous. For once the spice levels matched my lower than normal Hyderabad spice margins. The paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire. The corn fried were very good. Food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup. Desserts we very good. On the whole a satisfying experience.
Barbeque Nation,Chanda,23 June 2018,4,"Always good , for non veg starters are too good than veg , still overall it's good , always biryani will be same kasmiri flavoured , hope next time I may get new flavoured biryani , rest all staff and service were good"
Barbeque Nation,Sind Hu,23 June 2018,4,Barbeques are one of my favorites. Barbeque Nation is a perfect blend of good food and Ambience. Always been best at servicing. Would be better if they try something new for birthday wishes.
Barbeque Nation,Deepak,23 June 2018,2.5,"Quick review points
- slippery floor .. be careful when you good with high heels or children. Perhaps they don't have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place
- bathrooms meant for rotten rats... Dirty washroom and tiny doors. Hefties and jumbo sizes, you can't get in
- service ... Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.
- advance bookings ... They don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in
- pan kulfi... It should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color. Pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds."
Barbeque Nation,Sai Prasad Koneru,22 June 2018,5,Food is good. The service from the staff is excellent. Worth every rupee. Reasonable price when compared to other barbeque.. service from the staff is excellent...
Barbeque Nation,Siddhartha,11 June 2018,4,"Serving is nice,food is good starters are good enough to get a 3 star main course is excellent when compared to absolute barbecues but star of the show is malai kulfi.absolute show.stopper of the buffet."
Barbeque Nation,Deepthi,04 June 2018,3,"Barbeque‚Äôs are famous for their huge spread in the starters range, so was this place. Have almost visited most of the barbeques in the city. Similar menu and nothing outstanding in this restaurant. Taste was average.
Staff were very polite and the service was good. Loved the pan kulfi."
Barbeque Nation,Raj Kamal,27 May 2018,4,Good place for birthdays and similar events. Wide variety of food items available. Had visited the place during some fest wherein I found lots of varieties.
Barbeque Nation,Chandrakanth P,26 May 2018,4,"Visited this place on our marriage anniversary. Food was excellent. especially the starters. liked the mutton sheek kebab more. meat was tender and tasty. bbq prawns were good as well. veggies will love crispy corn here. Can improve on the desserts variety.
Service was excellent. Right from the valet guy to the manager, every one were courteous.
Azad who served food for us was very assistive and always checked if we needed anything. Chef was kind enough to ask us about the food and cooked chicken specially for us which was terrific. All seemed perfect for a perfect day."
Barbeque Nation,Kanukunta Saimounika,26 May 2018,5,"One of the best place I've ever went to buffet. Especially the great service provided by the agents over there , it really impressed. It was on my birthdae :) April 2. Sorry for the late review.
Starting from Welcome Drink till the complimentary cake , the food was so delicious.... Great Job !!!!"
Barbeque Nation,Swarooparani Gali,24 May 2018,4,"Have been there for our wedding anniversary. Excellent service provided be staff. Non veg starters were too good. Ambiance was also good. Didn't feel the main course that great compared to starters (Didnt like Chicken Dum biryani). Enjoyed desserts a lot especially Kulfi

Thank Staff for helping us and celebrating our event :)"
Barbeque Nation,Teju,21 May 2018,5,"You guys are really awesome. What else a foodie like me can expect for lunch, good food and great hospitality......I should take a minute from my routine to appreciate the service and hospitality provided by Mr. Vibhishan and Mr. Susheel.......
Though you are the best the curiousness to improve by incorporating inputs/feedback from customers by you are great....."
Barbeque Nation,Vinay,20 May 2018,5,"A place to go with friends and family. Hospitality is just at the next level. Staffs are very polite and know how to delight the customers. Well, starters and deserts are simply awesome. I don't munch much on the main course (not enough space left after yummy starters).
I liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where I felt contained an egg (I am vegetarian). They not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream. You guys are just too good in the hospitality. Will love keep coming back there."
Barbeque Nation,Priyanka Paul,15 May 2018,5,"Numerous options. Grilled chicken and prawn , all the kulfis in different flavors are tasty. Pineapple jalebi was very different but okz in taste.A perfect place to satisfy ur hunger with great food , ambiance and service.

Great staff. The service is very good. You can ask them to serve the starters according to ur taste requirement (spicy or mild). Please do the advance booking as it have rush on all the days."
Barbeque Nation,Advait Shiralkar,14 May 2018,4,"I have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time. I love the items which they keep on their grills especially the non-vegetarian ones. in the non-veg ones I most like their prawns and the fish. I had forgot to mention the service and the ambience. the service is good and even the ambience is great. in of the grill I like the crispy corn and  the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome. as we went there on jewel of the sea festival, I had got crab curry (with no flesh in it) and we had butter naan and tandoori roti. crab curry was not so great but nice. the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice. we even went for curd rice and dal makhni. both of them were nice. my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome."
Absolute Sizzlers,Arun Sharma,21 May 2019,2,"Service was pathetic. Ordered a sizzler with lamb, was told no lamb. Ordered another sizzle with Noodles. It took 15 mins to serve that one. Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup."
Absolute Sizzlers,Pallavi Mitra,21 May 2019,1,"I ordered a chicken American chopsey, and they gave me this. There was no noodles in it nor soup. The dish was more of a chicken salad. Wrong order delivered."
Absolute Sizzlers,Avi Ranjan,20 May 2019,5,"Great place üëçüèª Awesome ambience and food , staff is good and seafood delight is a must try also sizzling chicken üëçüèª come for budget lunch with your girlfriend üòÖ"
Absolute Sizzlers,Raju,18 May 2019,3,"When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract."
Absolute Sizzlers,Ravi Yogesh,17 May 2019,4,"Visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets. The buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. Would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet."
Absolute Sizzlers,Ramesh Pedada,17 May 2019,5,"Thanks thanks thanks ones again thank you for your such a hospitality . ..it's great place to dine...

Absolute Sizzlers,Kurmarao Kuna,17 May 2019,5,"Its nice place to dine for team lunch ...
Great service
Great food...

Nice ambiance
we want to visit again we loved service thanks team absolute"
Absolute Sizzlers,Jagan Jrb,17 May 2019,1,"I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don‚Äôt think I would go back there again."
Absolute Sizzlers,Ganga Chauhan,17 May 2019,5,"Its great place dine absolute sizzler absolutely great place to dine with family and friends....

Today lunch we visited with family we had great experiences ... We Loved the food n service we want to visit again........"
Absolute Sizzlers,Aparajita Deshpande,17 May 2019,1,"I‚Äôm sorry but this isn‚Äôt the right place for online orders. I did not get my complete order and what I received was also not what I had ordered for! And nothing was done, apart from receiving Z credits, because that is only what zomato can do!
Check your orders before you send it to the customer."
Absolute Sizzlers,Anil Pullela,15 May 2019,1,"How do you expect me to be nice when the food I ordered when I am literally hungry came spoiled and the Zomato support people are not of any help.
I need my money back."
Absolute Sizzlers,Karthik,14 May 2019,4,"Went with family on a week day. We ordered the below:

Exotic Vegetable Pasta (3.5/5) - this can be better

Veg Sizzler with Baked beans (4/5)

Paneer Butter Masala Sizzler (3/5) - asked for less spicy, but it was spicy. Somehow could not enjoy the taste 100%.

Cottage cheese steak sizzler (4.5/5)

Fresh Lime Soda (3/5) - I can make better soda at home.

Ambience (4/5)

Overall it was a decent experience so rating 3.8, but things can be improved."
Absolute Sizzlers,Krishnakanth M,14 May 2019,3,Good sizzler taste. Portion size may be too much for a single person. They were kind enough to share all the sauces extra to mix and have different tastes.
Absolute Sizzlers,Sumit Kumar Singh,12 May 2019,4,"Went for team outing here
All sizzlers pretty are same here just main indegridint changes. The service is a bit slow. Ambience is nice. There brownie sizzler is good. The staff is courteous."
Absolute Sizzlers,Bunty Kundnani,11 May 2019,1,They delivered a stale food at night when ordered from zomato. I paid INR 400 for stale food and when i tried calling restaurant had closed. No one helped
Absolute Sizzlers,Kiran Kumar Kura,01 May 2019,4,"Cool place to party with friends &family, good choice of sizzlers available, juice & smoothies also available, little more care will make them perfect, suggesting to place cabage leaves over sizzler plate to avoid colour change of lower level food, wash room at inconvenient place, found lot of delivery boys near counter.
I visited on 26th Feb for my daughters birthday dinner"
Absolute Sizzlers,Jay Dixit,28 April 2019,5,"Super sizzlers with decent staff and offers are enough to njoy the place , all should go there to have tasty sizzlers ......i will visit again"

Being a foodie it's important we suss things out in person. One of the puzzle I came across was this place Absolute Sizzler I had mixed reviews and I said let me.try. been here and loved the place.. people have lot of different views and takes on Sizzler's and how they expect it to be like a Dhaba style .... Here it's a fusion of both Desi and videsi tadkaa... So keep an open mind to ravish some delicious sizzlers.... I give a happy 4/5."

Absolute Sizzlers,Pranay Krishna,25 April 2019,1,Worst place to have a sizzler. Tried hyderabadi sizzler which was just rotten chicken biriyani on a hot plate. The noodles in the veg sizzler were very bad as well. These guys dont know how to make a sizzler. The staff was also not well trained.
Absolute Sizzlers,Sudipta Routray,24 April 2019,4,As a sizzlers Fan went to longe my taste buds with sizzlers.Order Fish n chips along with chilly chicken for straters and oh my fell in love with fish n chips.. Chicken Sizzlers were really gud... Loved the ambience and the music.. worth visiting the place.. Fish n chips are must try.

Absolute Sizzlers,S G K,19 April 2019,3,The Mixed Biryani is good. But need to improve the presentation and the portion. The pieces are not cooked properly. Better to check this except that all ok.
Absolute Sizzlers,Sai Kumar Machabathuni,18 April 2019,4,"It was my first time to taste this dish and totally satisfied. I cut down that 5th star because it lacks spice and realized that there are spicy sauces that can be added to the dish, after our plates were empty.
Good ambience and service"

Absolute Sizzlers,Naresh Kumar,10 April 2019,1,"I have order veg sizzler but and they served me the non veg sizzler. I had it without knowing it. The server was rude, unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent. There is no proper communication between chef and server. It was worst experience in my life as I am a pure vegeterian. I would recommend not to visit this place. I would choose negative rating as a best option."
Absolute Sizzlers,Ratan Ray,10 April 2019,5,"Its great palace to dine food was great

Absolute Sizzlers,Pavan Buduguppa,10 April 2019,1,"Went to this for an office lunch, the time taken to get the food out is unbelievably high. On top of this a vegetarian colleague was told that the food is vegetarian and got served chicken instead. Never coming back!"
Absolute Sizzlers,Srinivas,09 April 2019,5,"absolute sizzlers located at Snl terminals Level 3

Amazing food, tasty finger food I recommend Cheese stuffed mushroom & Fish n Chips and many more to try.
When coming to Sizzlers, Fish shashlik sizzler is the best.
Must try caramel custard and Sizzling brownie dessert.

* highly recommended Best sizzlers restaurant
We will visit again"
Absolute Sizzlers,Parijat Ray,08 April 2019,2,"We had a very bad experience here. We have ordered Fish Shashilk and Sizzling Chicken sizzlers. The Fish Shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.

I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler."
Absolute Sizzlers,Paromita Das,07 April 2019,5,Prakash served us food . He is very generous and did tell us the speciality .. must try grilled chicken sizzler and sizzling brownie.. they are just awesome.
Absolute Sizzlers,Anirban Gupta,07 April 2019,5,Sizzlers are too good. Prakash served it really well and explained about the food is really impressive. Must try here the grilled chicken sizzler and the sizzling brownie

Absolute Sizzlers,Maitri Batabyal,05 April 2019,5,"Best Sizzlers in Hyderabad till date. Very good staff service. I love this place.

Grilled Fish Sizzler is mouth watering. You can try Seekh kebab Paneer tikka sizzler also time if you‚Äôre a Vegan."
Absolute Sizzlers,Guttula Suresh,04 April 2019,1,Worst food and service.. After long waiting we got the food.. We ordered starters and sizzler.. They prepared the food and forgot I think.. This is the first I have seen a place with starters in cold stage... Been to this place for more than 10 times and never had complaints on food. But today is nightmare.. Worst food and their best item is chicken shashlik sizzler which is worst today.. Bye bye Absolute..
Absolute Sizzlers,Tahir Maqbool,01 April 2019,4,"This place is good for a casual lunch and dinner with friends or family. This place offers a wide variety of Sizzlers and other Starters and Main Course as well . During my last 2 visits I‚Äôve tried a non veg Platter, 2-3 different types of non-veg Sizzlers, Tikka Pizza with add-ons like fries üçü n all.

While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
Service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!. Well not just that ask for a chutney or Mayonnaise or a water bottle you ain‚Äôt getting it until you call up to them couple of times."
Absolute Sizzlers,Rukesh Asurati,29 March 2019,5,"Food is incredible. I have visited several times but still the menu has lot of items to cover. The staff is very friendly and Shravan Kumar is very much good at his service and also in ambience. A must visit place.
Spicy chicken Sizzler with noodles is ultimate here."
Absolute Sizzlers,Suman Dhanavath,28 March 2019,5,"The place where to dine finely and with good ambience treating very well with their service

Absolute Sizzlers,Shankar Murthy,26 March 2019,3,"Been here on a Sunday for dinner. Not a great ambiance. Buffet was not pretty good, so preferred ala carte. Ordered 3 starters Pepper chicken, Honey chilli potato and veg seekh kabab. Kabab was not cooked well remaining were good in taste. No good options in desserts.
Starters 3.5/5
Soup 3/5
Ambiance 2/5
Staff behavior 4/5"
Absolute Sizzlers,Mudit Kejriwal,26 March 2019,4,"Spacious ambience. Amazingly friendly staff. Quick service. Good food. I ordered Cottage Cheese Steak Sizzler. Garlic sauce base with noodles and fries. The steak was delicious. Fries were crispy. Noodles were bland. Had to ask for extra garlic sauce. One sizzler is enough for any individual with a decent appetite. May visit this place if you are craving for sizzlers.

Might burn your pocket if you don't have Zomato Gold."
Absolute Sizzlers,Prithvi Krishna,24 March 2019,5,Awesome food great taste and great people ....good ambiance waiters are soo kind üòé@sravan Is really soo nice üëç my fav is pasta here üòç read sauce creamy pasta üçù
Absolute Sizzlers,Rajarshi,24 March 2019,4,"Value for money - yummy sizzlers at throwaway prices! However decking up of the restaurant as well as air conditioning doesn‚Äôt seem to work too well. Overall a very good deal at the offered prices.
PS: Please increase the sizzling menu and decrease ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù servings since this place is meant to serve sizzlers absolutely! Cheers!"
Absolute Sizzlers,Chakradhar Koduru,24 March 2019,5,"Ambience and taste of food in this restaurant was good
. Worth if you have zomato gold too. Shankar who served us very polite. Will be visiting once again soon."
Absolute Sizzlers,Arianking2756,24 March 2019,2,Not worth visiting. Waited for a very long time about half an hour. People who know what a sizzler is will not like it for sure. I think restaurant name should be changed as they have buffet and other indian food in the menu.
Absolute Sizzlers,Dattu Metre,24 March 2019,5,"I would like to share my dine experience at the absolute sizzler
Really nice I felt very happy with their hospitality and service food and ambaence as well as

Absolute Sizzlers,Ramyasudha Konda,22 March 2019,1,"Had a bad experience today in Absolute sizzler. Chicken served in the sizzler is half cooked and we left the chicken without eating. Soft Drink served is not chilled its room temperature. The person who served soft drink has not informed us that the drink is not available in chilled temperature, staright way he served it and then informed us that it is no chilled . Overall experience is very bad."
Absolute Sizzlers,Chavala Mutyala Rao,22 March 2019,1,"Hi,
I have ordered 3 Hyderabad Dum Biryani costing Rs 300/- per biryani, In total Rs 900/-.
Quantity is very less and with no quality. All Mutton pieces are waste peaces.
I called up Hotel to inform the same but they are not responding.
Poor service and poor quality.
Only 1 person can eat Rs 300/- biryani . Very Upset."
Absolute Sizzlers,Ashish Mehta,22 March 2019,5,"The sizzlers here are unlike any other place, just amazing! I've had the Ohris sizzlers and they were okay, but the sizzlers are better at Absolute Sizzlers, and lesser at price. Most visit for some sizzle!"
Absolute Sizzlers,Rin Zuali,22 March 2019,1,I'd give a better review if the food was at least doable. The place lacks ambience and there were a lot of minor inconveniences due to communication problems.
Absolute Sizzlers,Reema Arora,22 March 2019,1,"Bad food, bad ambience, bad service, clueless waiters and expensive food. Such a waste of money. Everything was bad. I regret going to this place."
Absolute Sizzlers,Anusha Reddy,22 March 2019,1,"The place serves below average food. The place is supposed to specialize in sizzlers, but that didn't taste good either. To add up, the waiters were totally clueless. Utter waste of money!"
Absolute Sizzlers,Rudhir Kakoti,21 March 2019,3,"Mostly overrated

Went with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls. Now coming to food, ordered chicken drumsticks,but taste was not that great then ordered one non veg sizzler which was also not that great. Noodles in the sizzler were tasteless. Overall did not find the experience which we were expecting."
Absolute Sizzlers,Sree Bhavya,21 March 2019,1,This is the worst pasta i have ever had....pasta is sweet and dry and not even cutlery oregani or chillifslkes are provided never order......
Absolute Sizzlers,Anoy Sarkar,19 March 2019,3,"I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce. I wouldn't say it was the worst, but it was not up there. There was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded. The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked."
Absolute Sizzlers,Goutami Ganta,18 March 2019,3,"I have been here twice.
Once I tried the buffet, whcih is waste of money.The spread could be better.
The Ala carte was good,I had chicken sizzlers and fish tikka.
Taste: 3.5/5
Quantity:3/5
Service:3.5/5
Ambience:3/5"
Absolute Sizzlers,Manikanta Gupta Thota,17 March 2019,4,"Ambiance was good here.
Veg Sizzlers we ordered are not upto the mark.
It can be improved more.
Service was also very slow.
Over all it's ok for one time visit."
Absolute Sizzlers,Kumar Abhishek,16 March 2019,4,"One of the few sizzlers restaurant in Gachibowli area. Had been here a few times earlier and i must say there range of non veg (chicken) sizzlers is amazing. veg sizzler was found to be ok by my accompainment. So here gies my review:

Food:4/5
Ambience:4/5
Service:4/5
Budget: 4/5

P. S: I was able to use Zomato Gold on food here."
Absolute Sizzlers,Sai Krishna,16 March 2019,3,"It was an ok ok place ambiance was quite ok
Every item in the menu was costly and the sizzler was also not upto the mark
Serving was a bit slow and preparation time was high more or less it was not a fine dining experience"
Absolute Sizzlers,Ronali Senapati,13 March 2019,5,"Ordered 3 sizzlers
Starting with spicy chicken sizzlers: It's the best among what we had ordered
For veg lovers must try the veg satellite sizzlers you would find it really worth it
And then we had chicken Manchurian sizzlers which indeed was also nice
I found this the best place for trying sizzlers
Worth the money and
Had a good service from Shravan Kumar"
Absolute Sizzlers,Ankita,13 March 2019,4,"A Friday outing in Absolute Sizzlers. Quite pocket friendly option (even more if you have Zomato gold).
Had ordered Mushroom sizzler and Chicken sizzler. The portion is enough for 1 person. We had ordered French fries as side dish.
Though I am dedicated Non-veg lover, I really loved the Mushroom sizzler more than the chicken sizzler.
A must visit around SLN teriminus"
Absolute Sizzlers,Sohini Chakraborty,12 March 2019,1,"We went for lunch and ordered two sizzlers, veg and non veg. Both were not up to the mark. Taste was not good and portion size was less. Not enough veggies in the dish. But one good thing I liked the ambience. Need to improve loads on the taste part"

Absolute Sizzlers,Raj Patel,09 March 2019,1,"Had a lot of expectations when I read the ne for the first time. Was able to visit it after a month.
What a disappointment it was. It's named sizzler but has nothing close to sizzler. You guys really need to work on the art of making sizzler. It looks like sizzler. It only looks"
Absolute Sizzlers,Vishnu Vardhan,06 March 2019,5,Great sizzlers.. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Nice place to hang around with colleagues or friends. I recommend to try this place and food.. Amazing combos are offered by this restaurant.

Absolute Sizzlers,Mani Jha,24 February 2019,2,"I have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good. While the chicken wings I ordered were nice, but they ruined the American Chopsuey. It was more like eating a soupy noodles than a Chopsuey. I wish they would have made that better.
Ambience was good, staff were okay."
Absolute Sizzlers,Khaja Rahamtulla,23 February 2019,5,"Whoever people looking for delicious food and humble service at the place of absolute sizzler only i can say that I had good experience there especially i heard about that discount on ala carte menu and on the buffet 50%off that was really cool and great dine to have, at that reasonable price number of buffet items which were making us feel tasty thanks to absolute Sizzler's ...."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Shibu Singh,25 May 2019,4,This place is amazing for weekend fun hangouts and let your tireness go away. The DJ is awesome and plays best bollywood songs and punjabi too. The veg pizza and pastas are pretty good to try along with fruit punch. But if you want to have a good fun filled and energetic time go here. This place the best music to groove to and has pretty ambience to get clicked.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Vishwa Talati,24 May 2019,1,"This is what we were served today when we ordered for Grilled Paneer. I think this was someone's left over which we were served. Giving the benefit of doubt that they might have made some mistake, I informed them that it might be a mistake but the manager said that they didn't have enough plated to serve and hence they served it like this. After a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it. BUT the story does not end here. They served us ice cold paneer in a different plate. I will just finish my beer and leave now."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Pritha Majumder,23 May 2019,5,"I am absolutely in love with this place, not much hyped but still crowded. I recommend to visit on weekdays and weekends can get overcrowded. Pizza was good, so were the other titbits but what I liked most was there service, took time to place the order at the POS but the bartender whipped up my drink in no second bad I never had to call out for a repeat, it was ready each time. Overall I go to this place every other week one of the best party place around."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,King Khan,21 May 2019,3,"Been to this place along with friends for a small party,We loved the place & but only concern was service associates were rude &Helpless..When we complained for burned naan was served then the server stated that we serve Naan likes this only,He didnot even apologised...very pathetic experience we had..."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Kapil Nitharwal,18 May 2019,4,"This place is absolutely mind-blowing. Great music, great service, great food. It's crowded because so many wanna be here, is so epic! If you wanna spend some good time with your friends, dance your heart out, and blow off some steam, The Lal Street is the place for you."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Stephen Reji,18 May 2019,3,"I had gone to this place for team dinner. The place is in a mall and has a good ambience. We ordered many starters and drinks. The food was decent, nothing special. It is a good place to party and dance."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rekha Bansode,17 May 2019,1,"Worst service experienced ever.
Nobody is concerned about even taking the order.
its just waste of our evening.
Not as expected.
This review is completely for the Service we received."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Neetika Sahai,12 May 2019,4,"I have been to this place with friends for friday night. The place has amazing vibes. They were playing awesome bollywood numbers. The place was so crowded that it's do difficult to find a place to chill. Getting a table is task. Food is also good. One advice, go a little early. You will get place and even drinks will be at decent prices."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Devin,12 May 2019,1,"Apparently that's their garnish. Oh yeah, the orange peel on the plate. Was my drink the dustbin? Lol üòÖ. Oh wait, I guess maybe I never had a cocktail. That's what the waiter said. Horrible service. The guy wasn't ready to even call the manager."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Shruthi Ayalasomayajula,11 May 2019,4,"This was a good place, cozy and outside seating arrangement was romantic. Amazing place for the get-togethers and for a bunch of friends. Food was okay. We had nachos, the salsa can taste better a bit, it was bland.

Food-4/5"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Srikanth Iyer,11 May 2019,1,"This place is stupid and extremely discriminating . As a guy you are not allowed to enter the dance floor . The bouncers are hostile and say that unless you have a girl , you cannot enter the dance floor . I understand there might be instances of guys Misbehaving but the attitude of the management towards people is extremely hostile . I'm never coming here"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Vaishnavi Gayatri,11 May 2019,4,"Went for lunch with friends.
Service and ambiance are good. I personally liked mocktail while food can be better.
The taste was not great while quantity is okay."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rahul Roy,10 May 2019,1,"The Lady Bouncer Aunty with glasses at the desk didn't allow us to go inside as we were wearing Slides. She referred the slides as 'Slippers' straight to our faces. They should've mentioned about 'Shoes' in Zomato app. I feel so sad about the half knowledge of the aunty at the Reception desk. Will never visit this place, Ever."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Debasmita Ghosh,09 May 2019,4,Friday night visited there with my girl gang. I had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle. Was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space. I loved the food they served‚Äî each and every item. The DJ for that night was very good and we danced till the last song! Only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed. Expect better care to be taken !
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Poonam Nanda Ghosh,09 May 2019,3,"It was a night out with gal pals.

When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.

Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.

They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.

The server came and took our orders.

We ordered starters and drinks.

As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.

It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.

Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.

Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.

Anyways moving on

The cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.

The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.

The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.

Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.

Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.

Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sandeep Jujare,09 May 2019,1,"They always deny the table on weekends or Friday even though we book on Zomato or other apps due to high demand, this is not fair if we did a pre booking"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sukumar Kondaparthy,08 May 2019,2,"Went here on a Thursday, the staff were really pathetic in service and no Zomato Gold etc were eligible. They could have responded in a proper way when asked why it's not valid. (since it's ladies night)"

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,M B,06 May 2019,4,"GOOD PLACE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS. NICE MUSIC NICE AMBIENCE NICE FOOD.
It also has a outdoor seating so one who likes to have that seating. it is also a good place with good atmosphere.
Its a Bar Exchange so Order wisely that's the only thing to Take Care of.
If you are traveling to hyd. and don't want to go any random place for pubbing. You surely can rely on this place."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,The Food O‚ÄôClock,05 May 2019,4,"To enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward.

Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn‚Äôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).

We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.

Singapore Noodles - 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5
Chicken Wet - 4/5
White Sauce Pasta - 2/5
They didn‚Äôt have pizza on the day we went.

Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.

Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

Recommended"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Manasa Goparaju,05 May 2019,5,"Nice place to be. Super good food and drinks, friendly staff, cool ambiance. Enjoyed our time here.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Abhinav Kulshrestha,05 May 2019,4,"Good concept, based on some other existing clubs though. There is a serious need of utilizing the space properly, which at present requires quite some work. Limited dance floor, have to be protected by bouncers, everybody blocks the road after last call but ignoring all that, food is good, Music is good, and projector is okaish."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Praveen Kumar,05 May 2019,5,"The lal street is awesome for food and beverages, one of the best place to hangout with friends the prices are decent so one can try here.
The dance floor is good and no restrictions for stages to dance on the floor.
THe waiters are too friendly they suggest better than any others bars."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Naveen Metta,04 May 2019,1,"Bunch of hypocrites. One cannot enter unless they have a girl beside them. One cannot enter unless they have shoes tied to their feet. One cannot enter unless their lower limbs are fully covered (for guys). We pay you to get us drunk,not to judge us based on our footwear and whom we tag along. You think someone without shoes can't behave or pay you the bill? Pathetic stereotypes."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,PRATIK AGARWAL,04 May 2019,4,Went on a dry day. Still the service was good. The music and the dj is really good. We had fun. They have a fairly big dance floor which is a nice touch with cool graffiti.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Tahishi Gupta,03 May 2019,4,"Ordered chicken pizza , missal pav and cocktails. Missal pav was ok but the chicken pizza was just too good. Ambience is awesome and unique."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Vinamra Gehlot,03 May 2019,4,Few of my favourite places in Hyderabad. Wide range of food and drinks available. The taste of food is above average. Can get cocktails and beer at a very descent price. 8/10 on the ambiance.

Overall a nice place to hangout"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Manisha Panda,01 May 2019,3,"Since its close to the it crowd, been here numerous times. I like the music and drinks as well. Food is not their fort√®. You've to be very selective in that. Would recommend to go for starters. I've tried buffet here as well which I didn't personally like. The ambience is cool though but the staff has been unaccommodating to us one time."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Dinesh Naidu,01 May 2019,4,"Went there on a weekday, but being a ladies night the place had a decent crowd.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Abhinav Singh,01 May 2019,1,"Service was way too slow. We had to wait 40 minutes for a single dish. The drinks menu (on the app) is good but they never have enough stock so don't even bother going here for drinks. Single guys are not allowed on the dance floor. BBQ chicken wings was putrid. Worst of all? Look at the picture I attached, they cheat you by giving you smaller shot glasses when you're very drunk. Horrible experience."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Kandarp,30 April 2019,4,"Nice place and competitive pricing, i am always a fan of the the concept by which these guys operate... Food is good specially biryani... didnt expect such great biryani at a pub..."

I felt like we are treated like beggars and there is no proper grooming with staff . I didn‚Äôt saw proper response paid for a customer . As usual the food is good. Dj was good with nice songs.This time the overall experience was totally badüòñüò°üò¨‚òπÔ∏è"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ishani Shah,28 April 2019,1,Horrible experience. Wouldn't want to come here ever again. Horrible food. Horrible service. Extremely disappointed with the entire package.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rupam Das,28 April 2019,3,"The rooftop of the place is quite good. But, only drawback is that the place is small. Thus, it was overcrowded and there was little place to move."

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Zarar Khan,28 April 2019,4,"One of the best bars I have visited in Hyderabad so far...It has a quirky concept of
BarExchange.

Its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends, has a groovy music and a big dance floor, it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends.
It's all based on the demand and supply that day!
A large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. All you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.
The food is acceptably good and service is quick."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sonu Tomar,28 April 2019,5,"Awesome pub with great ambience. Liquor prices go up and down based on demand, like sensex. Nice concept pub. Service is also good. Seperate dance floor one of the unique feature."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Atulay Mahajan,28 April 2019,3,The place is mostly crowded on the weekends. It is better to go with a prior reservation. Prices are a little high. Music is good. Service is slow. Dishes could taste better.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Shubhra Dey,28 April 2019,4,"I have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there. Mostly I used to order thali for lunch. Which was worthy. This was my first physical visit to the restaurant. And I was very amazed to see all the glory around me. Ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. Trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.

Ambience - 4.5 out of 5

Food - 4 out of 5 (cost could be lower side slightly)

Staff service - 5 out of 5"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Depak Jena,27 April 2019,5,Been here many time and really like the place for drinks and finger foods. Crowd generally come around 10pm. Dj is also nice. Bar tenders are really cool and friendly.One mushroom coated one I remember which I order every time. That beats the nonveg starters too.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ramiya Dixit,27 April 2019,3,"U can try just for different environment. Food is just ok, i tried paneer tikka, corn, chicken manchurian, pepper chicken. Go in happy hours."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Priyambada Choudhury,27 April 2019,5,Loved their dance floor and drinks menu. Would highly recommend the blue curacao for mocktails and their Cosmo for the cocktail. Their pasta is one of the best preparations in my opinion. Definitely recommend a revisit.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Hrithik Sethia,27 April 2019,4,"Have been a number of times to the lal street .
I have loved the ambience here. The crowd was pretty good and had a great time. It would have been better If I would have got table , as I had made reservations. THE DJ was just fine and was playing too many old songs."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Srinivas Reddy Pidaparti,27 April 2019,5,"It's a good place with bollywood /mix music.Good place for basic chill scenes with friends.it had a decent dance floor, good food and drinks"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ravi Teja,21 April 2019,1,Lal street management didn't allow us . Zomato doesn't mention stags are not allowed here in the app. I went there and came back. Is it a girl required to enter lal street? crazy
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Tirtha Das,20 April 2019,4,"Went there on an IPL night. Music and ambience is nice. We ordered drinks and a couple of starters such as stuffed mushroom, chicken in black bean sauce, jalapeno poppers and a fish dish. All the dishes were good but the jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushroom were impressive. The service is slow though and ordering drinks on the app might become a challange at times. Overall a nice place to hangout."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sivapriya Sridhar,16 April 2019,3,"Interesting cocktail menu, which a wide range of starters to try. There is a constant live screen showcasing the trading prices to drinks available ."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Chaitanya Banala,16 April 2019,3,"Filtered entry - Check
Welcome assistance - Check
Crowd - Check
Ambience - Check

What's great? Nothing.

It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.

The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.

Overall, I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night. We left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night.

The cocktails are good though."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Anand Mahanty,16 April 2019,4,A great party place and a decent size dance floor to try out all your new moves and get loose. The food is tasty and love the concept of ordering drinks via app as per drink exchange rate.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Chintan Patel,15 April 2019,4,"Grate place for food lovers, the tempting and mouth watering dishes are speechless, loved the ambiance and the vibe of the place, surely recommended for its food and ambiance."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Arha Krishna Inamdar,13 April 2019,2,"We are here on Thursday night and place was empty at the time we reached but they says every table is reserved , so we found a place finally and ordered Maggi pizza which took them 40 minutes to serve by that time we loose our appetite !! Even customer service is late ! Food was good but they did not accept dine out pay !"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Neha Khatri,13 April 2019,4,"Good ambience, good food, good dance place.

Three of us girls went to this place on a rainy Friday evening and it turned out to be good fun. We ordered:

White sauce pasta: it was awesomely tasty. The sauce was made correctly with the right consistency. There were vegetables in it.

Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.

Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.

We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).

It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.

All in all, an awesome experience and I would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Amarender Reddy Mamidi,12 April 2019,5,"Ambiance, staff, environment was all set to peaks. Music was much much appreciated. I was been there on ladies night but that doesn‚Äôt stopped stags to get in and the crowd was amazing. Best bar stock exchange witnessed up to now. We had a very good day watching IPL match."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Raja Srivathsav,12 April 2019,4,"Amazing place!
The ambience is good and the music is even great!
I‚Äôve been here thrice in the past three weeks and it turned out to be pretty amazing experience always.

Their exchange system of liquor pricing is quite good and affordable to most.
I‚Äôve even had Jameson for 140 bucks a peg! üòÖüòÖ
Their LIT is effective üòõ

I‚Äôve tried their chicken tikka biryani and hot Asian noodles!
Chicken tikka Biryani was amazing! I loved it! üòç

Ambience: 3
Service: 3
Food: 5

Will I visit this place again?: YES! YES! YES!

Btw: They have liquor at mrp on every Mondays!"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sujyosna,11 April 2019,5,The music was over the top and it has a decent dance floor. Food was good and this place accepts zomato gold 1+1 offer. As it‚Äôs a bar exchange you will get to enjoy drinks at lower cost as well üòâ
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Supriyarao50,11 April 2019,5,I can't tell you how awesome the food has been. I ordered Chinese Choupsey and Hot Asian noodles with a Roasted veg shack. Damn. I was shook at the quantity because it was a lot for 2 people. Absolutely Loveddddddd how it tasted! I cannot begin to explain the amazing taste of the saut√©ed and partially barbecued flavor of the vegetables. I'm a pure vegetarian and Lal exchange is now my fav place to eat now. üíú
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Gopinath Mamidi,10 April 2019,4,"Got a chance to visit this place with team. Such a superb place to Hangout. I recommend this place for parties,to watch cricket on big screen & have fun and best place to spend time with friends. The starters were too good, drinks are okay and biryani can be better...I know many people don't visit this place for biryani üòÖ

Ambiance:5/5
Quality:5/5
Quantity:3.5/5
Price:3/5 (not pocket friendly)
Service:3.5/5
Taste: 4.5/5"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ria Thakur,10 April 2019,3,"The ambience is very nice, the place has both indoor and outdoor setting. The staff is polite.
The food however didn't excite me much, the music was average and the rate fluctuations for drinks (the main concept of the place) seemed more static and less interesting.
The cocktails didn't taste that well either. We ordered a Chicken Noodles didn't taste as per the grandeur of the place. The biryani was good. We also ordered LITs which were not up to the mark at all."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ankita,07 April 2019,4,A good place to hangout. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating. Live matches on big screens are quite engaging. Starters are appreciable specially Tandoori Malai brocolli.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Aastha Singh,05 April 2019,2,Bad customer service! First we booked table near screen still they didn't give and they make people stand near screen! How the hell should we watch the match? People go to see match and they do this!
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Nebula,05 April 2019,1,"Although we booked our table, the suitable table couldnt be found for us. One guy passed to another one and we sat outside. After this they send inside. Finally the table was found for us.
We ordered J√§germeister and Baileys but we had nuts for the prices 375 and 450 (see the portion).
Ok I understand that prices are fluctuates, but we didn't know that we paid for this little shots. These drinks serves with proper glass with ices, BIGGER PORTIONS, THIS IS CHARGING.
Will never visit this place again!"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sai Pranathi,05 April 2019,4,"Good ambience
Nice outdoor seating
Good dancefloor
Average dj
Economical menu
Good customer service
Food is really tasty
Can visit for casual chilling"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Shiva Shandilya,04 April 2019,4,Nice place to hang out with your friends and family. Service is also very good. Best brewed beer in the city. A place with good ambience and good service. Must try
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sai Ram,04 April 2019,1,one of the worst service ever I recieved today. I don't wana refer anyone to this place. I contacted the lal street they told me about the happy hours menu and after going there tha menu has been totally changed i. e. from 1+1 to 99 and i didnt like this and worst ever service
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Akhil Kode,03 April 2019,4,"I was here to spend some special moment and I got satisfied with everything in here.
Very recommended place for #goout with buddies to have some special time.
I love the MRP night..üçª
#chillout #longnight"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Charu Gupta,03 April 2019,4,"This is one good pub that can make your evening.
Went for my birthday, the food is good and so are the drinks, made better by zomato 2+2.

The music was good and had a great time dancing to the numbers DJ was playing.

Overall you will be satisfied and would want to stay longer."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Kanika Gautam,02 April 2019,5,"Have been to this place...

Ambience - took up the seat in the outdoor area... loved the place and the music beats....

Service - staff person was Santosh. He was very efficient and courteous.

Food - ordered white sauce pasta, misal pav, bombay sandwich and drinks.

Misal pav is great but a suggestion here. Increase the quantity of misal in the plate. The taste was real good.

Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.

Bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..

Definitely must visit place.."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Aaina Sharma,02 April 2019,5,"I visited this place on last Saturday and I really enjoyed the evening. The best thing which I liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the Dancing floor which does not happen in Delhi . I really liked the food and the crowd, would love to visit again ."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Jahnavi Manem,02 April 2019,5,"The place will never get bored as it has peachy music and the taste of the food was soo yummy.We tried the chicken wings they were fab!!The adornment is very classy in a lofty way.Overrall a very good place to hangout with friends.

Service 4/5
Food 5/5
Price 5/5"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Siddhant Chopra,01 April 2019,4,"This place is something you can never get bored off, groovy music, good food and crowd is also nice üòã . The lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. It's very crowded on weekends like anything

Talking about the food this place is Zomato Gold Food partner. If you have it , you can enjoy the benefits
- Chicken Lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
- Masala Papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
- cheesy pineapple sticks (Never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(
- Paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)
- Chicken Tikka Masala (highly recommended)
- Cheese Garlic naan and butter Naan

Overall my evening at Lal was just amazing, the service was really good. You can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Vineet R,01 April 2019,2,"This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Akansha Gupta,31 March 2019,5,Amazing place on Weekends!! Must visit if you have crazy set of friends to dance with. I have been there several times and trust me it never disappoints me
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Bhuban Sa,31 March 2019,1,"Went to this place it is a nice place but customer service is not good, they accepted my table booking but later when I visit the place they did not allot me table u just have to hit the bar counter.

Note to manager- if u can't provide table just don't accept it."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Renu Rozera,31 March 2019,2,"Ambience was good.
But food, in taste and quality, was not up to the mark.
Also the service was poor. Waiters were not waiting properly, you had to call everytime for small things like glasses or plates."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Karthik Ivaturi,30 March 2019,4,I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The staff are friendly over all experience is ok. I liked the starters. It is ok with a group of 5 to be there
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Amruta Karve,30 March 2019,3,Good place to hangout. Its bit boring to order from apo though. üòê food is okay okay.. We had many different chicken n veg starters. DJ kept atmosphere Lively.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Anand Singla,29 March 2019,3,"The drinks were good, the food was mediocre, the service was pathetic.
The waiter asked us when are we leave, apparently they overbooked, and even the service was slow."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Radhika Burra,28 March 2019,5,"First of all special mention to Santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service. He was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast. Thank you Santosh for it.

Now coming to F&B, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. Every thing we ordered in Veg, Non Veg and Drinks (Mocktails) we're really good... Music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all I believe Wednesday is Ladies Night... So all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)

Overall... Very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always... Will go again for sure... Just waiting for a reason, if not will make one ... :-)"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rajsi Gaikwad,27 March 2019,4,"Even though this place is huge, we couldn't find a place to sit initially. Around 10.30 we finally got a place to sit. The food and the bar here is good and service was prompt (once you get a table). The DJ played some nice Bollywood songs. Overall it's a nice place but I'd recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sumit Agarwal,24 March 2019,3,"The DJ who plays at this place is really good. We went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot. On the downside, the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place.

The people on bar counter suck big time as they don't talk properly, give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ruchi Bavise,23 March 2019,3,"The Lal Street is been good for the first time. Today I went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.
Food was fine though but ambience is good."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ravishankar.upadhyayula,21 March 2019,5,Good place to hangout when you buddies and pals. Dj just turns on the dance floor. Place gets over crowded in weekends but the ambience makes you to stay and enjoy your drink.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rishab Singhal,19 March 2019,4,"What an ambience. It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place.
It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. We could order ourselves from the app.

The Lal Street (to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). 

In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)

If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. 

It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Bhargav Ram,18 March 2019,4,Awsme place for hangout wid frnds... And the joker poster was outstanding.. loved the place and service... The guy who served us also worked well...
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Nitish Kumar,18 March 2019,5,"This place is like home. Hindi Dj songs will take u to next level. Croud is so decent nd friendly.
Food is awesome specially loaded French fries.."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Ishank Kedia,17 March 2019,3,Looks interesting at the entrance and has an intriguing ambience. The food is good and staff is cooperative but less responsive. The seating arrangement is comfortable for a person to relax. The Paneer Kathi Roll is a must have!
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,4,"Good food options and decent service. Is expensive and dark ambience. During lunch time is not lively, though I expect evenings would be crowded."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Prashant Bahuguna,12 March 2019,4,"Gives you the millennial pub vibe. Nice ambience and food. The stock exchange theme always gives you a different and fun feel. The crowd is also good. One star is deducted for the service department, which I felt needs some improvement."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Astha Mishra,11 March 2019,4,"The best thing about TLS is it's dj. Dj played a good collection of songs, it has a separate dance floor which is a major plus point. The ambience is good, food is above average and service is prompt.
A good place for sat nights.."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Aditya Jha,11 March 2019,1,"The waiter here. Specially manager srini is worst and rude person here. Suggest never go to this place , they treat people as they are getting food for free."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Shaik Munna,10 March 2019,4,"Visited here Saturday evening, place was full crowded and it took time to get a table though I've booked online. Drinks prices keeps changing here as stock market exchange prices which is speciality of the bar. Dance floor, ambience, music everything is so good here."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sriram Arumilli,10 March 2019,4,"The pricing here will be an interesting one to see! The higher the drinks get sold, the more the price is. Ambience looks decent and the dance floor is big.
Starters menu is good, we had cheese balls and chicken started. The pricing seems to be expensive on Starters compared to other similar restaurants."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Taleens,10 March 2019,2,"Place was a complete let down. Was there for lunch on Sunday and was disappointed. The veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks. So unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place."
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Dian Shmilev,10 March 2019,3,"Great place, awesome music and great ambiance but waiters are unfriendly. Though I can recommend this place for the fun atmosphere and good music"
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Sukhpreet Singh,09 March 2019,5,Been here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was quite empty as it was afternoon. The starters n drinks are quite expensive but Zomato gold is applicable so it became quite reasonable as we were only 2 people. The Ceaser salad here is the best I had in the city.
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Triveni Arora,07 March 2019,4,Great ambience and their service was very good. Food was ok as I like less spicy and their food was very spicy. Liked that they too have bar exchange sort of thing. Enjoyed my visit. Must go atleast once.

AB's - Absolute Barbecues,Prachi Pant,22 May 2019,4,"Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!"

To be honest it didn't live up to the great reviews and great reputation it has.

Food spread is huge and too many varieties are there so a big thumsup for the same.

Quality of food is not wow but very average, prawn barbeque and chicken was very average.

Service is good and taken good care of.

Ambience was ok, it was feeling hot and we were sweating inside.

All in all a average ok experience."

Main coourse was very limited, i mean like common fr 700+ bucks dey provide less items. Dessert was good. Mexican fried icecrm was smething i tried fr d first tym but again the menu was limited and the quality of the cakes and pastries was very bad. My frnds nd me too could sense a foul smell as if it was nt fresh. Coming to the special items duck, rabbit squid, quail was on live and the chef cooked all the items in same way in same sauce. So i couldn't just feel the difference between all those special to be dishes. The place is nt properly built as i could smell the smoke of cooking and burning as well. Staff were very courteous and polite. Special mention to lassi and my favrte aam Panna was lit."

KFC,Atei Jenny Uo Chon,15 May 2019,1,No words very very very bad service I ever had. I wish this outlet would close forever. Staff??? Oh yeah staff they don't give a fuck to any customer. Because its a brand its KFC guys. Common no guys its KFC so one cares about review in zomato. Fuck this outlet.

KFC,Tathagat Verma,20 April 2019,3,"Decent ambience and setup. Lots of space, which is kind of expected, being a franchise.

Fast service, but inefficient. On multiple occasions they gave the wrong order."
KFC,GauTam SwaRoop,18 April 2019,1,"I had bad experiences at this place multiple times. The management has no sense of customer experience. The people working there dont even respond to customers properly. While ordering, they don't check the inventory. We had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that, there were some items missing. When asked how long it would take, they just responded vaguely. Iam not planning on visiting this place ever again."
KFC,Towheed Moneeb,11 April 2019,3,"It was team outing party. Ambiance was great
The food was good and the service was too slow. The main thing staff was very polite and smile face. Over all rating 2.9*....üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÑ"
KFC,Yoga,07 April 2019,4,I have ordered from here using the Zomato app. The ordering was simple. They responded very fast and I had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order. This was a happy experience. The burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent. The rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less.
KFC,Jalaj Arora,31 March 2019,2,Service is very slow. Took more than 15 minutes to prepare the order and still the food was cold. KFC quality has also gone down. Chicken was just okayish. Even AC is not working at the restaurant in peak summer time.
KFC,Gsvvenna99,27 March 2019,1,"I have ordered zinger box meal, the chicken inside is raw for the piece and the burger. I Don't recommend that this KFC is hygiene in cooking."
KFC,Riz & Shanky,27 March 2019,1,"Don't know what is going wrong with KFC as a brand , they are doing it wrong in every aspect! No proper management of customers on the counters, the food they are serving is not upto the mark as it used to be. I was a fan of KFC, but slowly I am loosing interest in going. I had a very bad experience. The coke they served was very sweet without any soda in it , I though I was having a sweet water. The chicken was not served hot. The quality of the rice they are providing is going down day by day!

Management please look into this, or else you will be loosing a lot of patrons. It's high time to think!"
KFC,Harish Donkada,25 March 2019,1,"on March 20th 2019, I've ordered 3 8 piece Smoky Grilled, which is worth of 1,857 rupees through Zomato. Instead of getting three 3 8 piece order, i was only given 2 8 piece order and 1 Hot crispy. I've called the customer care and i was assured call back. But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits. I would really not recommend orders from this place, as the customer treatment is pathetic. Since this is a corporate order, i strongly recommend my Food committee not to order anything from KFC in bulk."

KFC,Rohit Rao,29 November 2018,3,"Nothing bad, nothing good. Just there. Service is just as expected. Hygienic as should be. Orders are taken good.

KFC,Prakhar Megotia,07 October 2018,1,Both the zomato and kfc are cheating employees. Since order is placed on zomato app and delivered by kfc people none of them is willing to take responsibility even when the order is not delivered for two hours.

My personal fav is the zinger box which has a chicken zinger, hashbrown, 2 pieces of chicken and coke worth 200bucks"

We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good.
KFC,Vidya Reddy,10 August 2018,1,"Worst ever KFC lunch. I was a great fan of KFC and always liked to have it. But now I have decided to not to eat KFC anymore. Chicken is more like RUBBER.

I like Zinger burger a lot.  They now introduced a new krunchy Zinger burger (didn't try it as yet).
Their choices of krushers is good.  Tried the blue flavoured one.

Overall its a good store to come with friends and have quality KFC food."

The store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..

Staff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to üçî burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..

But over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes

Keep going good guys.. See u again"
KFC,Vidyadhari Muppala,23 July 2018,2,not properly fried
NorFest - The Dhaba,Navneet Singh,22 May 2019,4,So far the best kadhi chawal I have had in Hyderabad. Veg thalis here are amazing. And paneer lababdar is just finger licking. You don't have to think twice to place an order from this place.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Jayashree Sivakumar,11 May 2019,5,Best north indian food in town. The flavours were very well seasoned and we were very much satisfied with the reasonable pricing as well. Ordered naans and combos and it was given in fair quantity in relation to the prices. Would love to go again.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Abhinav Kulshrestha,06 May 2019,5,"One line review ""Great food!!"".
There is just something about the taste that brings that Delhite essence in the food.
Staff is also nice and thier playlist is great."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ravikumar Rudraraju,25 April 2019,3,I have ordered lucknawi chicken pulao..good amount of chicken .. delivered hot..but the food is so spicy that I was Unable to enjoy the taste
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ajit Kumar,25 April 2019,5,Are you bored taking North Indian foods from South Indian restaurant? Then you must try the limited yet handcrafted North Indian cuisines in Norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city. I strongly recommend to all the city dwellers to stop by through this unique chain at affordable price with premium quality service. Must try- Makki Di Roti and Sarson da saag. I still feel those mellowing taste of this dish.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Parul Chaudhary,15 April 2019,4,"Norfest!! Northern food feat!

Serves well to it‚Äôs name. The large menu catering to all needs of group and individual combos.

Food suggestion - Dal makkhani is a MUST! Everything on the menu is great.. a treat for both vegetarians and non - vegetarians! Very soft and fresh food.


Great for deliveries, order it at home or at work ‚ò∫Ô∏è

When looking for a yummmm North Indian food reach out to norfest!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Jay Mehta,31 March 2019,4,"review no 2. With delivery

Ordered again, mix veg this time , looked ok but tasted far better, was dry for a curry but serving of veggies was plenty. Just for dryness reducing 1* . I absolutely love this place , hope for better experience nect time

Review 1
Second time for this place but first time got it delivered! Had ordered paneer butter masala and mix veg..great quantity and quality...this place is amazing for north indian foood. I am glad zomato is now bringing it to vihanga area. Will be frequently ordering from here. Nothing to complain about best north indian food to order"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ravi Prakash,31 March 2019,3,"Recently went there to eat paranthas. It needs a lot of improvement. Earlier i had other non veg dishes on online order, which were good. Ambience is good."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Mitali Agrawal,22 March 2019,4,"I just loved it. Good food at reasonable price.
Paneer lababdar & daal makhni from this place is very good. I also tried aloo kulcha and it was also good though the chole served with kulcha need to be improved."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Amar,17 March 2019,4,"I've only tried vegetarian food as take away from here. Dal Makhani is a must try ! Tried Kadai paneer couple of times.It's subtle and flavorful.
The Malai Kofta gravy is more on the sweeter side..."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Priti Singh,15 March 2019,1,"I ordered food here.but one guy called me nd said food is not available. Restaurant guy called me nd declined the order. If food was not available ,you should not taken the order."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ashima Saxena,14 March 2019,1,I ordered Lucknowi veg galouti kebab and paratha through ZOMATO but the quality of the kebab needs some serious improvement and were very oily too.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Vaishakhi R Kamath,14 March 2019,5,Ordered Paneer Makhani from NorFest and I would mark it to be the finest Paneer Makhani that I've ever had.. the paneer was soft and the gravy was just so amazing. The dish was made to meet utmost perfection and I recommend it as well .
NorFest - The Dhaba,Shashi Saini,06 March 2019,5,"In Simple lines ""Good Thing Comes In Small Packages"" . People who love a authentic north indian / Desi Type , this is the place to visit.  Remember this is a Eat Out in a Shopping mall not a restaurant.

Price are reasonable. They have kept there menu Simple, not like in restaurant having menu books where you struggle to order.  I tried both veg and non veg [ starters and main course ] , after having a bite i had to appreciate  ""it's good""."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Piyush Rangani,05 March 2019,5,Its my all time favourite.. mutton galuati kabab and paneer mirch wala are my favourite.. also one can taste shikanji/jaljeera here which is awesome..
NorFest - The Dhaba,Nitin Bhapkar,27 February 2019,5,Amritsari Kulcha and chole is MUST try at this restaurant. Located in happening place yet economical option which provides value for money. Portion size is really good and recommended to carefully order to avoid wastage
NorFest - The Dhaba,Atanu Ray,24 February 2019,3,"Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest - The Dhaba. I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs. 400. However, very disappointed with the quantity of food. At that price range they are not providing a proper portion . Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . I gave three star only for the quality ."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Pratikr,20 February 2019,1,i ordered punjabi chicken and my experience was horrible. Such a costly thing of rs 300 and such less quantity that hardly one person can eat. The food too was not fresh and was stale and was smelling. had to throw it away and neither zomato nor these ppl lsitened to any queries. I wud suggest not to order from here as u can easily get at this price from good restaurants
NorFest - The Dhaba,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,15 February 2019,4,A really good meal at a reasonable price. The quantity was perfect. Not a lot and not too less. I ordered the paneer combo and shikanji . Norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials. Looking at the box itself I started feeling more hungry. The only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji. It was not something that you could brag about.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Kankana Sengupta,11 February 2019,5,Greeted warmly with experienced people explaining the various dishes available. One of the best places in town if you are searching for some really tasty food. Loved the taste specially the butter chicken. üòãüòã Will definitely recommend my friends.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Lina Moolani,02 February 2019,4,"This is opened up in SLN terminals and visitied during lunch time, its a shop in a food court so no ambience as such.
Their paneer combo is a must try, dal makhani was really good. Another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole - kulcha was good but chole can be made better. overall a must go to place for the northside taste."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Parijat Ray,31 January 2019,4,A must try place for north indian food lovers. The kebab items are highly recommended. The only problem is it is a part of a food court. The items are decently priced and very tasty.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Riha Dhawan,23 January 2019,4,"Finally someone can make food which I could call North Indian. Amazing place to have a typical north Indian types brunch or dinner. Only con I would prefer if they did had a proper place too.

Definitely visiting again."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Lokesh Gupta,21 January 2019,1,"*Fake Rating* !!Beware!!


We ordered galouti kabab and dhaba chicken... both were pathetic and nowhere close to the name of the dish.. orange galouti kabab with yellow paratha...dhaba chicken‚Äôs gravy tasted like toor daal"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Akash Dudi,21 January 2019,4,Food was very tasty but a bit costly.specially their world famous kheer you should try. Starters were amazing. You can try thali here so that you taste everything.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sumit Kumar Jha,19 January 2019,4,"Punjabi thali is awesome. Dal Makhani, Mix Veg., and Mushroom is recommended. However, cost can be reduced a bit, in particular, of the thalis."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Swapna Kulkarni,16 January 2019,3,"Last time I ordered mutton rogan josh from here, it was amazing but today it was not fresh and only bones, no meat. It‚Äôs sad my favourite restaurant is going down in quality"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Vivek Jain,04 January 2019,3,"The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.

VFM: 4/5
Taste: 3/5"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Anamay Tamrakar (Aman),29 December 2018,4,"Good North Indian Food. I ordered from them a couple of times. Haven't visited the restaurant though, so can't talk abt the experience. The food is good."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Gaurav Agrawal,23 December 2018,4,Giving satisfaction to hunger and brings in value for money. Cannot get tired of ordering food from the restaurant. #awesome #fabulous #feedthehunger
NorFest - The Dhaba,Punit Kanuga,20 December 2018,3,"Ordered mix veg and tandoori rotis. Curry was tasty. However, I felt it had too much of beans. Overall, a good experience. I can order this again."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Atul Kumar Kushwaha,10 December 2018,4,Good taste and best place with special thalis. Complete punjabi taste with chaachh. One of the good punjabi taste in hyderabad. A must go at least once.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Luck@chance,05 December 2018,5,"I am shocked and I ever had in my life food taste like this in th any common food court of India it was my 2nd visit in 2 days, M impressed by veg Galaouti kabab what a flavour , smoothness, textures, binding, combination of paratha , now I am a big fan of Norfest.. it's simply located in food court no necessary and unessary interior, simple and fresh, love the food.

We order something like jaljeera green ... 5*
Lassi salted 5*
Veg Galaouti 5* 6* 10* 100* I just love this
Non veg Galaouti 5*
Kheer 4* feel little thin...
Love the food keep it guys I wish you good luck.

Highly recommended for North food lover

NorFest - The Dhaba,Malay Pande,02 December 2018,3,"I hv been away from Hyderabad from a year ...on coming back ...my brother told me about the dalnmakhni from this place .....he said it was amazing .......
I ordered a couple of items along with dal makhni ......no doubt the dal makhni was nice but it can't be compared to d Delhi dal makhni ...

The menu is very crisp .....overall the food is really nice .....I would rate this place a 3.5 ...."
NorFest - The Dhaba,FAIZ REHMAN,18 November 2018,5,"By far, one of the best restaurant for North Indian Cuisine. It is our go to outlet for ordering food. The Thalis are really fabulous(Both veg and non-veg) . The quantity is more than sufficient for one person and quality has been really consistent!
They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Anand Prabhala,13 November 2018,5,Best place for authentic drool-worthy north Indian food. Reasonably priced and great ambience. The Dal Makhani was definitely the best I have had in Hyderabad.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Haindavi Dandu,13 November 2018,5,"Being a veggie... It gets difficult to find good vegetarian food, but every time i have food from this place, its really good. I wonder how they are able to maintain consistency both in terms of quality and quantity every single time.

Overall review: Best place for north indian food!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sunny Bhasin,13 November 2018,4,"Place is good. Taste is also good but not the best. kebabs were nice except the galawati kebab it was not as good as lucknow one. The portions were quite small.
Service is fast."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Arvind Ramachander ( Fb.com/Sooperclicks ),13 November 2018,4,"Lunch at Norfest, Gachibowli.
I'm a big fan of this place and love their combos.
Ordered their Veg. Galouti Kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
Was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

Then came the Veg. Combo - Had 2 butter rotis with Mixed Veg curry (Corn, carrot, Peas, capsicum, potato, Aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
Absolutely loved the mixed Veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani üòÅ with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless üòä

Norfest is now operational in PVR Galleria, Punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location üòä

Their Paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Aditi Gupta,29 October 2018,3,"#Heavy Punjabi Food
A perfect place to savor typical Dhaba style Punjabi Dishes. 
A popular outlet for home delivery, however place has common food court space available for dine-in as well. 
Food was served hot and tastes yumm.
Chola masala : Paneer was dominating the quantity of Chola."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Bhavi Solanki,28 October 2018,5,"Suggested by one my best friend, this place is on fire when it comes to taste North Indian Food! 

What we Ordered : Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Veg Combo & Paneer Combo with a Sweet Lassi.

Must Say, the Dishes were so damn yummy! Being in Hyderabad, I was missing good Punjabi Food and so was this place came to the rescue. Superb Taste specially the Paneer Sabji & the Amritsari Buttery Kulcha! 

The Food Court is well ambient and had a great Time!

Must visit if one misses North Indian Food!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sam,28 October 2018,1,"Was served very bad quality of chicken, even for the second time. They mixed kebab chicken in butter chicken and 2 to 3 varieties of chicken were mixed and chicken is half cooked and had a very bad smell"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Saurabhdugar01,14 October 2018,1,After so much of appreciations was tempted for a punjabi thali And have ordered the same. But the wait was not worth it. Dal was flavoured with colours and paneer was not at all delicious and soft. Wont recommend for a vegetarian punjabi thali.
NorFest - The Dhaba,G. Sushmitha Reddy,11 October 2018,3,"They definitely promise you a decent meal.

Known for their timely delivery and packaging norfest doesn't disappoint you.

üçóNonveg starter platter is more than enough for two people. Perfectly cooked two pieces of Tangdi kebab, malai kebab and angara kebab might not leave a lasting impression but in general they are well marinated and taste good.

üç± Punjabi Non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from saladü•ó to raita.

üçõ In a non-veg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani. Wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps. Felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency.

ü•òButter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies(‚úîÔ∏è).

üç™Butter rotis were hard and tough to tear - the usual packaging side effects.

ü•£Boondi raita definitely needs a mention for it's delicious texture and taste and so the rice kheer."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Naveen Jain,09 October 2018,5,"What a place to eat! We were more than overwhelmed looking at the Quantity and awesome taste of authentic North India. Ordered Rajma Rice, Amritsari Kulccha with Chhole, Paneer, Daal Makhni, Tandoori Roti, and each and every bit of it was scrumptious. Though we couldn't find our friend, Pratik, there (owner of the place), we were well off enjoying our food rather than a chit chat :-D
Thanks for such a great offering!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Surya,07 October 2018,1,"Ordered today veg thali via Uber eats. Was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. On the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. Below item wise feedback:
Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

Hope you take some action on this and not to cheat customers with the name of authentic punjabi with some nice reviews"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Upender Uniyal,05 October 2018,5,Had the best dal makhani and butter chicken at this place in Hyderabad. Located in SLN terminus.. on 3rd floor.. Not a big place but they serve amazing punjabi food at reasonable prices.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Kiran Kumar,01 October 2018,3,"Had been to this place for dinner we ordered fallout I kebab for starters that was quiet decent.For main course we ordered dal makhni,butter chicken,paneer lababdar and lacha paratha.Dal makhni was good and even their butter chicken was tasty with lacha paratha.But their lababdar was not authentic.Finished with sweet lassi again was not that great.Overall good food."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Suchata Biswas,26 September 2018,4,Food is The USP. All i tasted there was great. But my favourite is the punjabi butter chicken with bone.. such aroma n taste( m salivating while writing even) the only thing is i feel it‚Äôs a little burn in the pocket.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Pallavi Srivastava,20 September 2018,5,"Food was delicious and the service of Rakesh , Rangadhar and Chinmoy was very good. After food, they served us with pan with no additional cost. That really delighted us."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Hitakshi.21,20 September 2018,5,"Amazing food. Probably the best North Indian food in Hyderabad. Loved the rajma chawal, kadi chawala and their Dal makhani.
Saviour for North Indians"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Gondi Kavinder Reddy,15 September 2018,1,"After reading some good reviews went to this place by some search to reach this place. Ordered Punjabi non veg spl thali and amruthsari kulcha with chole. 
I wondered by looking the quantity of items. They are very small quantity. 
Taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. In non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. VFM 1/5.  
They are not providing drinking water. A eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
I have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Rubin S Cherian,12 September 2018,4,"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

Food: 4.5/5
Ambience: 4/5 (food court setup)
Service: 3.5/5
VFM: 3.5/5 (a tad expensive, but probably justified by the quality and taste of the food)"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Madhuri Puramsetti,09 September 2018,5,"Good food, great service... Been coming here since years and the best thing is that it's always been stable with the food quality & service... Good place to hangout... Love it üòä"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sneha,08 September 2018,5,"Great place, awesome ambience and amazing North Indian food. The most go-to place to satisfy your North Indian taste buds! 10/10 value for money. Last but not the least, quick and prompt service."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Nirbhay Anand,08 September 2018,5,"One of my favourite place to visit all the time, I feel like home there, best part of this place is self and easy going service which attracted me a lot. My fav dish there butter milk, gauloti kebab, mutton Rogan Josh. People are amazing there, every one must try."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Asha Dalmia,01 September 2018,5,This place is awesome. I ate a kulcha here it was awesome making me happy. It was cheap and best. I give 5 plus stars. We ate for around 1200 but we didn't get to know that it was so cheap.
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ramesh Menon,23 August 2018,5,"Best Punjabi food I have come across in Hyderabad so far.
Called for Non Veg Kebab combo ..

Kebab Pieces - proper leg pieces of chicken marinated in juices of masala served with coriander chutney is damn good.

Garlic Naan - garlic and stretchy soft naans was pretty good.

Dal Makhani - Had such a good dal makhani , creamy and flavoursome. It made my day."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Gaurav,16 August 2018,5,"Would you like to feast on North Indian food in Hyderabad? Are you a foodie or die hard fan of butter chicken? Go or order from NorFest, I was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when I ordered from this place. Big fan of them, tried their all outlet and I must say good pricing with awesome taste (Without curry leaves :)))) in Hyderabad (No Offence to south indian  food).
Best part is that it will not hurt your wallet badly if you compare with Dhaba etd 1956 or other so called north indian restaurant."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Lakshmi P,12 August 2018,4,"Ordered the Punjabi Thali for lunch. It was amazing. The quantity is perfect and the food was really delicious.
The thali had 2 rotis, paneer butter masala, dal makhani, mix veg, mint chutney, raita, steamed rice, salad and a dessert.
The packing was really good and the rate is pocket friendly.
A must try."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ankit Kumar,06 August 2018,4,"Description of this place says authentic Punjabi food, and their food corroborates this very well. we ordered their North Indian special thali a few days back. 
The packaging was good and spillproof and looked appetizing. 
It had 2 vegetable dishes, one paneer, and one dal, along with zeera rice and 2 butter naan. and green mint chutney and A sweet dessert to end the meal with. The quantity was more than sufficient for one person.  Each item was very tasty and Kheer as dessert was the best of all. 
It was decently priced and if combined with any offer of zomato its just great deal. 

Food - 4/5 
Packaging - 5/5 
Delivery - 4/5 

Overall a very good experience."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Richy Alex George,04 August 2018,5,That taste of mutton Galouti kabab oh my god!!! Soo yum it just melt down in you mouth I just loved and recommend others to try it with lassi . So happy we could get at least this dish in Hyderabad
NorFest - The Dhaba,Kalyan Madduru,03 August 2018,3,"Located on top floor of SLN TERMINUS , in one of the food court's corner, norfest dhaba has well arranged menu and delivery to table unlike other stalls there. Ambience was good, went on a weekday, very less crowded. Ordered special veg dum pulao. Rice was well cooked, didn't find lot of veggies though. Masala levels were good that adds spicyness. Can give it a try for 180+ bucks."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Prasant Sekar,02 August 2018,5,I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could‚Äôve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you‚Äôll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!
NorFest - The Dhaba,Fit Foodie,27 July 2018,4,"Have been to this place and also ordered from here. This place serves one of the best Awadhi and Punjabi dishes in Hyderabad. This is located in the food court of SLN Terminus mall. Loved their butter chicken which went really well with Tandoori Roti. Galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served.

Ordered Lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as Chicken today. Portion size for both was a little on the lower side. The flavors and taste were awesome. As soon as the food was in the house we could smell Awadhi cooking. They serve Boondi Raita with the pulao, this is a welcome break from the onion - tomato Raita that usually comes with Biryani.

Food - 4.5
VFM - 3.5
Ambience - 3
Packing - Good
Delivery Time - Quick"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Roohi Najiya,24 July 2018,4,"‚ö´Ô∏è This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
‚Çπ269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èKadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èDum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èBundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ‚ù£ I think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èRice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èButter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSalad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èKheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

NorFest - The Dhaba,Shreyoshi Mandal,23 July 2018,2,"Okay to begin with, a 4.3 rated place in food court sounded quite fishy to me. So I was expecting a big bang surprise with their food. I had Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Sweet Lassi and Shikanji.
First, coming to the people who spoke about ""Authentic Punjabi"" food in reviews, guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit Punjab and eat there!
Shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal, Lassi was the worst one I have had lately. The Amritsari Kulcha and Chole was tasteless. The dollop of ""Butter"" didnt taste as it was meant to.
Overall a very disappointing experience."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Hny Juneja,14 July 2018,5,"a must visit for great North Indian food, relish on the veg n non veg starter platter, much delicious dal makhni n paneer curries n value for money is cherry on the cake, totally recommended"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Jaspreet Kaur,13 July 2018,5,Awesome North Indian punjabi food served here at reasonable price
NorFest - The Dhaba,Supraja.prasad,12 July 2018,4,"Authentic punjabi khana in the Gachibowli area. Their rajma chawal , dhaba chicken and thalis are very good. Their Pudina paratha and Amritsari kulcha are very yummy. Dal makhani is very heavy. The kheer is a must try in the deserts. The seating is limited as it‚Äôs in food court but service is fast. Even home delivery packing is very good."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ashok Choudhary,12 July 2018,4,"I never been to this place but recently ordered Veg combo , Punjabi Nonveg combo and curries.
Dal makhani is mouth watering and other items included in combos are also yum."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sunil Sistla,10 July 2018,3,"veg pulav, kadai paneer, garlic Naan.
Pulav is not properly cooked. Looks colorful but tasteless. The gravy is too sweet. Naan I could see the uncooked dough."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Jaya Narang,10 July 2018,4,"This is Delhi/North India for me on a platter! Good paranthas, awesome rajma-chawal and butter chicken.. Definitely a must try..love this place"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Varun,08 July 2018,4,"Have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.

They serve pretty good authentic North Indian food. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni are top notch. Very flavorful and authentic.

Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti‚Äòs were invented.

And the mutton Galaouti‚Äôs served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

Pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50% discount too over Uber eats.So, if u have a thing for North Indian cuisine it's a nice place to go."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Ramu Bhattathiri,04 July 2018,3,"Loved the service, although their other outlet in Madhapur has more seating available, this place is going to be worth when you visit in a group of 4-5 people. :)"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Avin Seth,03 July 2018,4,"One of my favs for north india food in Hyderabad and within budget. The veg galauti kababs, amritsari kulcha with chole adds to the punjabi food. A nice small outlet in SLN terminus food court, run by punjabis and hence the punjabi taste in the food is what makes my inner punjabi come out and relish the cusine at this place.

Guys open more outlets in Hyderabad its would be a great success.

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Akshay Tebriwal,02 July 2018,4,"Amazing food.... Anyone who wants to have delicious finger licking Punjabi food, must visit.

At this place they are like an outlet rather than a restaurant so it might feel a bit uncomfortable but there food will make you forget all complaints."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Gourmet Keen,30 June 2018,4,"I strongly recommend ""Punjabi Butter Chicken"" (bone or boneless) with Naan (any type)....this is the only item I order here...which is deliciously tasty.

Tried Veg Dum Pulao, and Lassi also, nope...I can't even rate these items, they should remove these items from there menu.

For me, this dhaba is brand ambassador for ""Punjabi Butter Chicken"" :-)"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Rohit Reddy,30 June 2018,5,"Been here to this place many a times till now and it has never disappointed. I have also ordered food online from here many times. Whenever I am hungry and I want to eat good Punjabi Food, this has been my go-to place in gachibowli. Recently a second outlet was opened in madhapur also.
I have tasted almost every item here, like paneer butter masala, matar mushroom, Dal makhni, Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Lucknowi chicken dum pulav, murgh tikka masala, Punjabi special veg / non-veg Thali, rajma chawal etc.,
My best picks are matar mushroom, paneer butter masala, Punjabi special veg Thali, punjabi butter chicken to name a few.
I was disappointed with the Rajma chawal though.

The best thing about this place is its consistency in taste which it maintains.
Overall it was a great experience and I would rate this as 4.5/5 for its food."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Shivam Khandelwal,29 June 2018,5,"Best food spot located in SLN Terminus. The food quality is great, although some dishes were bit sweeter than I expected. 
Have ordered multiple times both online and being there. I will totally recommend Dal Makhani and Rajma from this place. Lassi is <3 as well.

Service : 5/5
Place: 4/5
Food: 5/5
Value for money : 5/5"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Madhav,29 June 2018,5,"Food is worth the hype! Expect a crowd.

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I‚Äôd complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Anushka Singh,28 June 2018,5,"Awesome. Dilli ki yaad aa gayi food.

There chole kulche is love. And even the other dishes. It‚Äôs a good option to even home deliver as the seating isn‚Äôt great."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Richa Gulati,27 June 2018,5,The best North Indian food available in Hyderabad specially dal makhani and the mouthwatering galhouti kabab.. they are to die for! It's a must must try when you are in Hyderabad and craving for good North Indian foodüòä
NorFest - The Dhaba,Mohit Bhagchandani,26 June 2018,5,"The best place for having authentic north indian food. Amritsari kulcha with chole, butter naan with dal makhani..you won't find it better than here. The galouti kebabs were too yummy and had the typical 'melt in mouth' functionality."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Vamsi Krishna C V,25 June 2018,4,"Had the panneer of the day combo here. It was matar panner,Dal makhani. Needless to say one of the best cooked dal makhani and matar paneer i ever tasted. It was a bit pricey but the taste was totally worth it. Norfest has set a new bench mark for how dal makhani and panneer dishes are to be made.

The only thing i can complain about is the quantity. For 240 I felt that what i had on my plate was really less."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Naimish Chandarana,24 June 2018,4,"This place is part of the food court in SLN terminus. They maintain proper hygiene and service is also good.

Coming to the food, we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry, rice, dal makhni and 2 roti. Quantity is sufficient for 1 person. The best part of the meal was their dal makhni. it was just wow. paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka.

I also had amritsari kulcha with chole. It was good in taste. Also, tried their lassi and sikanji. lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite. It was not refreshing as it should be.

Overall, we had nice experience, and recommendable place to have food in SLN terminus.

Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more food fun.."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Rakshita Nath,23 June 2018,4,"Must visit place.
Go there for a great food experience. Paradise for North Indians. This place needs multiple visits for tasting the entire menu and shikanji is a must try.
Loved it for the food
Do visit
Cheers with Avin Seth"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Anshul Jain,22 June 2018,4,"This review is for online order.

Ordered Punjabi spcl Veg Thali & Rajma Chawal through Uber eats. Received generous 50% off.

Packaging of thali was very good which didn't cause any spillage or mixing of curries.

All the items were good in taste having medium spices. Kheer was the highlight of thali having perfect sweetness and flavors of saffron was amazing.

Rajma chawal was also great."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sneha Das,19 June 2018,5,"I love this place and keep coming back here. Problem is, I am pregnant and I get norfest food pangs and for whatever reason you guys have stopped taking home delivery orders. I live at Lanco hills, manikonda and the food delivery does not deliver here. As a request from a pregnant lady who loves your food especially the Dal Makhani, can this be looked into?"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sudip,17 June 2018,5,Best place to get great food. I have been there more than 60 times in last two year.. but still in love.. would recommend Dal Makhani ... awesome taste...must try..
NorFest - The Dhaba,Vatsal Jain,14 June 2018,5,"The food was a treat to my taste buds... Just amazing food. Ordered:
Achari Paneer Tikka

Must visit for every North India in HYD.!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Pooja Singh,12 June 2018,5,"Absolutely yummy food!have been visiting this place for quite a sometime now and just love it!
Dal makhni is a proper North Indian one and made me a big fan!service is top notch.always a good place to grab a bite of after tiring shopping at spar!"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Yeshaswi Kondapally,01 June 2018,5,"well , what should i say, i mean i have been dying for authentic north Indian food for so long and here i am enjoying the flavors of north . thank you guys for your wonderful food and lassi üòÄüòÅüòÅüòäüòä"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Arushi Jain,31 May 2018,4,"One of the best place to have punjabi food. We ordered:
Dal Makhni: It is the best dal makhni I had in hyderabad with a proper punjabi flavour.
Dal Tadka: Loved it. Not very oily and perfect taste.
Garlic Naan: Good"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Sakshi Garg,31 May 2018,4,"It's serves one of the best punjabi food in hyderabad, the galouti kabab will melt in your mouth as soon as you will eat it.
The deserts are not good though but still it will remind you of northe indian taste."
NorFest - The Dhaba,Daenarys,30 May 2018,5,"The spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal, including me, set about while writing a review, scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had.
On such a rare occasion, i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this.
Since the time i shifted to Hyderabad, i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant.
Spicy, hot and tangy became a common thing. And here comes Norfest, like a strong and quiet gallant hero, who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon.

The mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where, street food sellers scream in the humid heat, ushering people to come in to their food haven. It was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again. The nuts on top were a nice touch.

We also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and I, a slow eater, finished it in seconds. I still remember the taste in my mouth, tandoori chicken, soft and creamy gravy with warm rice.
The dal makhani, i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken, but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added.
I, a pure non vegetarian, became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums, carrots and corn. The gravy enveloping it was amazing.
The thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it.
The kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip.
It was sweet, the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch.
Talking about it, i am definitely reordering it tomorrow. Kudos"
NorFest - The Dhaba,Abhishek Gupta,27 May 2018,4,"Bit pricy as compared to the location. Tasty authentic North Indian food. Amritsari Kulcha chole must try, little spicy but North Indian food would go that way. Friendly staff, served on table. Limited menu items."
Hotel Zara Hi-Fi,Harsha Vardhan,25 May 2019,1,Terrible. Chicken masala curry had only 1 piece which was about one inch square on the bone. Extremely hot...cant taste any major spiced except loaded red chilly. Gave me gas for a good 30 mins.

Hotel Zara Hi-Fi,Dheeraj,23 February 2019,1,Almost 20 of my friends had vomited the food within a couple of hours after eating. The price of the items is cheap so is the quality of food.

Hotel Zara Hi-Fi,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,08 February 2019,1,"I am wondering how this restaurant has a 3.5 rating.

Ordered shahi paneer thinking it's the safest bet. The curry even looked disgusting. It was too oily and didnt taste like shahi paneer. I could only eat the paneer pieces. Thankfully they were soft.

Hotel Zara Hi-Fi,BhavaniSankar Nakka,27 October 2018,2,Chicken Biryani taste is good but the quality of chicken of is degrading day by day.

talking about food, only good thing was lasagna other than that we ordered veg Platter and lasagna rolls which were really bad in taste. dj was not too good"
10 Downing Street,Jayaprakash Reddy,21 May 2019,4,"I have visited this pub last weekend with group of friends, we had brewed beers, veg & non-veg starters. Food tastes good, prices are reasonable, ambience is decent, service is good even though it‚Äôs on Saturday night.

Overall i liked the place, I will visit again!!"
10 Downing Street,Ram K,19 May 2019,4,"Surely one of the best lasagna you can have. The place never disappoints you even when you are just trying something for the first time here. Chilli cheese toast is something you have to try .

Great food at budget price with good service in a lovely ambience.
What more can you ask for...."
10 Downing Street,Shruthi Ayalasomayajula,11 May 2019,5,"Closed ambiance, loud. Food was filling, we ordered veg platter and the pizza is a must try, thin crust with a good amount of cheese, if you're a cheese lover do try it.
Ambience- 4.5/5
Service-4/5
Food-5/5"
10 Downing Street,Bhargavi Vasudha Anantatmula,11 May 2019,4,It was great experience . You will find crowd mostly on Friday and Saturday dance floor is not that great. Pricing was normal. You can enjoy with family too.
10 Downing Street,Rmandava70,09 May 2019,4,Place is awesome so their craft beers. Liked Belgian Wit and Belgian Strong Ale. Both are amazing. Food taste and quality is good. They must improve a bit on quantity. After all they are charging good price for food. Lot to improve in service. They are not vigilant about customer needs. No cutlery was kept on the table until repeatedly asked for it. Overall it is a good experience.
10 Downing Street,K Prakash Raju,05 May 2019,1,"I came there with my friend as stags. It was written stags are allowed till 8 pm but the reception person was unkind to say ‚Äúyou are not allowed ‚Äú at 7:45. He was looking down on us just cause there was no girl. The other point that he raised was that my friend was not wearing shoes. It looked reasonable.
Overall, it felt humiliating and I felt it wasn‚Äôt a decent place to even receive you."
10 Downing Street,Anjali Lal,05 May 2019,1,Most terrible place. I used to love Chennai 10D And with that brand I went to Hyd 10D. Firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats. Could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge. We stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one couldn't even talk! And then the waiters weren't serving us food properly. Had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they didn't give us cutlery. Can you even imagine??? I had to ask that give forks !!!!!!! I had the worst experience ever of going to a place. Extremely disappointed. Please learn how to manage a crowd. Also I wanted to book my table beforehand. But the option was not even available on Zomato and they won't pick up call. It just felt they didn't want things to be systematic. Extremely disappointed.
10 Downing Street,Meenakshi Patel,05 May 2019,1,"Reading the reviews we visited this place, however our experience was not good. We were not offered our preferred seat even when most of the tables were empty and unreserved. Few of the staff members were rude and rigid and the food was fine."
10 Downing Street,Asimeni Bhavya,05 May 2019,4,"I had chosen this place for a weekend to spend quality time with my friends, overall can giving ratings for:
Ambiance - 10/10
Food - 5/10
Music- 5/10"
10 Downing Street,Dinesh Naidu,03 May 2019,4,"An Uber cool place with an ambience which reminds you of any pub in London well isn‚Äôt the name making it obvious. Been here couple of times, place outside on terrace gets filled up faster than inside,they now have water sprays outside to keep you cool in summers.

This is a brewery but again not all beers in the menu are available most of the time. Although the home beer is good. Must try.

Food is okay, can be better.

Overall 4/5
Ambience 5/5
Food 3/5
Service 3.5/5"
10 Downing Street,Vidya Bharti (Traod_thefoodietraveller),02 May 2019,4,"Good food good ambience at less price...!! What else neededü§òüèª

So you get food with drink combo ....for my two orders mentioned above it cost me 280/- each which is amazing....üëçüèª"
10 Downing Street,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,4,"This place is sooo good in everything food, ambiance,drinks and what not. But the main problem is again I am a stag for most of the times so couldnt enter majority of the evenings :(, else it would have been 5 star.
Totally worth the visit"
10 Downing Street,Jitu Prakash Rout,29 April 2019,5,i order Mexican veg salad what dressing giving i Don't no but this is not good very bad proper dressing is olive oil & mustard sauce but giving me tomoto sauce dressing services is good bikash shoo you gave good beer was a very good beer thanks for bikash but ambience is good
10 Downing Street,Shashank N,28 April 2019,3,"This is a good place to hang out.The ambience is really good . One of the best chicken nachos I have had till date but the crispy chicken disappointed. They Do not have a big list of beers being brewed and the is not that great when compared with other brews in hyderabad.
Would recommend this place if you are someone who likes virgin pinnocolada"
10 Downing Street,Navdeep Kohli,28 April 2019,4,"Located on the 10th floor of SNL mall , this place is one of the most Hip party places in Gachibowli.
The ambience is good and the place is huge as well..
Food is also good and service is again awesome.
Good place to have a group events ."
10 Downing Street,Two Hungry Monsters,25 April 2019,4,"It‚Äôs wonderful and lively place on 10th floor.outdoor seating is beautiful. We ordered chicken lasagna, fish & chips, chicken lollipops, veg schezwan noodles, chilli garlic baby corn and schezwan egg fried rice. Every dish was really good but the schezwan egg fried rice could have been better. Mocktails are no doubt the best.must visit place."
10 Downing Street,Vikas Jain,24 April 2019,3,Great ambience and food but cocktails could have been better. I had pasta with white sauce and it was best i had in quite sometime. However i was disappointed with cocktail. I ordered LIIT but it was not as good as i expected.. but overall it was a good visit and i will Probably try something else next time.
10 Downing Street,Irfan Dar,18 April 2019,5,Summer chills are here at Ten D. We get to know that when you try the new Brew Summer Blonde Ale. Highly recommend beer dont miss it cheers beautiful ambience.
10 Downing Street,Arha Krishna Inamdar,13 April 2019,4,"It's in the other side of the SLN Terminus , out door seating is great , ambeince is good , but you feel bored sitting inside !! Food was good !!! Ladies night on Thursday , worth the visit"

Staff behavior 4/5"
10 Downing Street,Soumita Paul,10 April 2019,2,Ambience is good. But quality of food not up to the mark. Good place with family and friends wth music and all. Most pathetic cocktail i ever had
10 Downing Street,David Ebenezer,09 April 2019,4,"10downingstreet is known for it's wonderful ambience. Their In-house Brew is awesome!
One of my all time favourites is the mushroom added 'Shepherd's pie'!
If you want to chill with your gang on a cool sunday evening, the outdoor rooftop bar will be the place!
They also have a cozy dance floor space!"
10 Downing Street,Rajsi Gaikwad,09 April 2019,5,"It's a wonderful and lively place on the 10th floor. We were sitting outside which was even more beautiful. There is even a dance floor near inside sitting area.
The food we ordered was chicken lasagna and veg lasagna, pink pasta and spicy chicken rice of which all were good. The food we ordered was served quickly.
In weekdays the place is lightly crowded which makes it a nice place for dates or for Hangouts."
10 Downing Street,Hungry Soul,06 April 2019,4,"Vegetarian Review ~

This is my go to place when I randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. I don't remember how many times I have been here. On the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though I personally like outdoors. The dance floor is a little small but hey the DJ has to be good right!!

With their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. I like ale above all. We combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
Honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
Dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
Lasagne is good and pasta is so so and I didn't like it that much. Food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. Wines are not that great too so go for beer üòú

The staff is good and friendly. The price is a bit on expensive side I would say. There are minimal cover charges for the pub. The embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.

The DJ is amazing and I always had great time shaking my leg on the floor. So it's a must go if u still haven't been here. üòç"
10 Downing Street,Surya.nandu.SN,03 April 2019,3,I‚Äôm not a huge fan of buffet but I‚Äôve been here only to taste the dishes and they were great and had a variety. This place is for family get togethers. You‚Äôll enjoy the food by its taste and variety and you get food chocked love at the live counters. I‚Äôve been here a long time ago but I still remember my time here. I‚Äôm giving this only three stars only coz I‚Äôm not a fan of buffet.
10 Downing Street,Jaya Prakash,31 March 2019,3,Great ambience and decent brew beer. But there is something very elegant in terms of ambience. But food is on little disappointing. We order chicken starter and French Fry's both where disappointing. In terms of chicken starter I felt high ajino Moto
10 Downing Street,Kiran,30 March 2019,4,The place is decent and not heavily crowded. The ambience and staff courteousness is good. But the food has a bit of room for improvement in terms of taste. The mocktails and onion rings were good. However the dumplings are very poor in taste that we had to send them back.
10 Downing Street,Arun Kalyan,24 March 2019,4,"Had been there for friend's birthday party,it was on Saturday,such an amazing place we have ordered mocktails,veg and non veg starters some alcohol,tasty food fine ambeince but very far from my place,dance floor was so good,go with your frnds and have fun."
10 Downing Street,Avinash Kavde,17 March 2019,5,"Highly recommended place for all the party lovers. I have been to few roof top lounge bars but this is the best. 10th Floor , city view, cool breeze and a drink....what else can one ask for . 5*ratings for the food and the prompt service."
10 Downing Street,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,3,"Food is average, service is poor. Can get crowded. The ambience, especially interior and its seating could have been better. Though finger food is good, not much options for main course"
10 Downing Street,Harshet Agarwal,12 March 2019,4,"Been here through the years
It‚Äôs been so homely and great
I would be happy to come every week if possible
The prices are decent
Food is great
Alcohol is great
Music is not my kind though
Great going team"
10 Downing Street,Joyofcalcutta,12 March 2019,1,"Definitely one of the worst places to go for food.....If you order pasta oligo e olio, you get veggie noodles (yes, not even spaghetti) and the server tries to convince you that's it's what the dish is meant to be.....And you order chicken steak...You get a stale lump of so something covered in a sauce that's possibly cooked and stored for days...... Dangerous to go there."
10 Downing Street,Bhavika Pandya,11 March 2019,5,"It is a very happening pub in the town. TDS , we call it. It is so true that the environment will not let you be lazy or be out of sync. Service is so prompt also the staff is well trained. The DJ is just 10/10. Ambiance is super cool. Must visit place for the all party lovers. also this is value for money."
10 Downing Street,Benedict Paul,10 March 2019,5,"This place has treated me with great warmth every time I have stepped in. As soon as you enter the pleasant attitude of the staff is something that overwhelms me. The doorman, Mr. Gaikwad, Pinkky has always been there to answer all questions. All the waiters have been cordial and pleasant with me, to mention a few names... Venkat, Pradeep, Pradhan, Mahesh and all the others whose names I do not remember. Special thanks to John Blessie for his warm hugs and welcoming smile makes every visit memorable. Sudhakar you 're great a man of sheer intelligence and ideas.

5 stars for such a great experience + 1 more star for all the happy moments you all have shared with me.

Keep up the good work & keep those smiles on our faces... kudos to the staff."
10 Downing Street,Poojitha Reddy,09 March 2019,4,"Absolutely loved the place! It's has a nice classic touch compared to the 10D in Begumpet which has become too crowded and lost it's charm.
You would change your opinion about 10D if you visit this place in Gachibowli.
Rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.
Tip : Do try their in-house beers, there are 4 varieties of them. You can get a sample tray of all flavours, so that you can taste each type and choose whichever you like."
10 Downing Street,Chirag Gupta ?,06 March 2019,4,"This place is lively!
The ambience is good.
There's open terrace too.
The staff is real friendly.
The food is good.
The DJ didn't feel up to the mark though."
10 Downing Street,Vivek,05 March 2019,4,"I had pub lunch at this place yesterday with my family. We ordered beer, one moctkail and one cocktail for drinks and corn and spinach Lasagne, Non veg Lasagne and Fish and Chips. Food was ok, ambience and service was upto the mark as always."
10 Downing Street,Priya Rao,04 March 2019,4,"It is that kind of place which wouldn't cost you an arm and a leg when you eat to your hearts (and ofcourse stomach's too :P) content.
Food is exceptionally amazing. To all the non-veg lovers,chicken lasagna is bae.
The rooftop ambience is amazing- especially in the evenings. The indoor seating is decent :)
4/5 because the staff aren't courteous and they dont respond quickly and we had to call them multiple times to just take the order."
10 Downing Street,Sree,02 March 2019,4,"VEGETARIAN REVIEW: Heard a lot about this place and it did not disappoint me. The only thing that bothered me was the loud music ( I am not talking about the dance floor ), it was so loud that we had to scream to be audible. The dance floor was also decent. Food was amazing, I did not expect such good food at this place.
NOTE: I heard that they are charging Rs. 80 per mineral water bottle.
Must try: Butter Paneer Masala with Naan
Ambience: 3.5/5
Value for money: 4/5
Service: 3/5"
10 Downing Street,Mohit Anand,02 March 2019,3,"To spend a nice evening after Office hours, we visited this place and occupied a table in the open area of it.

The weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.

In drinks, we had Hot toddy, Brewed beer, Fruit punch, Pinnacolada and many other mocktails. All of these were good but there was nothing special about them.

In food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom Tikka, fish and chicken wings.

Loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.

Overall, the place is nice but the food and drinks were okayish in comparison to the other places in town."
10 Downing Street,Krishna Sai,27 February 2019,4,"Entering in to it from parking is something like finding a treasure hunt ;)
besides nice place to hangout, ambiance is great and view from it is nice"
10 Downing Street,Mayur Gangwal,20 February 2019,5,"This place is in the SLN terminus mall...good location with young IT crowd of hitec city pouring in...nice varieties of Beer...huge place, nice setting and ambience...only the dance floor seems congested since it is small...overall a nice place with delicious food"
10 Downing Street,Ishpreet Kaur,15 February 2019,2,"I had gone for lunch a few days back and no doubt the place and food is amazing but I was not given the dessert which was included in the platter and the staff is always looking at you while you're eating, until you finish.
2 stars for food and ambience respectively but for the service they provide, I'm not at all happy with the place."
10 Downing Street,Riha Dhawan,10 February 2019,4,"A great place for beer lovers. Their brews are just amazing specially the herb and citrus one, it's a perfect place for a Saturday Night Fun with the Tandoori starters and the finger foods being just awesome. Worth it"
10 Downing Street,Prashanth K,07 February 2019,4,Well another Brew In town. 2nd 10 D in the town . The one at Begumpet the oldest and class. Apart from the Old rest of the Class remains same. Being a Brewery s an additional advantage with this place. I loved all of them. They have outdoor seating which will amazing in the evenings but you guys need prior reservation for sure .
10 Downing Street,Aanchal Khemka,03 February 2019,4,"We went here for lunch on a girls day out and were amazed with the classy ambiance and decor.

First thing that made us happy was the interiors and the way the place was done.

We tried veg platter for starters which was delicious. The quantities was just right for two people.

We enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns.

The place is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance.

We certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience. At the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on.

Highly recommended!"
10 Downing Street,Sidharth Singal,02 February 2019,4,"Great, lively place to hang out with friends. Music here is great, dj surely knows his music. Service is top notch too. Food wise, starters were yummy. Has paneer kadhai and roti, found it to be spicy but tasty. The outdoor space offers great views of the city. Overall a o brainer when it comes to having good times with friends."
10 Downing Street,Debabrati Sonia,02 February 2019,3,"One place i can visit over and over, just for ambiance.
Lasagne is a must try here..
One thing to keep in mind, they will take the last order 5 mins before it closes, and wont give time to eat will just close the lights and ask u to leave."
10 Downing Street,Kopal TRIVEDI,01 February 2019,3,Went with Collegues for lunch...Good Food.. ..but not so great ambience... Staff is not pleasing at all. There were only bothered about taking plates off the table.
10 Downing Street,Anupam Agarwal,31 January 2019,4,"Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.

Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend

Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try

Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

Overall 3.5
Ambiance 4
Food 3.5
Drinks 4
Service 4
Value for Money 3.5"
10 Downing Street,Roshan Jha,29 January 2019,4,"If you are in hyderabad and its weekend, this place is a must visit place. Awesome crowd, ambience is good overall a perfect weekend hangout place whether you hangout with friends or as a couple.
A must go place."
10 Downing Street,Eben Paul,28 January 2019,5,"10D is my second home. This places ozzes warmth and affection by the management and the staff. A well kept place with great ambience catering to different age groups. They have some gigs organized periodically. The Brew beer here is awesome - Best in town. Kudos to Sanjeev & Palavi.
I would like to highlight some of the friendly and helpful staff in-house. Johnnie Blessie... We all call him John/Johnny he is your go to man for any thing and every thing here at 10D.
Pradeep Pappu- The most generous and helpful guy on the list of staff.
Keep up the good work."
10 Downing Street,Swetcha Karra,27 January 2019,5,"This place is amazing. Ambience, food and music are soooo good. Fish fingers starter is very tasty and even the tandoori platter is good. Only complaint is music is too loud. Other than that no complaints."
10 Downing Street,Pooja Hakke,24 January 2019,5,"From the delicious food and amazing music to the rightly sized drinks, to the brewery it has to offer and not to forget the majestic view from the outdoor seating. It definitely is one of the best pubs of the twin cities which caters to all the needs of the customer!
#publunchisamust
#fridaynightsarebest"
10 Downing Street,Deep,18 January 2019,4,"Good place to hang out with family and friends. I tried couple of Cocktails and Shots. Cocktails were not strong at all. So it was more of plain juice. I would recommend that in the Cocktails menu the should also mention in details what's the base and also the content of alcohol.

Starters were great.. I ordered Chinese platter and I was really nice.
Music was loud and lively."
10 Downing Street,Nupur Saxena,17 January 2019,5,This was an amazing place . You can go there with friends and partner . Awesome ambience and also provides indoor and outdoor sitting area. The food was delicious. We ordered garden fresh pizza and cheese kurkure fingers . Both were amazing . A must go place
10 Downing Street,Aditya Chopra,15 January 2019,1,"My friend and I visited this place on the 13th Of january around 1920 hrs and ordered your strong ALE, we believe that the beer was coughed into and we both fell severly sick with a scratchy throat and dry cough. I dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because I do not think I will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick. I will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick, I can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong Ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and I am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of Jan I never fell sick with the strong Ale it was on the 13th that my friend and I fell sick . Second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? Your staff would stand on my head to make sure I am not smoking pot and are you serious?? I use fresh tobacco like American Spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot, I feel humilated. Train your staff on hygiene and educate them.


PS: My First visit was on the 8th Jan and just FYI across the globe beer sampling is not chargable hence they are called samples."
10 Downing Street,Calming Storm,13 January 2019,4,We had an evening office party here and that too on a Friday. The atmosphere was lively and the terrace view was sublime. The food tasted good though people won't visit the place for the same. A bit heavy on the pricing side but it was worth it.
10 Downing Street,Ganesh Ravi,13 January 2019,5,"Went there on a Friday, we were only stags but we went there early, at about 6pm. The environment was very energetic, we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor. The DJ was amazing, a good mix of English and Hindi songs. Had one of my best night outs here! It was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs."
10 Downing Street,Eating Is Fun,13 January 2019,4,"Vibrant ambience with a loud music, enjoy the dancefloor, beer is good, service is very attentive, food could be better. Bollywood night was happening....."
10 Downing Street,Jagannadh Chowdary,08 January 2019,4,Superb place. cool place to hangout.. having both terrace seating and indoor seating separate room for Dance floor makes this place unique .. great ambience .. brewed beer was also good.. decent and limited crowd. table booking is highly recommended.
10 Downing Street,Ashutosh Tiwari,05 January 2019,4,10D is one of the best places to hangout witj friends and families. Great ambience with awesome views. Food and staff behaviour is very kind.
10 Downing Street,Pavan Kumar,05 January 2019,5,"An amazing place for partying and that much needed respite after a tiring day of work.
10Downing is the brand well known across the breadth and width of the country offers exciting pub lunches and some awesome parties.
This 10D is unique in it's own ways and has a brewery unit attached to it so it is a bonus in terms of the variety on offer for the alcoholics.
Have been to this place on a few occasions once to taste the brews and another visit was for a pub lunch which comes with a glass of draught beer.
My suggestions: Chicken lasagne, Shepard's pie,Roast lamb and a lot more
Must admit the pub lunch here is one of the best and the brews are brilliant to pair with some food.
Overall it is a gem of a place with amazing views,great food choices and a decent collection of drinks to offer you a complete package."
10 Downing Street,Yash Barmecha,03 January 2019,4,"It is a good place but the one in Begumpet is a even better. The food is good. The music calms you on a bad day . If you have the option to the the Begumpet one,then go for it."
10 Downing Street,Sneha Battula,03 January 2019,5,"Ask me about good food, and I'll tell you about 10D. Known for it's best taste and quality food. I've been a regular customer here ever since I moved to Hyderabad and so will I be.

If you've never been here, GO RIGHT AWAY!

MUST HAVE: LASAGNE (10D serves one of the best lasagne ever), Jeera Rice and Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Nachos and Spaghetti Bolognese.

Cons: Wine options are bad, that's the only thing I actually regret. But, If you love beer, you'll get lucky."
10 Downing Street,Saswati Kar Choudhury,03 January 2019,4,We happened to visit this place with office frenz and trust me the rooftop was awesome..the staff was courteous and everything was well managed..we had loads of fun and the food was tasty! I keep visiting this place and always will!
10 Downing Street,Vedant Killa,29 December 2018,3,"A very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset. üôà

I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations.
The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that! It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live!
Coming to food and service, I would rate it 1/5. We tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. We had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark. The service was literally horrible, being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess ü§£ü§™

I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place."
10 Downing Street,Vandana Rastogi,28 December 2018,4,"While the food is pretty similar and standard to their Begumpet outlet, the ambience is worthy of a mention here.
The service is definitely better.

Do up your game with some of the dishes though."
10 Downing Street,Abhisek Mishra,26 December 2018,5,"The ambience along with the roof top view was amazing. The brewery was nice and was like the other breweries in town. The thin crust pizza could have been better. Overall, a nice place to chill out with friends."
10 Downing Street,Shantanu Sharma,26 December 2018,3,"A grand entry, decent ambience and average food. That just about sums it up for 10 Downing Street.
Just as the name suggests, the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes. It's cost, warm and has great layout. But the layout proves to be a negative as well. We went here for lunch and the place was very loud. The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view. The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive. I hope they write down what was ordered.
The food itself was good. We had chicken wings, chicken Tikka, seekh kabab, tandoori veg platter and drinks. The food was good and arrived a tad slow. Overall, it is a good place to have a drink and be merry."
10 Downing Street,Abhishek Singh,21 December 2018,4,"Great place and a really amazing crowd. The ambiance, service, and food are altogether great.
There is a variety in terms of permutations of drinks that this place has to offer.
A must visit place for a fun-filled weekend."
10 Downing Street,Deepanshu Mittal,14 December 2018,1,Very rude staff. Ask them for corporate discount and they will ask you to cancel your reservation. Such a pathetic thing to say to any customer!
10 Downing Street,Randy Orton,10 December 2018,4,A beautiful place with lots of options available at our bay. We went in happy hours and the food was really great with good service and drinks also were apt to go with the food. Overall a great place to hang out.
10 Downing Street,Vishal Ghorpade,09 December 2018,2,"Meh!!! Straight up. Heard from a friend that this is apparently rated the best pub in Hyderabad, but living in bangalore for 25 years and Boston for 5, this place is way over priced to start! Food is good don't get me wrong, but this place is clearly taking your money for the service and ambience which is so genuinely ""Meh""! For example asked for a bottle of water which apparently takes about 20 mins"
10 Downing Street,Luck@chance,04 December 2018,5,"Best Sunday evening of Gachibowli Hydrabad, Dj rocks awoesom Bollywood mashups live music was also very very good, I came with my coulege for celebration, after our Project launch party. Was full tired but good quality sound selection of songs, mature and professional staff change our constraints, restart our engine üòéüòéü§óü§ó.

Service was very quick
Food.. fish tikka
Chicken tikka
Meat ball
Dal tadka
Mutton biryani with raita

Star was 1. FRESH BELGIUM fresh BEER.üòÄ
2. Service and staff
3. Apricot Pudding..

Cheers keep it..

Suggestion.. Please ask to customer ki dal tadka mei kadi patta dalne ko. If requir then only add ... Thanks"
10 Downing Street,Shaily Naik,02 December 2018,2,The only positive thing of the place was the ambience and atmosphere! We ordered nachos which was not served with salsa sauce . The mocktails were good enough but the barbequed paneer tikka was just horrible. It tasted like it was stale and was loaded with a lot of spice !
10 Downing Street,Pratipurna Panda,29 November 2018,3,"Ooo the 10D...
Again, brewed beers... Lovely. Food... Good. Music...can be better.
Very nice ambience. Rooftop setup is oh so lovely..

A bit heavy on pockets. Service is good until the clock ticks 11. I felt, the staff were a bit too in a hurry to get everything closed down and to get lights off which is a turn off. So, folks , get your beers by 10:55 üòÇ"
10 Downing Street,Prakriti Priya,29 November 2018,5,"A good place to relieve all your tension after your work. Good food, good ambience and good crowd. Can't resist myself to be there again...."
10 Downing Street,Rams Mayuri,28 November 2018,4,Hi guys i visited 10 downing last night after long rescrech about the bar and food so my experience on the roof top bar along with cool breezes septamas food ambiguity and cocktails we ordered long llt & üç∫ üç∫ üç∫ taste was good
10 Downing Street,Amit Mathur,25 November 2018,5,"we had a pub lunch at 10d street gachibowli
We had great time .We were grp of 20 members. A perfect sitting arrangement for all 20 members was done by Miss pinky.
We all had good time with good food and ambience."
10 Downing Street,Roma Vanjani,23 November 2018,4,We have visited this place multiple times for lunch. It had now become our go to restaurant for casual team lunches.. The pub lunch menu has quite a few options to choose from and all the items are pretty good. You also get a glass of her or wine or a mojito to choose from. The moon drinkers also have an option to go for a soup or chose a cold drink with the food.. The best part is the food and the service has been consistently good!!!!
10 Downing Street,Kamal Singh Thakur,18 November 2018,5,"Compared to Headquarters in somajiguda this place is 1000 times better equal respect to each and every individual not like headquarters giving respect to rich and wealthy people.

Ambience is super and just a note they should focus on their food quality and quantity

Overall this place is superb"
10 Downing Street,Kalyan Madduru,17 November 2018,3,"This outlet located on 10th floor of SLN terminus, is our team dinner venue.rlRestaurant had a decent ambience, but open top can have some more mild lighting. Brewery is available. But as we booked a buffet in bulk , we got limited options for food and alcohol

Food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers.
Main course was very limited. Biryani's and gravy each one for veg and non veg. Tandoori rotis and nans. Desserts were very limited. Vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun.

Alcohol has 4 options. Bacardi white rum, antiquity whisky, Smirnoff vodka and kf beer.
Mocktails, cool drinks,soda and fruit juice available for Mixing. Loud music with Divine drinks on breezy Roof top is definitely worth a try."
10 Downing Street,Lexu,11 November 2018,4,"This is my go to place for comfort lunches within a budget. You‚Äôll simply have to love their cracking rice and chicken lasagne cause they are to die for.
I love how they always give a drink with this set menu.
The red shredded chicken and crackling rice along with their lasagne were a perfect match for each other.
I‚Äôve also had the chicken nachos which were alright but their lunch menu is a must try."
10 Downing Street,Punit Naik,10 November 2018,5,Great cool place. Had visited it when I was in Hyderabad with my mate. This place has great food and even better brewed beer! A must try if you are in the area.
10 Downing Street,Vineet Bedi,10 November 2018,4,"Ambience - 4.5
Service - 4
Food Taste - 4
Food Portion - 3.5
Price - 3.5

Been here several times. The open terrace is really amazing and the USP for 10D in Gachibowli. Must visit place from Friday to Saturday to enjoy great music plus drinks with your friends!

Cheers!"
10 Downing Street,Vaishali,08 November 2018,5,"One of the best restaurants I have visited in Hyderabad... I like to spend time here whenever I feel like going. The ambience is just awesome. Food is also good but little costly. Drinks are no doubt the best, specially sangria is awesome..."
10 Downing Street,T V Satyanarayana,02 November 2018,4,"Around 11 of us went to this place to have lunch, located a great place in gachibowli.
The ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality.
Coming to food, ordered two non veg platters, all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the cost,its little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality. Beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.
The main course was spread across continental, Chinese and indian. From continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. Again the quantity was less but quality was great. From chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.In indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. All these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.

The main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch. Best enjoyed when visited with max 3-4 ppl.

Food:4.5/5
Ambience:4/5
Hospitality:4/5
Value for money:3.5/5"
10 Downing Street,Aditya,01 November 2018,4,Food is just average but the ambiance and the quality of service is amazing. I love their Chicken Lasagna and Stroganoff. Chicken Nachos and 10D Special Chicken Pizza are the dishes I almost always order. Their beers are good.
10 Downing Street,Rishabh Wahi,01 November 2018,4,"Ambience is absolutely fantastic, it feels like a much more expensive place than it is. Their pub lunch menu is a great idea what you get is more than worth the money you pay. I had bolognese spaghetti with red wine, it wasn't the best one I've had but still tasted great."
10 Downing Street,Kaumudi Moholkar,31 October 2018,2,"I have always loved the TDS chain. Been to Kolkata, Bhopal and Hyderabad. But hyderabad has been the worst experience ever.Very bad service. We had to wait for long hours for the food to be served. No one was bothered even about the bill."
10 Downing Street,Sushil Kumar Gupta,29 October 2018,4,Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun.
10 Downing Street,Deepak Banka,26 October 2018,3,"Didn't like the ambience. Also what's the point of giving drinks in plastic cups to girls, do you want to make them feel bad that they are getting free drinks. Overall not a very good experience."
10 Downing Street,Nomula Sai Kiran,25 October 2018,1,"I dont know what kind of pub is this.. U people dont allow stag on weekends and u people allow on weekdays... Bill tho stag hi pay kartha reey bhai.. Yehi city meey highlife, lal steet, repete, clubN, playboy, prost, koi bhi tum logoke jaisa behave nahi Kartheey better come out from that illusion"
10 Downing Street,Tanjiba Afrin,24 October 2018,4,"Well I have lost count how many times I have visited this place.Not only this one the Punjagutta branch as well and the place has never disappointed me.Went with few of my friends after office,the ambiance,music and food is too lovely and bang on-always.Crowd too is good.Simply love this place."
10 Downing Street,Abhimanyu,23 October 2018,5,"I have been to quite a few similar places in Hyderabad and after a lot of hype about this place, finally on the Monday night we visited this place for a team dinner and needless to say that it was a really enthralling experience.
Starting from the reception area *( especially that guy with a moustache... You made the night with your behavior).
After entering the lounge, it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations.
The service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts.
But at the end of the night it was the DJ guy who outperformed everyone. You will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again. Being from North India, finally got the chance to dance to those Punjabi songs listening to which I have grown. Danced with the heart in my palm. Needless to say that the DJ guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections.
In short, a happening place and if it's your day then these small things will just make your night."
10 Downing Street,Unnatirocks95,21 October 2018,4,Great food!! Amazing interior with a decent dance floor. Lovely ambience . Good for a weekend chill out. Lovely staff and service. Drinks are good.
10 Downing Street,Anirudh Verma,19 October 2018,5,"In love with Calcutta 10 downing Street and found the same in hyderabad, craving to be there to have Chinese flavorism. Located in busy streets of Hyderabad, at a very fine executive apartments of Marriott at 10th floor.
Tried Shanghai rice with schezwan sauce.
A must try for Chinese flavorism"
10 Downing Street,Azarudeen Akthar Batcha,18 October 2018,4,A nice noisy eventful Saturday night happens here. Well typically if you are stags very difficult to get entry on Saturdays and by luck you are in you have to dance outside of the dance floor. Food was above average. If you're a party guy go on weekends.
Pakwaan Grand,Tyrion Lannister,18 May 2019,3,"Date of Visit: 17/05/2019

Pakwaan Grand,Kunal Khanra,18 May 2019,4,"It's right one the main road, pretty big haleem joint in hyderabad. What we felt that the service was a bit slow and they were confused which haleem we actually ordered. Coming to the main reason.. It didn't dissapoint us.. Mutton Haleem was amazing.. Enriched with Pure ghee and dry fruits."
Pakwaan Grand,Pratap,17 May 2019,3,"Ordered Special Mashad Haleem,it tasted good and was topped with Kaju, Almonds, Pistachios and fried onions. It's a must try over here.
Special Mashad Haleem: 4/5

Had also tried veg manchuria, chicken biryani, double ka meetha, murg malai kabab.
Chicken biryani was average. Not a big fan of this.
Veg manchuria was ok.
Murg malai kabab was good, should definitely try this one
Double ka meetha was ok"
Pakwaan Grand,Raana Prathap,06 May 2019,3,"Average food for cheap cost,better we can go for only for grilled chicken and tandoori not so for Biryani and the quantity was too good for less cost"
Pakwaan Grand,Lovely Priyanka,01 May 2019,1,"Service is too bad and ambience is not bad.food is not taste....waste for atleast 1visit
We hav ordered chicken and prawns and veg items..
Chicken is better out that 2/5 byt remaining are worst"
Pakwaan Grand,Towheed Moneeb,23 April 2019,2,Food was good and the service was too slow we wait for 25 minutes but no one come on out table for the order oftet when we talk with manager he was also with full of attitude. Over all rating 2*
Pakwaan Grand,Komala Krn,21 April 2019,4,"I won't say not to try non veg in this restaurant it was good but palak dishes are awesome.
Must try palak paneer and paneer kaju biryani ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Pakwaan Grand,Moumita Das,08 April 2019,4,"They are good! But they are like those moody people, sometimes bad! I had both the experiences. I liked their biryanis mostly! Try their mutton biryani. I mostly use them for home delivery. They are good and pocket friendly!"
Pakwaan Grand,Rahul Kumar,22 March 2019,4,Love the Biryani here! Have visited this place multiple times & it never disappoints. Place is a little crowdy as it is located beside the SEZ.
Pakwaan Grand,Ramakanta Mohanty,18 March 2019,4,"I am a vegetarian but I went to Pakwaan Grand with my family(Non-veg) as per reference of my colleague.

Ordered few Kababs, Biriyani, Nan, Panner 
Value for money.
Quantity is good.
Taste : We specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
Service : That time I think only 4-5 table filled. But they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. No rice to parent). He just did what he thought. Then I started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. In one word it's un-professionalism.
Service time : Good, timely delivered the ordered items. 

Recommended for Family Lunch/Dinner."
Pakwaan Grand,Bheemu Arjunsaikrishnareddy,09 March 2019,2,Below average food and quantity is also below average . they overlly used some spices . i ordered some Qubani sweet is also below average . nothing used other than one fruit and sugar.
Pakwaan Grand,Mukesh Verma,02 March 2019,5,delivered on time
Pakwaan Grand,Vamshi Reddy,02 March 2019,5,The best restaurant to taste grill chicken and combination of butter nan and chicken butter masala goes crazy.everyone must try these combinations .
Pakwaan Grand,Samrat Ghosh,28 February 2019,1,Ordered Chicken manchuria dry and biriyani... chicken was completely dry... it was not at all moist and manchurian taste was not at all induced into it... ordered full sent me half.... biriyani was like a spicy pulao... plz understand the difference between biriyani and pulao
Pakwaan Grand,Rayudu,27 February 2019,3,Biryani taste is awesome and delivery also on time but sometimes when I order I get worst Biryani..it looks like I got someone's leftover Biryani...
Pakwaan Grand,"Moha,ed Jalaludeen",24 February 2019,1,"Worst thing I got 4 dinner, I ordered Full grill it was not all grilled unable to eat also Full like a flesh the worst grill in my life I hate"
Pakwaan Grand,Dipjyoti Deka,23 February 2019,4,Good restaurant which is not overhyped but serves food to my taste. Not too spicy just the right balance of spices and aromas. Ordered Chicken Masala and Roti which was again good and ordered Plate Biryani all of this was sufficient for 2 people and we truly enjoyed it.
Pakwaan Grand,Sindhurani29,23 February 2019,1,Worst biryani they mix normal rice in biryani more than basmati. Ordered fish biryani and it tasted pathetic. It was the first time I ordered and IL make sure not to order or visit such a disgusting place ever again.
Pakwaan Grand,Vinod,22 February 2019,1,Response from hotel is ‚Äúkhaana hi to kha nai to ja‚Äù AC doest work in summer and even server behaves as if hez the owner of hotel. Doesn‚Äôt recommend for dine in here.
Pakwaan Grand,Maheshmanikantan24,21 February 2019,5,very good
Pakwaan Grand,Sahiti Vemulapalli,21 February 2019,5,I became a big fan for their Chicken Biryani. I ordered thrice but there is no difference in the food taste and always tasted wonderful. üòÑüòÑ
Pakwaan Grand,Tulasi Ram,19 February 2019,3,Biriyani taste is good but got 75 percentage of full spicy biriyani that too it was like one rice part is attached with another rice part with help of masala.... So please mention special request clearly in the comment session while ordering(example:need little spicy biriyani)..

Pakwaan Grand,Pendam Vinod,09 February 2019,1,They given normal chicken meat by marinating that I was ordered grilled chicken .worst grilled I ever tested .please ever try at this resturent
Pakwaan Grand,ImmanueL M (MooD),07 February 2019,5,"Somewhere i feel like this n shah competes with each other, one triesto deliver the best carrying both quality and quantity. Seems like they ain't running for money but to feed us hahahaha...!!"
Pakwaan Grand,Avinash,04 February 2019,4,"I and my colleague missed our lunch due to the work load and was craving for something tasty. It was 3 in the noon and we planned to order some curry and started since both of us brought mains from home. Hence, we wanted to try something we haven't had before, and zeroed on Pakwaan Grand.

Checked out the menu and found Chicken Afghani, Pepper chicken to be their favorites. Ordered these, though ZOMATO, however, ZOMATO RUINED IT with delivery part the food was worth the wait.

The Chicken Afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. The pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species.

The gravy was unique because i had Chicken Afghani in other restaurants but Pakwaan has their own way of presenting it.

Overall it was a wholesome meal for 2 of us.

4/5 food

Packaging 3/5

Value of money 3.5/5"
Pakwaan Grand,T V Satyanarayana,02 February 2019,1,"Never ever order grill chicken and rumali roti from this place.Served a half cooked chicken and damn cold and old rumali roti. The chicken was pathetic, I hope i dont get food poisoning. Too bad. Even the onion were damn stale."

Pakwaan Grand,Aditya Choudhary,10 January 2019,1,"Ordered from Zomato, very bad Rotis, were made of Maida, half baked. Rotis were having an unpleasant smell (don't know what was that). Had to dispose off and order from different resturant. Very bad experience"
Pakwaan Grand,Rahul Thati,10 January 2019,3,"I had ordered grilled chicken from pakwaan grand, firstly it wasn't grilled but it was cooked. It was juciy and tender but it was not grilled. The spicness was mild and light. I had tasted their Biryani which was little strong on spiciness but grilled chicken was nothing compared to it."
Pakwaan Grand,Marsha,10 January 2019,3,Dal makhani and kadhai mushroom both were okayish.Mushroom pieces could have been more.Packaging was nice.Delivery was a lot late though.Overall moderate experience:)
Pakwaan Grand,üçõüç≤ü•ó,07 January 2019,3,"I have been to this place earlier. Didn't like the ambience.
This time i ordered mini chicken Biryani from food panda for 66 rs. It is totally worth the money spent.
Taste was good. Chicken would have been bit tender.

It was lot better than its famous neighbour

Taste - good

Pakwaan Grand,Maroof Ali,30 December 2018,1,This place is worst.. biryani worst than ever... no quality of rice and not at all good ingredients.. worst biryani ever I eated. Worst worst worst.
Pakwaan Grand,Jaya Gubrele,30 December 2018,1,Worst Biryani I have ever tasted..... Experience was not at all good.. Staff is also not so cooperative.. Ambience is also not that good.. Okayish..
Pakwaan Grand,Nitesh Singh,05 December 2018,1,"Wost Biryani I ever had from here today. I know, it was late when I ordered for 'Paneer Biryani' but the delivery I received was absolutely unexpectable.
It was a plain rice with Butter Paneer Masala at the end, seriously I was shocked when I opened the package.
Last time, I ordered 'Veg Biryani' which was also just accpetable.
So, from my past experience food from this place is totally non-recommendable, specially for vegiterians.
Pakwaan Grand team, guys plzzz"
Pakwaan Grand,TARUN KUMAR,03 December 2018,1,Worst experience. Grilled chicken was spoiled. First I thought it was not cooked well but I realized that foul smell is coming and the chicken is not at all fresh.
Pakwaan Grand,KOTI REDDY Tatiparthy,01 December 2018,1,"Ordered Mushroom Curry from Pakwaan Grand via zomato. The worst chicken non veg curry , with no chicken ke naam par ek bons How can anyone serve piece First & last time, no more ordering."
Pakwaan Grand,Leher Sadhnani,01 December 2018,5,"‚ÄùYummy Pakwaan‚Äù

It was around 11 pm that i started craving for mutton biryani. So i went ahead and ordered a Mini Mutton Biryani pack and to my surprise this mini pack tasted sooo good that doing little by little i ate more than i actually wanted too. A must try biryani which came with 4-5 medium sized mutton, nice masala and really good quantity. This can surely be served for 2 people. Have also tried their mini chicken biryani which comes with one big chicken leg piece. Compartively less spicey than mutton one. When you get tasty food at just Rs 110. Why do you deny it?"
Pakwaan Grand,Ramineni Haritha,29 November 2018,1,I ordered special mutton biryani in pakwan. The biryani is oily and full spicy. I hope the biryani is afternoons one. Pieces are not boiled and very bad experience with pakwan grand. Please appoint a good chef üò†üò†üò†

Pakwaan Grand,Venkat Reddy,05 October 2018,1,"In name of offer on Uber Eats, this restaurant is cheating with customers, using third class quality rice for biryani and no meat at all in mutton biryani, not even single piece, atleast rice should be good, that also full masala and full oily. Will complain to food inspection officials of GHMC, customers will get diseases by eating such kind of full masala biryani and low quality rice"
Pakwaan Grand,Seshadri Reddy,05 October 2018,3,This place lacks consistency. Everytime I go there I have different experience. Sometimes I had amazing Biryani with prompt service and sometimes a disappointing one. The biryani was consistent majority of times. One of my go to place for biryani
Pakwaan Grand,Saanthwana Tirunagari,04 October 2018,1,"I accept that the biryani was soon good. but the raita was stale and sour. As such reputed restaurant, they should look after quality"

Pakwaan Grand,Teja Dandigunta,26 September 2018,4,"Been here only for tea and snacks, the guy over there suggested to try irani chai, insisted us again and again, so we finally went for it along with osmania biscuits, cream buns and dil pasand, Irani chai was amazing and osmania biscuits are perfect combination with them.

Pakwaan Grand,Hemachandra,25 September 2018,4,This is kinda good for biryani and is exactly located beside the shah ghouse . I heard about this place before many times so I wanted to try it so I went . This place has both ac and non AC section . Coming to biryani it was finely cooked but the tandoori chicken was burnt more that it needed . Finally good place to visit easily located and comes to food . It was worth the hype
Pakwaan Grand,Deva,25 September 2018,5,good sarvic
13 Dhaba,Sarika,25 May 2019,4,"I didn't go and eat at the Dhaba.
I had ordered from here. The taste was amazing and te only issue was packaging of the order.
A must have is Alu Parantha and lassi."
13 Dhaba,Ankur,25 May 2019,5,"Nothing much to say but got authentic north indian food taste in south India. Chole bhature were mouth watering. Lassi was thick & fresh.
The ambience gives a glimpse of an North Indian roadside dhaba."
13 Dhaba,Kumar Ajay,19 May 2019,5,"Eating there or getting delivered amazing food. Have had their chole bhature panner paratha. Kadi chawal, aloo kulcha and panner tikka bilkul ghar ka taste"
13 Dhaba,Henna Mittal,18 May 2019,1,I ordered Rajma which turned out to be salty spiced water without any Rajma in it. Avoid the place because quality doesn‚Äôt seem to be given much importance.
13 Dhaba,Yogesh Kumar Gupta,09 May 2019,5,"Ordered Meals(Dal makhni + Rice + roti + Aloo Gobhi). Tastes really good and was fulfilling too. Just one thing, if you could include some plastic cutlery, So that we can pour curries into the bowls. It is difficult to manage this in office without cutlery."
13 Dhaba,M Jayanand,07 May 2019,1,Place is a mess was shocked to see chaos the other day and i had an upset stomach after having the food from here there was total confusion i will never order from this place again n frank opinion it reminded me of hell sorry but i spoke my mind.
13 Dhaba,Rakesh Singh,28 April 2019,1,The paneer paratha is not good as expected. It need to be improved. The paneer stuffed insided paratha is not seem to be fresh instead it look like worst paneer that I had eaten so far.
13 Dhaba,Sekhujaan,23 April 2019,5,Good food
13 Dhaba,Niharika Rayat,22 April 2019,3,"Ordered dal makkhani rice multiple times. Panner paratha is good. Quantity is less for one person. Even the large size is only served as small to medium size.

Packaging is nice although not separate. Food can't be stored, supposed to be eaten as and when ordered as both dal and rice are packed together. 

Food seems hygienic. Need to work on quantity for different size meals as it is not enough."
13 Dhaba,Sonali,15 April 2019,4,Visited to this place yesterday on one of my friend's recommendation. Found it one of the best punjabi dhaba in Hyderabad. The tastes remind me of Punjab. It offers a variety of delicious home made food. Pice is affordable. Loved the cold lassi. A must visit place if you are a food lover.
13 Dhaba,Shalu Singh,14 April 2019,3,I would recommend this place for ordering purpose. The food is good in taste but being you may not find that healthy. Good north indian food.
13 Dhaba,Syed Ishaq,09 April 2019,5,It's awesome tasty food and hygiene food it's feel like U are in Punjabi Dhaba lassi is so much good in taste paneer tikka and tandoori items is good in price and taste family ac section is good and clean
13 Dhaba,Mahender Sokhal,09 April 2019,1,"1 : PATHETIC TASTE OF FOOD, IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.I  Ordered Rajma , Chapati and Rice and Rajma was too much salty aprox 10 times and same with raita too , i am sure if someone will make rajma blind folded still he/she can not make as pathetic as it was.
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."
13 Dhaba,Mallika Sen-Ali,07 April 2019,1,"Outlet was once a treat for the Punjabi dishes, but over the period of time, the quality is going down and the so-called ‚Äògoooooddessst‚Äô taste has been missing the mark more than once.
Yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.
Wish the management will work upon the food quality. Because at this rate, they‚Äôre losing out on loyal customers."
13 Dhaba,Pragya,24 March 2019,5,"On-time delivery..delivery handling was also good. Food is being my favorite now.
I thank to restaurant and zomato as well for better service"
13 Dhaba,Mohammed Asif Ali Khan,20 March 2019,1,Very sad with the order. The youghurt/curd used to make the lassi was utterly sour. Somehow managed to drink and my stomach was upset. Please use fresh Curd.
13 Dhaba,Mitali Agrawal,20 March 2019,3,"A small place nearby gachibowli circle.
Ambience : 2/5
Alloo kulcha tandoori is very good from this place. Though main course is not so good."
13 Dhaba,Aayushi,12 March 2019,4,I ordered paneer paratha & sweet lassi and both were just superb.one star less as salt was not appropriate in the paneer paratha. Overall the food was just nearing perfection. The delivery was also well in time and the delivery personnel was also a well behaved guy.
13 Dhaba,Kanika Gautam,12 March 2019,5,"I have been there multiple times and have ordered food at home as well.... 13 Dhaba has never let me down.. i love aloo parantha.. paneer tikka is mind blowing.. lassi is perfect.. chole bhature is osum... poori sabzi, rajma gobhi ka paranthe.. list is endless.. i have tried out everything there... even i loved aloo ki sabzi and kachori.. but its no longer continued.. the place has been renovated and its nice to be there and have the real taste of punjab.... i make sure m there often... 13 Dhaba rocks and i love their hospitality... these people never deny you for anything (like extra pyaaz, achaar or raita)which makes it more friendly and comfortable.... one can pay for these extra little things but the way they show generosity in serving these asks without a frown for money, make them very very friendly and makes people to go there more.. u ppl rock!!!

In phtos, its tandoori roti, lachcha parantha, aloo gobhi ki sabzi and paneer dish"
13 Dhaba,Kathuria.rohitash,19 February 2019,4,"I ordered Rajma,Aloo parantha & roti . only 1 word .. wow.. home made food .. specially for those folks who come from north to south & miss taste of north dishes..will definitely order again"
13 Dhaba,Nishtha Chandarana,14 February 2019,4,"I have ordered food from this well known paratha place..
I ordered aloo paratha and paneer paratha.. usually their parantha's are tasty and flavorful but this time it was little bland in taste..aloo paratha was still got but paneer paratha was little bland and tastless..

But still wold like to say whenever I visit this palace they served hot yummy food..love their chole bhature too..loved the way they served masala onion..

Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more food fun and pics.."
13 Dhaba,Abhishek Patel,10 February 2019,1,half of the order was not delivered by the restaurant. and they didn't bother to pick the call for that
13 Dhaba,Rishab Singh,10 February 2019,1,"Just ordered Gobhi kulcha and daal makhani.
Kulcha, full raw from both sides and no pickle and onions provided.
Highly disappointed and will not prefer to order again as this is the 4-5th time this happened.
Many times I have been to that place and politely gave my feedback but it seems customer satisfaction is not their priority."
13 Dhaba,Rishi Agrawal,10 February 2019,4,I have been here a while back and it was really work 5 stars for it kind but there has been a loot of cost cutting it seems but it still is great for some breakfast and/or lunch
13 Dhaba,Sunita Mandal,09 February 2019,4,"Awesome kulcha with kaali dal & raita.
Paneer combo & Dal combo was good, however the aloo gobi dry sabzi served with it, was too salty. Don't order these combos. Instead order their yummy parathas & kulchas.
Ambience - 1/5
Food - 4/5
Self service only.
Even though it is over crowded for its size, they don't make you wait like the bigger restaurants."
13 Dhaba,Anukriti Singh,04 February 2019,5,"The best place to enjoy punjabi food.... on weekendz its bit crowdy but on week days it is not.. i believe in hyderabad u cnt get amazing punjabi food. Moreover it is self service. Everyone must try lassi over there

Food 5/5"
13 Dhaba,ANWAR SHAH KHAN,02 February 2019,5,"Best north Indian food in Hyderabad, aloo and panner kulcha is good lassi was good Rajma rice.
Sarso ka saag makki ki roti is good

13 Dhaba,Vijay Singh,02 February 2019,1,"Do you guys understand the meaning of half and full quantity while you deliver food? How it affects the situation during lunch when the food delivered is incomplete and cannot be eaten by two, this 1* is to ruin my personal experience with you guys. As even the zomato CS was pathetic to resolve it"
13 Dhaba,Andy,31 January 2019,4,I ordered butter rotis but got plain rotis and tasted vary dry! üòêüòê
13 Dhaba,Arpit Bhatia,30 January 2019,1,I havent got my order yet!!!
13 Dhaba,Ram Prasad,27 January 2019,1,Very bad packing of the food. It all got mixed with each other. Couldn't have the meal which I ordered. Pls make sure to pack properly when sending it for the delivery.
13 Dhaba,Harika Reddy,19 January 2019,4,"I have been to this restaurant couple of times this small restaurant is situated near the gachibowli flyover
their paneer tikka is the star dish
I have also ordered aloo paratha and paneer kulcha which were too gud"
13 Dhaba,Asha Bishnoi,14 January 2019,5,This place is epitome of punjabi food.If I have a craving for punjabi food I prefer this place over anyother punjabi restaurant.And during lohri time this place is enlightened with joy.They serve sarsoon da saag and makki di roti which is lusciousüòç
13 Dhaba,Jay Mehta,13 January 2019,5,"Eating there or getting delivered amazing amazing food. Have had their chole poori, aloo/gobi/panneer paratha ...-all of which are great! Been there 1 time but ordered 4-5 times!"
13 Dhaba,Himanshu Parekh,13 January 2019,1,did not give paratha as mentioned in menu
13 Dhaba,Shubham Shinde,06 January 2019,4,"This place reminds me of Pune's Khau Galli. The parathas were awesome, with the butter it gave a homelike taste. The priving is reasonable. Its a good place for coming with family, the seating is sufficient for 4 people.
The aloo paratha, gobhi paratha and paneer paratha were delicious and upto the mark. But tandoori aloo paratha and Makke ki roti aur sarso ka saag were some other level. Very nicely cooked and incredible taste.
Worth a visit . Highly recommended"
13 Dhaba,Saketh Ram,05 January 2019,5,"This has been our go-to place for Alu ka Paratha since 2013. The softness of the core and the ghee on top of it make the dish amazing!

Although I don‚Äôt stay here any more, this is one of the places I aim to go to on every visit."
13 Dhaba,Mousumi Choudhary,05 January 2019,5,par expectation..too gud
13 Dhaba,Love Gupta,01 January 2019,4,A place where you go to have good North Indian food in hyderabad. The taste of food they serve is almost similar to what we get in North India. It is self service place and because of crowd the service is slow sometimes. The sardar who is owner of this place is a nice and friendly chap. Good place to satisfy your North Indian food cravings.
13 Dhaba,Arvapally Omkar,20 December 2018,4,"ESPECIALLY NAANS ARE VERY TASTY AND YUMMY!!WHENEVER WE ORDER .,WE WILL GET VERY HOT!!!NAANS WITH CHOLE IS VERY GUD COMBINATION!!PRICES ARE ALSO VERY LESS COMPARED TO OTHER RESTAURANENTS!!!!"
13 Dhaba,P Arora,16 December 2018,5,"Great Food as always. I have ordered multiple times with favs including Rajma Chawal, Kadi Chawal, Masala Raita (Mostly received in bottle) & Aloo kulcha. 
Bilkul Ghar jaisa taste with optimum spices and quantity. Uploading some pics and will upload more"
13 Dhaba,Kota Srinidhireddy,07 December 2018,4,"One of the best dhabas located in the centre of the city,must try for all the punjabi food lovers ,the taste of parathas mouth watering and they have the best lassi .Best one , service is also quick to the amount of crowd they handle.Swaadist bojan kao paett ka pooja karo üòõ"
13 Dhaba,Aman,06 December 2018,4,"That was a nice place.a self servised,take over food stall that serves the real punjabi taste in the nizam city of india i.e. hyderabad.
I suggest u people to go and enjoy the food and you will feel really traditional. üôÇ"
13 Dhaba,Projwal Tiwari,06 December 2018,5,The best place to have authentic Punjabi food in city!! The paneer tikka here is the best I've ever had!! Dal combo is something which I would recommend anyone to take!!
13 Dhaba,Pooja Agarwal,02 December 2018,1,worst. please stop selling chole bhature
13 Dhaba,Divya Sriram,30 November 2018,5,"When anyone asks me about Punjabi food or Paranthes- 13 Dhaba comes to my mind! I remember when everyone was praising it so much and how if you go late, the paranthes get over-I grabbed two of my friends and travelled nearly 30 kms - reached Gachibowli-stood in a long cue--just to have theor paranthas, lassi, moong dal halwa!!! A heavenly and very Desi experience- The owners are very down-to-earth Punjabi folks who really live up to their name and fame!! Do visit if you are craving authentic Punjabi home-cooked meals as well!! Love this place!!"
13 Dhaba,Abhishek Shukla,28 November 2018,2,"very bad packing, quality of rice and gobi curry was bad. Better read delivery reviews before ordering. Zomato should look into the quality of packing before delivering"
13 Dhaba,Mishti S,18 November 2018,1,Ordered Kadhi pakoda rice combo (Nov 2018). It was extremely bad. The rice seemed to be cooked with a lot of baking soda. Kadhi was awful to taste. Avoid this dish.
13 Dhaba,Deepthi,18 November 2018,2,Poori was very oily
13 Dhaba,Shovan M,09 November 2018,5,"We went for our Friday dinner. Ordered the large paneer paratha, which really was very large to finish it off by one person. It had a good stuffing of paneer inside. It was well covered with butter and along with came the ideal raita.

Not only we stopped here, we ordered small aloo paratha, Gobi paratha, which were hot and yummy!
The chole masala was not okay. But the paneer curry was delicious with paratha.

Last but not the least the aloo kulcha was decent along with the rajma masala. We all were extremely satisfied with the food which we had here.

It's a pocket friendly and nearby place. A must visit for all the foodies."
13 Dhaba,Deepti Handa,04 November 2018,5,Amazing Punjabi food at very affordable prices.üëçüëçüëç Specially Kadhi and Rajma. Only the salt was a little more but otherwise yumilicious food.
13 Dhaba,AKASH NEGI,31 October 2018,5,delivery is very fast...
13 Dhaba,Shubham Padiya,27 October 2018,1,"I have ordered big Aloo Paratha with butter, pickle, raita but they have only delivered Paratha without anything. Not sure how they are expecting us to eat only dry Paratha."
13 Dhaba,Gaurav Sharma,19 October 2018,5,"This place servers the best kuchas and parathas in hyderabad.i have been here many times and this is my first review and i absolutely love the food over here.

Must try items here are alu kucha ,chole bahturae ,alu onion paratha and sweet lassi.

This place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here who,this place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad.

Giving 5 start only for food,do no expect any kind of ambiance , visit this place only if you eat punjabi food."
13 Dhaba,VJvarun,18 October 2018,4,"Taste * Quality * Quality * value for money
For these 4 benchmark its an Good place whenever i visited this place never get disappoint.
Must try : dalmakhni, panner kulcha, chole bhature

-bike/car parking is there
-mostly time self service
-Ambience so ok but food taste balance that."
13 Dhaba,Srishti Bhardwaj | Exploring Life Tastes,17 October 2018,4,"The quality of food is commendable, the Indian dishes will completely make you like this place. However this is not a dining like restaurant, it has a very small place, it is an actual dhaba. So definitely don't judge a book by its cover, you get the best tastes in such places."
13 Dhaba,Madhuri,13 October 2018,1,Poori with aloo curry.... Not at all good... Poori is like paratha and full of oil. Texture is very hard and curry with full of masala.... I had my worst breakfast
13 Dhaba,Lakshmi P,13 October 2018,4,"A lovely homelike food experience. Love the tawa parathas and chole bhature from this place. Must try!
The packing is really good and worth the money."
13 Dhaba,Vinay Kumar,12 October 2018,2,Not upto punjabi standards.. Also packaging was not good.
13 Dhaba,Bhushan Srivastava,12 October 2018,5,Food was great
13 Dhaba,Aman Agarwal,11 October 2018,5,For all those who wants to have a proper North Indian meal should check this place. Parathas with Lassi will be a perfect combo for a Sunday lunch. Panner is also great.
13 Dhaba,Ayush Bairagi,09 October 2018,5,Delicious food
13 Dhaba,Sridhar,09 October 2018,4,"Visited yday and must say the service is poor and the ambiance is average but you visit this place for the authentic Punjabi delicacies. Visit with clear focus and set expectations. :-)
===

In the mood for some authentic Punjabi food, headout to 13 Dhaba to taste lipsticking and finger licking food. My personal favorite is the Dal Makhani. The combos are worth a special mention here.

Ambience is not great but that gets compensated for by the affordability of the place. Recommended joint if you are around Gachibowli circle."
13 Dhaba,Srikar,07 October 2018,5,"One of the amazing places in Hyderbad serving good Punjabi food.
Had aloo kulcha with dal makhani , aloo paratha with chole and paneer tikka. All the dishes tasted awesome. Service is also good."
13 Dhaba,Ankit Kumar,05 October 2018,1,received half order......paratha with curry was delivered without curry ........ while paying for combo
13 Dhaba,Nivin Paul Vincent,05 October 2018,5,on time delivery
13 Dhaba,Khadijah Hussain,04 October 2018,5,"Best Punjabi corner in whole Hyderabad, compared to other Punjabi restaurants I have been.
You can see the satisfaction on my face üòåüòâ
From Parathas to kulchas to chole bhature everything is simply delicious.

Must try: Paneer Tikka. Soft, full of spice and cooked with lots of love.

Happy eating!"
13 Dhaba,Mayank,30 September 2018,3,The overall taste is good and I recommend Paneer Thali which is both reasonable and yummy. But if you order paranthas then the North Indian taste that a parantha has is little missing. Overall combos are good and Thali's too are nice option to go for.
13 Dhaba,The Binge Journal,30 September 2018,4,"We had been wanting to visit 13 Dhaba for quite some time, having heard the raving reviews about their North Indian preparations. Finally ended up trying their steaming hot, gobsmacking parathas and they're truly some of the best you can find in Hyderabad üòç

The Aloo Tawa Paratha is actually stuffed with loads of filling as compared to other places that serve doughy parathas. The Paneer kulcha was also smothered in butter and served with onions and curd.
We ordered the small Aloo Paratha but it was ginormous and we were almost full by the time we were done with it ü§≠

They serve other north Indian delicacies like Rajma Chawal, Kadhi Chawal, Dal Makhni and Lassi which are on our To-Try list."
13 Dhaba,Taranddeep Singgh,29 September 2018,3,The food was prepared quickly and was also delivered on time. However the salt in both the dishes ordered was very high hence faced difficulties in eating. Please balance the spices in order to not to spoil the food.
13 Dhaba,Ganesh Jagwan,18 September 2018,4,"Ye dhaba nhi hota to hyd m mera kya hota üòÄ, parathe, kulcha, bhature, aalu gobhi, makhni every thing you get here at good price, I am ordering from here from last 2 and half years.
2 think don't like here one paneer paratha and masala rayta. They don't give option for normal curd."
13 Dhaba,Rahul Thati,17 September 2018,4,"Located near the Gachibowli ORR circle ""13 DHABA"" is easily accessible. They had a wide variety of parathas and north Indian dishes. We had taken gobhi paratha and aloo-kulcha both tasted great. The ambience is not that good as it just a roadside stop. Overall for a quick eatery, this can be bookmarked."
13 Dhaba,Juveria Syed,15 September 2018,5,good...
13 Dhaba,Pathipaka Simba,15 September 2018,5,The true punjabi affair i must say ......we heard about this place from our buddies and man it was so good .....we ordereded all the varities like parathas tikas and the lassi at the last......üíØrecomendedüëçüèª
13 Dhaba,Nishi Kohli,12 September 2018,5,By far the best aalo paranthas I ever had in Hyderabad. Righly cooked with appropriate stuffing. Served with masala raita and daal makhni. I will recommend their Butter naan and daal makhni to everyone who crave for north indian meal. Will definitely order again.
13 Dhaba,Mitesh Patel,09 September 2018,1,"I didnt get what i ordered...i ordered dal makhni combo and i got combo without dal makhni, just got rice ,roti and onion....terrible service"
13 Dhaba,Prachita Jayaswal,07 September 2018,4,"Decent food with good quality. Dal makhani, aaloo gobhi are good. Amongst the bread, stuffed kulcha and lachcha paratha are nice. It's a pocket friendly place and the quantity served is good enough."
13 Dhaba,Niraj Shelar,02 September 2018,3,"didn't like tandoori paneer paratha much, paneer makhani was average."
13 Dhaba,Sainath Reddy,01 September 2018,5,Rangadhar‚Äôs service is amazing! Love to be here always :) Great food and hospitality!! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç Highly recommended! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
13 Dhaba,Kajal Arora,01 September 2018,3,ordered aloo gobhi..average taste. chapatis were soft.
13 Dhaba,Shashi Lal,01 September 2018,1,I agree... They provide food better than ordinary. But i would definitely not recommend people to order from here. They provided incomplete order which is ok... It can happen. But over that they were not responsible too... Their behaviour is very rude which is not professional. It sounded as if it's my fault not theirs.
13 Dhaba,Sonal Sai,27 August 2018,4,"Okay, so I am not a veg person usually, but then, it was Raksha Bandhan yesterday, and I had to abide by the rules. Now, thinking of Punjabi Restaurants or Dhabas, we usually picturize sinfully delicious non-veg dishes. But 13 Dhaba is an amazing pure veg Punjabi restaurant, and trust me, the food there won't let you down.

On My Plate: Buttery Aloo Paratha||Paneer Makhani||Raita

The Paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. So imagine how ginormous is. The stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much. The paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices, and the gravy too was amazing. The raita, with a bit of pepper in it added to the beauty of the lunch."
13 Dhaba,Kitty Jain,26 August 2018,1,"I am giving a bad rating not to the restaurant but because of zomato... Everytime I order food the instructions are not properly relayed to the restaurant and I end up getting something which I can't eat(for example spicy or with onions). They simply refuse to cancel the order and even if I ping them separately everytime they say ""system gitch"" .. very bad delivery service by zomato. Zomato clearly doesn't care about it customers but may be they will listen to the restaurants may be because, due to zomato restaurant's name is going for a sale here..."
13 Dhaba,Sudeep Joshi,26 August 2018,3,"Amazing taste. Ordered Chole, Paneer dish and almost all the Naans. Quantity is also good compared to the price. Lassi and Milk Thandai were not so good. But the most important thing why I wouldn't rate it high is it's self service policy. The place is too small and even water isn't served. Not even tissue papers."
13 Dhaba,Friendsrishabh3107,26 August 2018,1,Got dal chawal instead of dal makhni
13 Dhaba,Ganesh Jagwan,26 August 2018,2,paneer paratha's paneer was not good
13 Dhaba,Sreejan Shrivastava,26 August 2018,2,burnt naan
13 Dhaba,Sankalp Chokkarapu,22 August 2018,4,"Got to know about this by watching uber eats vedio and mouth publicity. Perfect place for a punjabi family and AUTHENTIC punjabi food lovers.

The paneer tikka I had here is the Best I ever had till date, it was totally cooked and servered with butter over. Paratas are huge enought to serve one and tests your appettite, stuffing is very good served with butter over and masala ratia.
Reccommend to go with a group so that you can taste all togeather.

Combos and different rice items available. Special 10% discount for bicycle and bullet riders. Self service so get your food own service is too good the person treat with huge respect. Worth visiting the place."
13 Dhaba,Arpit Shrivastava,22 August 2018,2,Quantity of the food is very less for a single person.
13 Dhaba,Subhankar Pattnaik,22 August 2018,5,The Paneer curry & Jeera rice was super awesome. I still cannot forget the taste. Thanks for the treat. Veggie folks do visit the restaurant.
13 Dhaba,Medhavi,21 August 2018,5,D
13 Dhaba,Mukesh Gain,19 August 2018,2,Ordered butter naan.. Completely jalgayaaa and very very difficult to chew and eat.. Not at all goood...Panner makhani is also not al good..
13 Dhaba,Shristi,19 August 2018,1,"I ordered dal makhni , garlic naan and butter roti... It wasn't good at all. It tasted a bit sour.. Like a stale food. Roti n naan were hard to chew."
13 Dhaba,Saket Natrajan,16 August 2018,4,Food was good
13 Dhaba,Ishita Narain,15 August 2018,4,Have ordered from this place a couple of times and I must say that I have not had better alu parathas in Hyderabad than what they serve here. They are filled in so generously (unlike most places) that you can literally see small chunks of potatoes falling from them.
13 Dhaba,Abhinitamasih5,11 August 2018,5,Fast delivery and taste is really superb
13 Dhaba,Victojayasish Paul,09 August 2018,5,very good guy thank you.
13 Dhaba,Priyanka Mantri,07 August 2018,5,good

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vignesh Thyagarajan,22 May 2019,1,"Very bad taste including Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian. Deserts were stale. Paneer was like rubber. AC was not working, and very bad service..."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sheeny Yadav,18 May 2019,4,"This one's simple. They have great food, be it whichever cuisine. Especially the starters and my favorite Thai curry. However, they could work on the service. I have been here multiple times. One time we kept waiting for a waiter and nobody was willing to turn up and the other time we got there at 10 pm, and they were trying to get us out the minute we entered, by insisting it will be last order, would we prefer takeaway, so on so forth and this is when they were serving quite a good number of tables.
Full marks on food, none on service. Ambience is that of a typical restaurant in a fancy hotel (you know what I mean)."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vino Kumar,15 May 2019,1,Worst experience with this hotel. Food taste was very bad. No attention from servers. We even doesn't know that there are rotis and icecream. No one bothered to serve. Only peanuts was good among all the food. But for peanuts 1000 bugs is too much. And most special thing is a tile from wall fell down where a customer missed it in a inch. Plz don't sit at the last.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shubham Jain,15 May 2019,1,"Not recommended for sure.. Average quality and highly overpriced. Took eternity to serve chapati, that too cold ones.. Desserts were good as they have menu options.
Overall disappointed."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sachin Goel,15 May 2019,2,Bad experience.. Food is fine but their AC is not working and staff says this is out of their control. We were sweating. Didn't expected this from such reputed restaurant.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Gautham Maheswaran,14 May 2019,4,"Went to this amazing place quite sometime back. It's a very pretty, romantic place for a fine dining experience.

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

Must try: Forest mushroom soup, Crispy corn pepper salt, Quattro Formaggi, Tiramisu

Would actually give it a 4.5/5"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sumit Routray,12 May 2019,5,"Awesome white sauce pasta and chicken pizza. Great place to go. Been here multiple times, pasta is consistently amazing to eat. Plus Zomato gold is great plus."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mandar Gorade,09 May 2019,5,"Had a lovely experience with my daughter at Jonathan's kitchen once again. We love to eat at this place as it has as awesome menu.

We are very happy with the service provided was Yamuna. As she helped in customizing the dishes for my daughter. Thanks"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Harsh Kohli,02 May 2019,5,Very good food and service. Butter garlic prawns are particularly good. Staff (in particular a lady named Yamuna) was very polite and helpful.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,JagmanNit,01 May 2019,3,"Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion.
The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

Will we return? Perhaps not in the near future - the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sujoy Deb,30 April 2019,4,"Been to this place twice-once with friends and ordered ala carte and other with collegues for a buffet- loved both the experiences. The food here is really good.Unlike others, I will start with the dessert-love their creme brule the best and followed by their baked cheesecakes..Have tried their chickn burgers, pizzas and thai cuisine as well--i loved the burgers the best, followed by Thai curry..Buffet was less impressive than ala carte but was happy with the variety-whic included Hyderabadi cuisine apart form meditteranean...must place to visit in Hydereabad."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Divya Sriram,30 April 2019,3,"Went for lunch with friends...ala carte. Liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! We had the Caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; Pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! Penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.
There was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. Overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prateek Shankar,27 April 2019,1,"I think there is no point of taking a buffet here. I took a buffet for the purpose of having mutton curry; but it was spoilt. Hence, there was no benefit from paying 2000 for 2 people.

I took this plate like this. I left this plate like this."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Surya Tej Kanuri,24 April 2019,2,"*over rated? I feel it is. Desserts are good*

Food -3/7
Ambiance -3/7
Service -2/7
VFM - 2/7

Jonathan kitchen had been on my check list for quite some time.. I was very happy when we finally went over a weekend for the buffet..

The early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe.. As we dint want to Go to another restaurant at that time.. We proceeded to have the buffet..

Except for the desserts section which was huge, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the food.. The taste want great and at the same time, the meat had a lot of bones.. service was bad.. There was always a shortage of plates and the dessert spoon they gave me was the highlight of the whole experience.. ü§£"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Jayaram K,20 April 2019,5,"This is by far the best buffet option on weekdays.

The spread is wonderful and quite enjoyable for vegetarians. I loved the pizza and some of the continental starters.

The main course options were also wonderfully flavorful.

And the desert spread also had more than a dozen options.

Not for the weight watchers :)"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vipul Modi,18 April 2019,5,"A great place for pleasant evening dinner, not too noisy.

We ordered a pizza and risotto, pizza was great lots of veggies and nice crispy crust. Risotto was nice and had good texture, not an expert on risotto but liked it overall.

Quality of service is really good though very few people know details about the menu like which dishes are recommended etc.

Ambience 5/5
Food 5/5
Service 5/5"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Navin Krishna Ambati,17 April 2019,4,"Heard a lot about this place and many suggested that it‚Äôs a must try. I finally tried this and it was a LIT. They have a very interesting a la carte menu with food from different cuisines.

The ambiance good and pretty much similar to any fine dining restaurant except wobbling chairs.

I found service quite quick and clean. Food was brought to table right on time. The quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.

Everything I tried were perfectly done and delivered.

Chicken Peking Style, Peri Peri Chicken breast, Fish and Chips, Crispy Veg Uramaki (Sushi)."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Riz & Shanky,16 April 2019,5,"I was invited to this place by one of my friends to have a dinner and experience the hospitality that Jonathan's kitchen provide.

Let me talk about the ambience , the place is very well designed and Maintained. The lighting at the place is very warm and cosy. perfect place to have a romantic outing as well as family time.

Now coming to food , for the starters we ordered tiger prawns , butter garlic prawns , mutton sikampuri kebab, crispy corn.

Out of all the butter garlic prawns were the highlight. I'd go back to this place just for butter garlic prawns.

For the main course we ordered beef steak and rice and dal tadka, though I am not a fan of beef and I don't eat , my friends told that it was too good. Dal tadka was awesome.

Overall this is a perfect place to have dinner and lunch , I'd definately recommend this."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prachi Gandhi,14 April 2019,1,Ordered Achari Paneer Tikka through Dwight and for a restaurant that claims to be a top notch restaurant and charges exorbitant rates for the same....they sent stale stinky paneer tikka which had to be thrown in the dustbin. Extremely disappointed. Money lost and no replacement provided from the restaurant....not worth it!
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mohammed Masih Uddin (Hyderabadi Food Therapy),14 April 2019,5,"#HYDERABADIFOODTHERPAY

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS i loved them as prawns are my fav.

DRAGON PRAWNS - The name itself defines Dragons

This combination can never be wrong, as i feel everyone love this combination.

CHOCOLATE JAMUN WITH ICE CREAM - A Hot choclate brownie topped with ancold ice cream. when you eat this. its so amazing in taste. and everyone who's going to order this would love this desert.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Naman Nishesh,11 April 2019,4,A decent place overall. It has a nice ambience though it can get pretty crowded and noisy during peak hours. The menu is pretty wide-ranged. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a Pasta in main course. Appetizers were not very good. Chilli broccoli was too oily. However the Pasta was really good.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,T R L,11 April 2019,4,My steak experience here was a lovely one. Though I asked for medium rare done steak I was served a well done chunk of chewey meat that I didn't appreciate. The sides however were perfectly made and impressed me all on their own. The light and brightly lit interiors with white flowy curtains that never allow harsh sunlight to make eye contact make this place lovely for a laid back brunch. The eatery has an aura of tranquility that you simply cannot deny.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mayurika Sarkar,10 April 2019,4,"I have heard lot about the place but finally tonight I managed to visit it. They have an interesting and a wide range of a la carte menu and thats what we all were hoping to try out.
The ambiance is similar as of any fine dining restaurant.
I heard reviews about their service being a bit slower, but luckily I did not experience that tonight (might be due to the lesser rush on a weekday night), rather I found the service quite good.
The quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.

Recommendations:
Blackened salmon steak
Rib eye steak (one of the very few places in Hyderabad where they served an actual medium rare steak!!)
Sirloin steak
Cilantro fish
Jumbalaya
Cheese cake with blue berry compote"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sharanya Deshpande,07 April 2019,4,"It was a lovely experience. We ordered kimchi fried rice and exotic assorted veggies with chili basil sauce. Loved both of them. They were properly cooked . Mushrooms in kimchi fried rice were just delicious.
Not to forget the dessert: baked Alaska: it's a must try.
4 stars coz it's quite far. Baring that it's a pretty sweet restaurant"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Raja Atreya,06 April 2019,5,"Went on a Saturday night. Nice cosy place,well lit and classy ambiance. Opted for a'la carte as we had a snack on our way. We were in a little early and found ourselves a good place to sit. Ordered a burger and pizza. Both were lip smacking. Portion size was huge. Absolute VFM. Zomato gold helps keep the place pocket friendly :) Will surely visit again."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Pathakastha666,06 April 2019,3,"I have visited Jonathan's kitchen on many occasions. One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant, their service is not so nice. Also, they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose, however as per their front staff, they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn't have seat in Jonathan's kitchen but the food, menu and staff will all be from Jonathan's. Hence we sat and ordered and later, found out, no gold accepted.
I have tried their buffet, ala cart, Sushi and everything else, Nothing extraordinary. The only benefit is, it is close to my place."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,SS,06 April 2019,1,"Came to get dinner, made a reservation in advance. Sat for the first 10 mins waiting for someone to get a menu and water.. after 20 mins of waiting for water and asking a few times for someone to take the order we decided to leave when no one came. Still no questions asked on why we're leaving. I guess one can plan a visit if they have a lot of time in their hands and or are not hungry. Had heard good things but this experience changes my mind completely. Won't recommend it for the service"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prasun Gokhlani,06 April 2019,4,Go to place for office team dinners. Food is simply amazing with a large variety of dishes being served. felt the lighting can be improved a bit.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,IStay,03 April 2019,2,Did not enjoy our evening at all. Just realised not to order Sushi if it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. Nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Francissalethu,03 April 2019,4,The place has a nice vibe and the dishes are really tasty and they have a lot of options in buffet. Very nice ambience and polite waiters. The place little pricey but good to go with family.

VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me

Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz üëç

THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS
By far one of the best butter garlic prawns I had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......üëå

TIGER PRAWNS
Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

Minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish

When a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur lifeüòã

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sareet Swain,30 March 2019,5,"One of the few places in Hyderabad to boast of delicious cuisines, amazing ambienence and splendid live music. A big shout to Surendra , for the exceptional service. They offer a wide spread of dishes and drinks.we had gone for buffet and enjoyed the night thoroughly. Would definitely recommend any foodie!!!"

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rupa Lakshmi Nallamalli,28 March 2019,1,"Very bad service, food was not good. They took lot of time for clearing the plates, arranging tables.  Had to pay the money without bill. not worth at all for that price."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anita Majhi,28 March 2019,5,"I love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet. However I have never had the buffet so I wouldn‚Äôt comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz I checked that out. I come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their Fish items from the grill section. I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.

Coming to the ambiance, it‚Äôs minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that‚Äôs amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. I definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sakshi Garg,27 March 2019,4,"I have been there for quite a few time now, for brunch, Ala cart as well as only for dessert.

Brunch- They do have a hell variety of items and I am sure you won't be able to taste them all...I liked their starters very much which had egg options, pan cakes, sautee vegetables, idly, dosa and many more.It was fulfilling in itself.If you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money.

Dessert- I went their only for dessert once and had Tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except Tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

Food-5/5
Ambiance-4/5
Service-4/5
Price-4/5"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sumit Arora,25 March 2019,1,One of the worst places to visit ...horrible experience... We waited for 45 min after placing our order and then walked out of the place without eating anything... First they misplaced the order at a time when there was only two other busy tables and then they had the audacity to come with a pizza and offer us and then realize that it was for someone else...
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Foodbite,25 March 2019,5,"Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen

If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it‚Äôs ambiance to food and service, everything‚Äôs top notch.

It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.

Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn‚Äôt much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo‚Äôs before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

Then we ordered some mocktails because it‚Äôs mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.

Then it‚Äôs time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.

But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

Must Try:
Dragon prawns
Butter Garlic Prawns
Tiger Prawns

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kriti Singh,25 March 2019,3,"This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shashank Singh,24 March 2019,1,"This place is overrated donno why it's rating and taste doesn't match. We had a team lunch here. Food looked pleasing with vibrant colors but taste was tasteless please carry salt & pepper along. Only dish which our group enjoyed was curd rice & peanut chat.
Taste , rating & cost has no connection among themselves"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shashank.sunny,24 March 2019,1,I suggest pls pls don‚Äôt visit this place . Such a worst food I never experienced. The worst experience is I found a bug in a blue berry cheese cake and also so many flies . I would rate 0 if i had a chance . No smiling service would again and again suggest don‚Äôt visit this place.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Harika Reddy,24 March 2019,2,"They said it's one of the best buffets in the city and my experience says otherwise.The service of the place can test your patience in manyways when it's packed.Everything that was there in the buffet was icecold from starters to maincourse.Seriously guys..??!! Huge disappointment this one was.Been here for lunch on holiday,even though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a table.Service, i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it's understandable and afterall they are human.This one was unacceptable.It was a buffet(everything selfservice) only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple times.I walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6.üòÇThe taste of the food in the buffet,total off.Below average spread and taste.Nothing caught my attention to even write about it.The kebabs were all dry,the classic crispy corn was rock hard .The fish curry,i think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravy.Why is it so hyped,i still don't get it.May be i visited this on restaurent's bad day.But it was a bad lunch day for me and my friends.We just know how to have fun in the crisis,good for us,otherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mohammed Asim Khan,22 March 2019,5,"One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.

We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.

Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.

We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.

Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.

We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again."

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ankish Agarwal,15 March 2019,2,"The place had too many mosquitos.
Food was served cold and was below average
Service was not upto the mark.
Ambience was good.
Not worth it."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Saran Kosuru,14 March 2019,2,worst service I ever experienced. If we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it. They will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good. But the people their behaviour and neatness was very very bad. Kindly find the attachment. Thank you and I never visit u.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suraj Soni,13 March 2019,2,"Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk againüòú"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Pintu Lal M,13 March 2019,1,"Worst dining experience I ever had till now.

service staff was extremely rude, so slow that we had to cancel a few items after waiting for 45+ minutes and asking multiple times for it."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Samrat Chakrabarti,13 March 2019,5,"Nice ambiance. This place has a very good fine dining experience. The food is good too. A little expensive but is worth the price. I used zomato gold, so received a nice discount on food."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Tapish Raniwal,12 March 2019,1,We went here for a friend's birthday. The service is extremely bad. The servers routinely forgot orders and various dishes didn't come and they still charged us for the same. We had to fight to get those off the bill. The food is also bland and nothing to write home about. Extremely disappointed. Not at all recommended.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Taleens,10 March 2019,5,Quality of food is really great. Ingredients are top of the line which give a great product. A must visit. Service is equally great. Our food took some time but it was worth the wait. ( The restaurant was busy with the Sunday Brunch and probably alacarte orders need equal attention)
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Saumya Ranjan,10 March 2019,5,"Had a really boring day at office so I invited my friends for a lunch at Jonathon‚Äôs kitchen. The place has a really nice atmosphere. I ordered dragon prawns , which was as nice as it could that I thought of ordering again. My friends ordered soup, which is the most hateful thing by me in food. The prawns were really soft, crunchy and tasty. The vegetables onions, bell peppers were all tasted good due to harmony between the sauces used to cook the prawns. As main course we ordered salmon steak which was really the size of a steak with vegetables and creamy sauce. I, like usual , ordered Indian cuisine which was butter naan and chicken tikka masala which was really suffice for me. The taste was also good. As a whole the food had all the qualities that would make me to visit the place again. It had the taste , the aroma and the visuals were also tempting to try the dish as soon as it‚Äôs served."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Megha Jain,09 March 2019,1,"Bad experience ,the dishes ordered were cold and all were brought together on table i.e. appetizers and main course. Sushi was very bad in taste , pina colada was just mild cold... Chilli broccoli was served dry without any sauces and post requesting 3-4 times the garlic sauce was served. Overall not worth it even one star and my last ever visit."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dileep Vundavalli,09 March 2019,4,"We have to been to this place on a Friday afternoon lunch with my team, the place is so big and it can accommodate more that 100 people in the restaurant.coming to the buffet spread, it was really huge and lot many variety‚Äôs. We got this on a Dineout deal for 550/- which is quite reasonable. Looking forward to visit the place again"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rushikesh Reddy,08 March 2019,2,"Average food not tasty enough and not worth the price of the buffet, better to choose some other option than this until its the only option."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vidul Mathur,03 March 2019,5,"Great place to enjoy your weekend. The food is amazing. Even had live music on Sunday.
We opted for √†-la-carte and ordered Dahi ke Kabab, Thai Basil Praws, Fresh Lime Soda, Strawberry Mocktail, Penne Arrabiata and Chocolate Fondue Cake.
Dahi ke Kababs were very nice and soft like they should be. Thai Basil Prawns were also nice and tasty. They were properly cooked and well served. Fresh lime soda was.....well fresh lime soda but Strawberry Mocktail was super sweet and is a must try. Penne Arrabiata pasta is one dish that I would recommend you all to try here. The gravy was super thick and delicious, the pasta was boiled perfectly and the presentation was also good. Coming to the dessert, I never had such an amazing fondue, not too sweet, just the prefect balance of chocolate and sweetness. Overall had an amazing time here.

Been here twice (this time on birthday) :-p and never regretted the service or food, with live music(they do have a good taste for music) and courteous staff, this place is always buzzing and is on the roll.

checkout offers on buffet and you can strike a good deal if you have a large team visiting, amazing seating options indoors and outdoors,cool bar and buffet counter ,love their starters and live counters with really good varieits and options to choose from!!

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,ARYAN JHA,02 March 2019,4,"Ambience: 5/5 (Both Indoors and Outdoors facility)
Value for Money: 3.5/5 (This is with respect to Sunday Brunch# costing Rs. 1200/- per person)
Staff Service: 5/5

Quality of Food: 5/5 Simply premium.Items I like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.But even more outstanding are their live counter options such as Tawa Fish (Not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. Omelette, French toast, Pancakes were simply brilliant.
Variety of Food: 5/5 Enormous.This is where Jonathan's Kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. They claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#In the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. I couldn't even get my favourite soft drink Thums up (Franchise issue probably, I know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of Pina Colada.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajjit Das,01 March 2019,4,"I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for √† la carte. I was among the two who went for √† la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the √† la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of saut√©d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
Overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ruby Singh,01 March 2019,3,"Lousy staff and lousy service. I went for dinner buffet and except a few things I didn't like anything. The deserts were really really bad. With so many options and none of them were good.
The only good thing is the ambience. I don't recommend this place at all."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Noma Singh,28 February 2019,4,"This is one of the best place if you are looking for a quiet calm place for dinner or lunch .The ambiance is great,staff is excellent and food is to the point. The buffet has nice variety in salads,starters and desert.Main course is average in buffet but a la carte is amazing. The quality of everything served is great.I luv going back to this place."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Chhaya Sharma,25 February 2019,4,"Jonathon's Kitchen was my yesterday's visit and it was good on part of food ...could be excellent if little more they will work on food ...it's ambience is very goo you can sit outside or inside...they have bar area... service is fast..they are always ready to serve you...food varieties are many but little it lacks on taste...for vegetarian people like me they an add some more things or can work a little more on taste...deserts they will kill you with lots of varieties..if you are on diet don't go..haha jokes apart they have good variety of deserts...few were too gud like gulabjamun, rasmalai, etc...cupcakes, were ok ok....but they have many many varieties...icing on the cake was live music....i loved the ambience because of that

My rating Food 4/5
service 5/5
Food 5/5
Overall rating 4.5 /5"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Aishwarya Gupta,23 February 2019,5,"Here you can have a fine dining experience. The food is top notch and the plating is pleasing. There are a lot of options for ve/non-veg in buffet menu. I order sushi and opted for buffet instead of a-la-carte. If you have an appetite for good taste, this place is a must visit. The ambience is also rich.
P.s. - The sushi is a must try!!!!"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Naresh Kodebathula,19 February 2019,3,"I visited this place for a Lunch Buffet recently.

They have wide spread of Starters, Main Course, Veg- Pizza+Pasta on table and huge variety of Deserts.

Food taste was Ok, but nothing different.

They have only butter naan and tandoori roti."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sachit Anand,17 February 2019,4,"They have a very good spread in their buffet. The non-veg dishes have a unique flavour and taste which keeps this restaurant different from others, especially the mexican chicken and fish. All the varieties in veg are good. Ambience and service is excellent."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Hungry Eyes,17 February 2019,5,"This review has been long overdue, I visited this place for my birthday and gawd I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all !! The place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn‚Äôt too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room.
The service is just amazing ! Every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points.
Now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. The food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it Mediterranean or Italian as a matter of fact even Indian.
Now I don‚Äôt want to go into detail with all that I ordered and describe it, I‚Äôll attach images with this review and I‚Äôll let the images talk for themselves albeit I‚Äôd like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with I‚Äôd like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas I‚Äôve ever had in Hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned.
Moving forward I‚Äôd like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I‚Äôd have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
To summarize this I‚Äôd say yes this place is a must visit and I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Devyani Agrawal,14 February 2019,4.5,"Amazing food. The way they serve it will make you even happier. Great presentation of food. Must visit if nearby. Also, not that pocket heavy for a fine dine."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ankita Thakur,14 February 2019,4,"Ambience- very sophisticated.
Food - in terms of variety its great. We had continental. Pastas, Pizza are to die for. Fish and chips were just ok, nothing so great.
Desert- cheesecake is a treat.
And frozen alaska was pretty bad. 1 less star only for that."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Aruna Swetapadma,14 February 2019,5,"I love clean and well lighted restaurants, Jonathan's Kitchen is certainly one of them Soft music, nice and clean seating arrangement appeals you to have a good meal there. I ordered Minestrone alla genovese soup, Thai Green Veg Curry, Agnolotti Pasta and Chocolate Fondant Cake. All were delicious and really lives upto your expectations. I expected the Chocolate Fondant Cake to be bit warm, but it wasn't. Food is amazing."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,FOODGEEK,13 February 2019,1,Got food poison after eating quesadilla yesterday(12/2). Had to admit in hospital for a day had to spend 4k INR. Will never recommend this to anyone.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prashant Agrawal,10 February 2019,4,"Went for a Sunday Brunch with family. The spread is absolutely massive, though veg options were limited, especially Starters. However, the food itself is lip smacking good, no matter what we tried. The staff was courteous, and always available to assist. Ambience was nice, though the live music was a little too loud, for our liking."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prince Kabra,10 February 2019,4,"jonathan's kitchen but jonathan was not there :O

LOL

so, i went there for my anniversary lunch. lovely experience.

we went on a working day (of the week) - and that too in lunch hours,

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish
(a bit pricey u can say)
rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vinay K,09 February 2019,4,"Has got nice ambience and the food tastes good. They‚Äôve got one of the best pesto pastas in the city. Also love the crispy chicken burger, it‚Äôs very tender inside and crispy outside, as said. Blueberry Cheese cake has not had enough ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù, hope to manage to get a better one next time. Very friendly people fo Jonathan‚Äôs.."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Apoorv Srivastava,08 February 2019,4,"After two widely separated visits, I'm positively impressed by Jonathan's Kitchen. Both the lunch buffet as well as the a-la-carte dinner were fulfilling experiences in different manners. While the lunch buffet was simply ginormous, with it being impossible to even taste all the dishes, the dinner was apt for a quiet, relaxed evening with some amazing continental food. 4 stars earned."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sreenivasulu Meda,06 February 2019,3,"This was on my list since few months and finally we went for a Sunday buffet.
Ambience is good with cool music and performance.
Service ok.
Food not satisfied.
My review is only on vegetarian food.
Starters:
There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
Live counter:
Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.
Main course:
I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me. In general, I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mounikagampa,04 February 2019,5,"I went to Jonathan's with team. I fell in love with their ambience and seating. Their buffet spread is good and seats are comfortable. Coming to food, I had the best buffet. Everything is so good"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Alok Kumar Singh,02 February 2019,5,Good Service & polite people... Enjoyed pretty much went in a group of 9 guys... The sunday brunch was cool awesome food and the drinks in package were satisfactory.
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sidharth Singal,26 January 2019,3,"After having dinner buffet here, really wonder hiw come thia place has this rating. Food, service, ambiance...nothing stood out for me. Met friends here for dinner and wasn't impressed. Food is ok, spread is average. Service is good , but thats expected, not exceptional. Most disappointing was the setup. Very average, considering its a above average priced and a hotel restaurant.
Easily avoidable."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shantanu Sharma,26 January 2019,4,"Great buffet. Great food. Good service. Nice location. Is there anything else you desire?
Everything from the service to the food is awesome here! The Fish was especially wonderful.ust go here if you're in Hyderabad!!"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Gaurav Kohli,25 January 2019,5,"Another immensely satisfying experience at Jonathan‚Äôs! If you‚Äôre looking for fine ingredients, a diverse menu, warm and friendly service and most of all a consistent, great taste... you wouldn‚Äôt go wrong picking this place. Highly recommend the lamb murtabak and the pizzas and wild mushroom risotto. Definitely repeat visitworthy."

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun Saraf,17 January 2019,3,"This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember. I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu. 

Ambiance: 3/5
Food: 3.5/5
Service: 2.5/5"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Bhavani Sankar Raju Machiraju,16 January 2019,3,"Ambience is good and food is not that great. We visited the place at 1PM and food is cold and doesn't seem to be good. Compared to the cost, you can prefer flechazo/1983 dhaba/AB's."

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Umesh Kumar,13 January 2019,3,I had recently been to Jonathan's Kitchen based on the Zomato rating and was very disappointed. The food is average in quality. The service is also quite average for the price what they charge. Not going to visit anytime in the future
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ramakanta Mohanty,10 January 2019,4,"(Vegetarian Review on Lunch Buffet)
Pros.....
Great service
Starter and Deserts are the winner here.... satisfied.
Spacious and comfortable.
Main course is.....I can say not bad.

Cons...
Asked for Nan and we got it when we already finished our lunch.
Ice-cream not available. I have asked there but the guy told me there is no ice-cream available. I got to know from my colleague that they serve ice cream on demand. This is wired.

Thank You for your service."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun K,07 January 2019,1,"One of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark!

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...

Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!

The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!

VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

Not going again!"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Apantham,06 January 2019,5,Very nice restaurant.. we tripped on Italian cuisine and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint you.. staff is very friendly and helpful ..there is a live band playing outdoors.. decent enough.. the place also has a very good selection of burgers
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dr.Mahesh Bapuram Reddy,05 January 2019,4,Nice restaurant ! Good burger but the interiors could be better .. very basic interior !they should upgrade the interior ... otherwise nice food I guess
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ankita,02 January 2019,4,"A quick dinner for last Sunday of 2018 landed us in Jonathan's kitchen. We ordered red Thai curry with rice for main course and Fish soy chilli for starter.
Fish soy chilli was spot-on, specially for a wintry night. Thai curry was tasty however rice quantity was quite less for the curry accompanying it.
Ambience is quite good with Oriental decoration"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anshita,31 December 2018,2,"After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Namit Agarwal,31 December 2018,3,"Jonathan's Kitchen is there at the ground floor or Holiday gift Inn Express and Suites.

Ambiance is pretty amazing so is the live music of here. But the food is not as great as you expect from such restaurants.Desserts are good and there is also a quite descent range in it."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Yoga,28 December 2018,4,"We went here for an afternoon buffet. The place was a little crowded because of an office party. Buffet spread is good. The food is tasty. We enjoyed the soup, paneer, veg balls, dhal makani, Veg biriyani. Dessert has variety and quite good. We enjoyed the food. Ala Carte seemed to take time. The table next to us was occupied the same time as us but were served when we were on desserts."
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,John Nikheth Chiluvuri,27 December 2018,5,"It was on my birthday I visted this place.
Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..
We ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu, suggested by waiter.. both of them tasted good.. :) waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints..
Overall it was a nice dinner on an occasion of birthday.."

Miss Yamuna ,the hostess especially ! I would recommend this place to everyone out there..."
B-Dubs,Srishti Dubey,25 May 2019,5,"The best place to be if you want to see some sport screening.
What I really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 5-6 screens which will be clearly visible.
No fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

We went here during IPL screening.
It was really a great experience.

What we had ordered was ultimate nachos,chicken wings with Chipotle sauce and pizza.

Everything was really delicious.

Portion were quite good for two.

I feel it's bit over priced but worth it..!!

Service is excellent,staff is very warm and friendly.

4.5/5 :)"

Try visiting in non-busy hours as you'll be able to get more Game-on time.
A Bit expensive though, but that really justifies the PS, XBox abd VR experience."

B-Dubs,Pratipurna Panda,29 April 2019,3,"Sooo... It's a sports bar. On the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. Very lit... Bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!

Hope to visit again soon.. to a nice ambience üòä"

Amul,Anupam Acharya,17 May 2019,4,"We had ordered from Amul and we will order again. We were looking for a late night binge and found Amul on Zomato. We ordered some Choco Chips (5/5) and Alphonso Mango (5/5) ice cream and loved them. Only thing is, the ice creams (although provided with dry ice) had started melting which wasn't desirable. I wish Amul can improve their packaging so that ice cream reaches intact."
Amul,Suresh Kumar,17 May 2019,5,Thank-you for serving testy milkshakes in late night I am suggesting my friends to try milkshake in this place specialy dry furit milkshake...
Amul,Aditi Bhaiji,30 April 2019,4,"Although I didn't go to the onsite store, but I have ordered some ice cream üç® from there . They are too yumm üòãüòã. One can have them whenever they wish too.
I am very much impressed with there style of packing the food .
The service was also good . The items were delivered on time .
The taste is dam good and they have a wide variety of flavors with them .
They make sure that the icecream didn't melt by the time it reaches to the customer , that made me cheerful.üòÅ"
Amul,Buddiga Sindhuri,19 April 2019,4,"This is a small ice cream parlour.It has all good ice cream and I ate death by chocolate in this their hot brownie and on that hot chocolate sauce was their and scooped with 3 icecreams and it is around 170rs.I ate ice cream mixed with chocolate brownie its like heaven for me.It is topped with choco chips and choco sticks.ya amul maintained its quality.They gave more in quantity and 3scoops were to much to me.
Food 5/5
Ambience 2/5
packaging 5/5
Overall 4/5"
Amul,Prashanth Kumar,13 April 2019,5,Ordered Nutty Fruity Ice Cream which is mango and strawberry crazy combination and the roasted almonds which is awesome in this hot summer and the delivery boy done a great job but the packing was in plastic cover which usually delivered in Amul branding cover just saying but still i don't mind until the ice cream was good and Great Job Amul !!! Excited to have more ice creams in this hot summer.
Amul,Ayushman Shukla,31 March 2019,1,"I am a regular customer when it comes to ordering from amul. I ordered ""all chocolate ice cream"" from amul. According to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it. It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet."
Amul,Sumanth,30 March 2019,1,"Have ordered from here so many times but when i got the wrong order the restaurant doesnt trust me and expects me to go through a hassle so that they ll get convinced and send me the correct item...(asked for Anjeer and got something else,sent a photo to zomato and the restaurant wants me to talk to someone else and take their number and send then photos and wait for their reply,no one has so much time and customer service shud be easier"
Amul,Chitti,29 March 2019,5,thank you... delivered on time
Amul,Avishek Chakrabarty,28 March 2019,5,"We have ordered ice creams multiple times from Amul. Love the variety available on their menu. Quantity is really good, more than what I get when ordered from other Ice Cream parlours. Value for money with great taste."
Amul,Simanto Bagchi,16 March 2019,4,"Ordered Tropical Sunrise Sundae with chocolate syrup base, choco chips and Fruit poison ice cream. Both were mind blowing. Fruit poison had exotic fruits like kiwi and strawberry and tasted really well. The tropical sundae had a cocoan and dark chocolaty after-taste. They know their stuff well and I will prefer their items over Cream stone for sure."
Amul,Vivek Andhavarapu,09 February 2019,1,"Need to improve the food quality. Ordered Hot Choclate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream which was not good. Bownie was hard, no hot choclate found. Vanilla ice cream alone was good."
Amul,Abhishek Sengupta,19 January 2019,1,very late delivery
Amul,Madhavi Thanniru,06 January 2019,5,The best place for icecreams. I love it. You should try choco brownie almond for sure. Quantity n quality is amazing. Availble always for online orders
Amul,Saurabh,01 January 2019,4,Amul Ice-cream. Tastes best. I've tasted many flavours from the menu. Delivery is also coolüòé with the dry ice covers the ice-cream. I must recommend to try all the flavours. They have from budget to premium Ice cream.üòãüòã
Amul,Udit Patel,08 December 2018,5,"Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!
Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)"
Amul,Alekhya,18 November 2018,3,tutty frooty icecream is not good
Amul,Chitti,14 November 2018,5,delivered the food on-time.. thanks

Amul,Charushila Biswas,03 November 2018,2,Ordered death by chocolate and received butterscotch and some other ice cream! Giving two stars because zomato doesnt show the reviews that receive 1 star.
Amul,Shivanand K,31 October 2018,3,"Amul brand is good for milk but not for ice creams.
They tried too hard to fit in but could not match the creaminess of other brands.
Coming to the outlet they hardly have 5 varieties ... sadly had to choose one among them."
Amul,Varun Vanna Reddy,28 October 2018,5,on time delivery very nice thank you
Amul,Shalem Raju,19 October 2018,5,Timely Delivery
Amul,Shreya Soni,15 October 2018,5,"Nutella brownie blast thick milk shake - i would rate this 4.5 because I was expecting some brownie piece in it, I liked the taste , thickness was also perfect... Over all would suggest people to try thisüòã"
Amul,Junaid Ali,15 October 2018,1,I had this ice cream tooty-fruity. It was so horrible. There were pieces of something that were tasteless and they put so much nuts and other bullshit that the only thing that was okay the actual ice cream I couldn't have the taste of that too. I literally puked the entire thing after having a severe stomach ache. DO NOT HAVE TOOTY-FRUITY unless it's just a scoop with no add-ons.
Amul,Karishma Bhatt,03 October 2018,4,"Genrally i don't eat ice creams, but have tried today Brownie blast ice cream which was very good in taste. You will find varities of ice creams . Its very much pocket friendly . The delivery was also on time, Since i ordered online."

The ferrero Rocher based gelato is a must-try"
Amul,Himanshu Sahu,16 September 2018,5,"I really like the place for Maggie, ice cream and a good place to enjoy that food, I really appreciate the service here , the ambience is good."

Amul,Shafia Shams,07 September 2018,4,"This place is a savior for mid night cravings.
I have tried the chocolate sundae, brownie with ice cream and many basic flavours like mango,belgium chocolate,choco chip chocolate,butterscotch and strawberry.
Taste is good , I am only disappointed with the brownie its more like chocolate sponge cake . The portion size is appreciable for the price. Looking for budget ice cream , this place is great for it."
Amul,Harsha Sadhu,26 August 2018,5,"Awesome and wonderful place, I had ordered frequently from this place and visited this place a lot times. My top charts for ice-creams were Apsara, Cream stone and Naturals. After getting familiarized with this place this stood top among my top chart. 

Pros: Pocket friendly yet high quality ice creams, Delivered with dry-ice so delivery experience was good and it did not melt, Can visit for ice cream late night, value proportion for money
Cons: Having there is not that great as place is small"
Amul,Deepak Chadha,25 August 2018,5,"Great place to hangout, chilling, great ambience, Good Service, fresh fruit ice creams. Specially fruit poison ice cream, Thick shakes are amazing."

Lovely idea and great sense of packing compared to all the ice cream deliveries. Must order guys. I have ordered a lot of times from here.
Amul,RahulRaji,14 August 2018,1,worst taste

Amul,Sheshank Reddy,09 August 2018,1,They are just making people fools.I orderd for belgium chocolate ice cream they gave me normal chocolate with some chocolate syrup on it.owner is too rude as well.I asked him then he said that it will get same taste as belgium chocolate.Better to go to another outlet nearby
Amul,Archana Jha,07 August 2018,5,on time... great delivery...
Amul,Saketh Ram,07 August 2018,1,"The staff was very ill mannered and have no respect towards customers. 6 of us went there to dine in and ordered plenty. One of our friends brought butter milk from the next store and sat along with us. He could have told politely that outside food was not allowed. But he asked him to get out in a mannerless way. We cancelled the order and walked away.

Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.

Profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. Not the other way around.

I wouldn't suggest a visit to this place if you are not ok with this kind of treatment."

Amul,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),31 July 2018,4,"Friday Night must desserts-
Amul has an outlet near DLF CyberCity Gate 2, Gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. This place is small and has less number of tables available. It is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background. People love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at DLF.
They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.
Overall -
A casual place to on every weekend for the desserts along with the friends."

SKYHY,Manisha Rao,24 May 2019,1,Starters was ok to taste but after effect lasted for days. The colour of the stools was black for almost 5 days from the day we visited that place. My friends experience after having those starters was horrible.She was admitted in hospital.
SKYHY,Vigil Venugopal,23 May 2019,4,The biggest screen in town with a lovely rooftop. But portion size and value for money takes a dip. They have different rules on zomato gold or Dineout. Pricy too !
SKYHY,Ram Prakash Reddy,12 May 2019,1,"the name resembles this place with their prices(Skyhy).Very bad experience, worst food, worst service. We ordered spicy grill chicken, we couldn‚Äôt differentiate whether it was chicken or some other cheap meat. The fish fingers were oily as Hyderabad‚Äôs summer sweat! üòÇ. I would rate 0/5 for this place"
SKYHY,Susmitha Penisetti,11 May 2019,3,"I have been to this place with my friends on a Friday evening as they had Bollywood night starting from 8.
The food was average. They didn't even had Breezer which is disappointing. The service was not that great.
As mentioned earlier, They has Bollywood night which didn't even start till 10pm.
Finally,
Food - 2.5
Ambience - 3
Service - 3
Menu and pricing - 3"
SKYHY,Shailesh Pachbhai,11 May 2019,3,"I visited this place on Friday, but I don‚Äôt like food and service provided. I ordered barbecue chicken but it was not cooked properly but I liked the ambiance and open terrace."
SKYHY,Nikunj Keshav,10 May 2019,4,I have been to this restaurant to see my friend. The place is well situated on the main Gachibowli road near by the flyover. Ambience was nice and the taste of food is good too. We order a cheese balls in the started and a veg sizzlers. Sizzler was amazing and sumptuous. Recommend this place to visit once at least.
SKYHY,Abhinav Kulshrestha,06 May 2019,4,"Been here a lot of times and it's a place to go to when weather is nice as its in the open.
Food is good and menu has decent choices.
Dance floor is limited to couples though or you have to have at least a girl in your group to enjoy dancing."
SKYHY,Hemachand Yadav Gogula,05 May 2019,3,This place is awesome to hangout with friends. I liked the dance floor and the way they serve the food and been polite with customer. But food was average need to improve in that a little.
SKYHY,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,3,"Again I was in dilemma between 3 to 4, place is good and nice terrace. But it's very very small. The night will purely depends on band playing that night. All regular options of menu available. Food is OK and nothing special with drinks but a good evening can be passed through.
OK kind of for your money as I am comparing other places in same area"
SKYHY,Rakesh Dara,28 April 2019,1,If there z an option to give 0 I certainly do that disgusting food ordered multiple option thinking at least this one should be fine but none of the dishes are promising not even close to basic taste avoid this pub nothing means nothing in food and price range is not less...if u dare to go after looking into this review no one can‚Äôt stop u . worst experience ever had..
SKYHY,Siddhanta Dey,28 April 2019,5,Been there on a Saturday night and the atmosphere was electrifying. This place has a nice rooftop sitting area and also a dance floor. Excellent service.
SKYHY,DNiharikaa,21 April 2019,4,"One of good open terase place in town.

Food was good, mood uplifting dance floor.

To hangout with friends it is a great place to visit ü§üüèΩü§üüèΩ"
SKYHY,Gordon,15 April 2019,1,Been there with friends. They took 2 hours to get a starter. No lights and he refused to turn on lights. Regret visiting this place .. I will not go there again
SKYHY,Buddha Sudeep,13 April 2019,1,"The worst behaviour of staff, we are seating on rooftop and went to dance floor leaving our belongings at our table and one Stuart comes and asks us credit card as deposit. What kind of service is this, in last 12 years i have visited 100s of pubs in India no one asked such. Dear SKYHY if u think u r one of top pub, listen there are more which give better service than you."
SKYHY,Raja Gopal Reddy Chereddy,09 April 2019,5,"The most happing place for me.. multiple visits because of their terrace seating and large screen.
Multiple match's I watched here with my friends.
As compared to multiple places in hyd, it's bit costly but worth it."
SKYHY,Akhil,08 April 2019,5,"Wanderfull place. nice hospitality
amazing dance floor
good food
friendly staff
I really enjoy
Skyhy is one of the best pub in Hyderabad
I love this place"
SKYHY,Palak Jain,06 April 2019,4,"Awesome place for couples to visit... Not so loud... Just if u wanna have a romantic date and chitchat with ur partner in dim lights with not so disturbing crowd this is the perfect destination....

The food they serve is awesome... Specially jalapeno cheese poppers.. and best thing live sport screening if you are a fan..."
SKYHY,Madhuri,05 April 2019,3,"Had peri peri chicken and dragon chicken starters.... Taste is OK.... Peri peri chicken served with fries but not spicy and dragon chicken is spicy and sweet sauce mixed....
With zomato Gold had a good experience...
Ambience - 3/5
Food - 3/5
Quality - 3/5
Quantity - 4/5
Management and waiters are good in service becoz we went in weekday so didn't had any problems.... One best thing to watch cricket on screen on terrace....
At last had a great time with friends..."
SKYHY,Niranjan Kumar Muthineni,31 March 2019,1,Worst place to be on a Saturday evening. Service was slow and there were hardly 3 tables with close to 30people in the whole of SKYHY. Two people were serving and 5 waiters were busy watching IPL. This was my first visit and for sure the last visit. I would not even give 1 start but had no other options!!!‚Äô
SKYHY,Madhusha Urlam,29 March 2019,3,"DJ floor is the best part of Skyhy üíÉ
The name of the lounge is justified with a decent rooftop.
IPL and T20 times are the best to visit this place
Although the food and drinks quality need to be improved on a little as we had bad experiences for couple of visits"
SKYHY,$ign,11 March 2019,4,"Had the long island and the salsa nachos, bothered excellent, the nachos were delicious with a smoked after taste which was fantastic, the music and ambiance was on point and honestly first place iv seen who provielde sugar cane stick as a sterer it's a genius idea, good to chew on when you wait for your food! But more than anything it was the manager of the outlet who took the cake in terms of service stand up chap, props to him!"
SKYHY,Manisha Panda,11 March 2019,4,"Well went to this place on a ladies night so drinks were on house! Yayy for that ü§ü
All we had to buy was starters which were really good. The ambience is good; not sure about the rooftop as we didn't land there. Good DJ. Good service.
I'm saying good at every sentence cause it was not exceptional even though it was a pretty decent club.
Would suggest to go check out for once üòä"
SKYHY,Neha Singh,10 March 2019,4,"I prefer outdoor. Music is good. Perfect for out dine with friend and can enjoy live match, if you like. Choose wisely from menu ( food), drink is fine!"
SKYHY,Arhan Khan,09 March 2019,5,The best place to have fun and hang out with frind for a drinks . ...bar tender silu awesome make cocktail anf shoot food also good snd service
SKYHY,Mayur Chawla,09 March 2019,1,"Worst service. Kept us waiting for food but didn't had the courtesy to inform. After waiting for almost an hour we had to cancel. Management is very incompetent .Name of manager- Umakant.
Disappointed
...
Worst experience"
SKYHY,Sonali Singh,08 March 2019,1,"Pathetic. Unprofessional staff. Bouncers will make you wait for 15-20 mins at the entrance even if you have made an advance booking for office party. Moreover, they ask to call any member from your group who is already in to verify whether booking is done or not, party is going on or not. If it was my personal party I would have immediately cancelled the booking and have gone somewhere else."
SKYHY,Prasanna,07 March 2019,1,They don't have any options.. they have an elaborate menu but have very few options available. Waste of going there... Service was not good too.... Cocktails were costly but they don't taste good at all...
SKYHY,Aanya Sharma,06 March 2019,1,"Very overpriced diluted drinks. On complaining the bartender said, it has very high alcohol content, blah blah and we don't know how the cocktails are made. Very arrogant and rude staff. The order took forever to come. Not sure if this is a Saturday night rush issue or a regular thing. 
When our order finally arrived, they got it wrong.
The dance floor was very crowded and some people were pushing us.

The only good part was 2+2 with zomato gold.

In the final bill, they charged us for 6 extra drinks and refused to update bill.
If you are a party of 4-5 people, please avoid this place."
SKYHY,Dhritipriya Biswas,04 March 2019,4,"I went there on sat night with my friends to have a fun weekend.... the place was lit . Ambience was amazing ... they have a rooftop arrangemnt where u can sit and njoy ur drinks and then be ready to move those feets with the cool dj ...
We ordered a couple of whiskey & beer, one cocktail named cosmopolitian and a mocktail...
The dj shut down at around 12.30 to 1 am ...
Overall i had a blast and the place is really cool for all those who love to party"
SKYHY,Soujanya Reddy,02 March 2019,2,"Ok place for casual hangouts.

Food wasn‚Äôt so great, it was ok ok. There weren‚Äôt many options for drinks as well. Service was also not so great I would say."
SKYHY,Nikhita,28 February 2019,3,"I had been to this place last weekend with family. I must say the service is excellent. Coming to the ambience, the dance floor and the area beside that looks great, but the rooftop wasn't that interesting. 1 less star only for that. But other than that the food was good but not that great. We ordered:
1. Budweiser (3)
2. Virgin Mojito (2) - It was soooooo good.
3. Chicken Tikka - Could have cooked more.
4. Crispy chicken Asian Style
5. Dragon Chicken
6. Chicken pulao - Same as Biryani nothing great

Overall, I feel a little more work to be put into deco on the rooftop & a little on food. But a good open air experience. Best if you come as a couple. The dance floor will be open to you."
SKYHY,Prakash Gudipati,26 February 2019,1,Pitchers and towers are not available.but they are present in the menu.we have ordered chicken wings.they are not hot and even chicken is smelling foul and is not fresh.highly dissapointed.dont know what management is doing
SKYHY,Snigdha Uppala,25 February 2019,1,"Went there for an office party.
The DJ was so bad. He didn't play any requested songs.
He mixed all the songs which didn't set the mood right and ruined all the trippy songs by making them fast and adding beats eg for Manali trance, he made it fast. Totally ruined the mood of the crowd. Didn't play as we requested even though we had bookd the place. Horrible."
SKYHY,Neha Rathi,21 February 2019,3,Came for office party.. food is just okay.. they have dance floor also.. ambiance is okay not very great.. maybe top floor have better ambiance.. overall ok ok place..
SKYHY,Sudhansu Mishra,20 February 2019,3,"Pub was superb...rooftop, great ambiance, good music , dance floor but food was ok..most of the popular drinks was not available ‚òπÔ∏è.. overall goodüòä"
SKYHY,Sanjaya Behera,16 February 2019,4,"A beautiful set up ambience,fancy setup, great interior,flashy menu,decent food, fantastic service,and worth of money.
We went yesterday you can't believe the food test is so good than others restaurant making
Finally we enjoyed it"
SKYHY,Yashwanth Varakala,04 February 2019,3,"Nice place with an awesome ambience.
Delicious food and customizations are considered.
Service must be improved as I didn't found any one to guide or receive when I entered (12:30pm)"
SKYHY,Srikanth Gogineni,03 February 2019,5,Cocktails are awesome. Great ambience. Food is good. Fish starters are tasty. I seated at rooftop. Nice place to hang out with friends and colleagues.
SKYHY,B Sridhara Subudhi,03 February 2019,3,Ambience in here is nice it's my go get hangout place and sure about food it's good .. good for casual and team especially when there is a match coz it's got a big screen with open roof top space.
SKYHY,Vishal Macha,02 February 2019,3,I been to this with my office colleagues. Everything's seems perfect expect the DJ in this bar. They need to improve on this asap. Drinks are little expensive
SKYHY,Heeranmayee Sahoo,30 January 2019,3,"Food is horrible , cost( both bar and food ) are too costly and the taste of food don't justify the price.but ambiance is okay , music is nice . Good place for drinking but food ! Ah ah no"
SKYHY,Kunal Ashok Duggal,27 January 2019,5,"Its a great place to visit with a couple of friends for some drinks and food. The staff is very cooperative and helpful. The crowd is okay. The ambience is the thing I liked the most. An open terrace option just adds up to the charm of the night. All in all, its among the best places in Hyderabad to have food and drinks. So let the drinks pour in! Cheers!"
SKYHY,Venu Gopal,23 January 2019,3,"been here couple of times on weekdays, it has both open area and closed area too the ambience was nice. the quality of food is ok ok...DJ was good. The service was fine but you are not valued if you are going as a stag... After spending some time felt its too cold outside so asked if I can go to closed area but they refused even after requesting which made me to leave the place earlier.

Food:4/5
Ambience:4.5/5
Music:4.5/5
Service:3/5"
SKYHY,ImFoodie,13 January 2019,4,"I have been here during some ODI match.
Have used little coupon, which really helped our pocket. There are 2 sittingareas, one outside where they had put screens and inside which is dance floor in suppose, i opted for out sitting.
One by one we tried almost all the veg starters with cocktails.
Everything was just perfect. Match drinks and snacks.I definitely recommend this place.
So here are my ratings
Food: 4*
Ambience: 4*
Pocket friendly: 3* google all deals/coupon options, and you will be mpre than happy."
SKYHY,Ravirams1979,04 January 2019,1,"Went to skyhy with great expectations but pathetic service and very bad food quality.wasted almost 1hr for food to arrive ,and they served the wrong item.

Very disappointed,will not prefer to return again"
SKYHY,Kashyap Tadikonda,29 December 2018,5,"Ambience and dance floor are primary attractions at the restaurant.
Zomato coupons are pretty well acknowledged.
Drinks are really worth with Zomato inclusion.
Both veg & non-veg starters are delicious.
Worth for the money"
SKYHY,Bhavika Pandya,27 December 2018,3,"Place is nice , it has open area on terrace and closed area too. Have been here twice and found that the service is nice but the quality of food is not that great. DJ was good. And once out of 2 times, have experienced power cut and the team was not able to have the backup for 30mins. But this might be a one off case so should be fine. Its an average place to be there."
SKYHY,Samrudh Kelkar,26 December 2018,5,"Chilled out place for office party. Went at 6pm and place was super quiet. If you have good company and want to have relaxed drinking experience, go before 7 pm. Zomato Gold works well, you can pay using dineout app. Staff is super cool."
SKYHY,Jagrati Kothari,24 December 2018,3,"Non veg wasn‚Äôt good at all. Ordered fish, chicken wings, both were vry bad.
Veg was good though, ordered chilly mushroom and crispy corn. Chill mushroom ws exceptionally good"
SKYHY,Vicky Rockzz,23 December 2018,1,"Worst place went soo far, don't believe in pictures, quality of food is worst, dj was very very very bad. Disgusting place. Seen in zomato impressed with pictures but came to a worst place"
SKYHY,Mohit Munikuntla,22 December 2018,4,"Coming to the tast. It was above average can't say the best. But tastes good enough.
But when it comes to serving, the boys are very slow need to improve"
SKYHY,Sthiti Chakraborty,22 December 2018,4,"Food : 4
Ambiance : 4
Service : 4
Pocket pinch : around 9k for 9 people with 6 Zomato golds and around 15 starters.

I went in a group of 9 people on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty. They were playing nice funky music and the ambiance was really nice. The service was fine like any other party place had and the taste of food was also decent. Even though we were 9 people, they allowed us to use 6 Zomato golds and I really appreciate it‚ò∫Ô∏è

The corn and cheese triangles were awesome.
The food was served really hot and the place would be fun when there is right crowd.

Overall, a good experience."
SKYHY,Varunkumar Reddy,20 December 2018,3,"The best hangouts place with friends and girlfriend and it had good dance floor. I got good variety of liquor brands also but the food is main concern in terms of both taste and quantity.for quires contact sujith_reddy12 in instagram
SKYHY"
SKYHY,Madhup,19 December 2018,5,Went with friends here. The food is really good. Went on to the dance floor and it was a nice experience. The view from the roof is really nice.
SKYHY,Saurabh Kumar,08 December 2018,1,"They did not allow entry at 11:07pm today, just saying that they allow till 11pm why then it's mentioned that we can enjoy till 1 am ????????? That too on saturday ???"
SKYHY,Gaurav Lohani,03 December 2018,3,Food was mediocre and had to wait an hour just to get the starters. A rooftop devoid of a view . Only good thing about the place was the dance floor .
SKYHY,Rajat Soreng,01 December 2018,1,Whoever is a stag remember that you won't be allowed in 5th floor even though you have booked through zomatoand they recommend you to 4th floor masti sports bar.bad experience.i won't recommend this place to anyone.Stay away
SKYHY,Pratipurna Panda,29 November 2018,3,"Good for group outings. They provide rooftop seating arrangements.
Music can be better for the dance floor. Ambience is okay. Food is average. Good staff though. They are helpful and friendly."
SKYHY,Anusha Panguluri,27 November 2018,1,"Just because a bunch of corporate guys request for retro songs, you shouldn't ignore the rest of the crowd. Please consider it serious! Food is ok."
SKYHY,Prashant J Neelaraddi,18 November 2018,4,"Amazing chef. Order anything in fish, It will be utterly tasty. I would call it a best place for ambience and music is perfect. Visited twice, pretty descent crowd. Delay in service. Due to lack of staff HEADCOUNT. All it comes to your starving, cz u need to wait for it. Never stop yourself to visit this place."
SKYHY,SriNaresh Gavarasana,18 November 2018,4,"Delicious food with good quantity.

Yesterday was the first time we been there at SKY HY. It is a good place to spend some quality time with your friends and loved ones. The food was great and delicious. The place is not like a typical pub where in you can get drunk and have good food but it is more like a place wherein you can chit chat and hang over. Coming to the food, we had Paneer tikka, chicken majestic, and chicken tikka pizza which are execellent in taste they are delicious."
SKYHY,Sai Vadapalli,13 November 2018,3,Been here on a Saturday evening. The service looked a bit slow but the food tasted good. They allow stags without any cover charge but they don‚Äôt let you enter the dance floor if you‚Äôre one. The staff is also very co-operative. Go here as a crowd and you would love it.
SKYHY,Santhosh GR,04 November 2018,4,"Good place for a open air n music with nice barmans special drinks!
nice music and dance accordingly basis your crowd, MUST TRY ON BARMANS SPECIAL!‚ù§Ô∏è"
SKYHY,Chandann Reddy,04 November 2018,4,Great ambience and perfect roof top bar!!! Good service and decent variety of liquor and super pocket friendly!!! Must visit to unwind!!! The food what ever I ordered was ok (no complaints). Visit here to unwind!!! One suggestion pls change the live band if the original artists hear them they will all kill them selves!!!!!!
SKYHY,Sharukh Khan,04 November 2018,1,Me and my friends were at this pace for Saturday club night. Dance floor is spacious .Ambience is good .Overall my experience was good though there was delay in our order
SKYHY,Sarika Indukuri,31 October 2018,5,The place is cool and the person who served us (Sahoo) is too good. Nice place to visit again and chill out. Nice place to hang out with friends
SKYHY,Mallik Arjun,30 October 2018,3,"5 of us had been to dis place on 27th night, good place, decent set up, food is good, DJ is good, parking,lift area poor,conjusted weekends."
SKYHY,Himakar,29 October 2018,5,Nice ambience with roof top and good music..good place to hangout with friends for parties in the weekends ... Mr. Sahu's assistance is appreciable...
SKYHY,Hyderabad Food,26 October 2018,5,"Lovely food
Lovely drinks with's make silu

Please don't forget to visit this place if u, re in gachibowli. for the most happening nigh
This please will never disappoints you."
SKYHY,Tanushree Karan,25 October 2018,4,"This place has amazing setup, separated in multiple sections. So one can have romantic dates, casual Hangouts, DJ dance parties.
I love the interior n decor of the place. It looks quite classy. They can do it bit better though.
There are multiple events going on this place, make it more interesting. The dance floor is big and closed to give u the thumping sound. There is a huge screen for live matches.

Food: I have loved the food here be it veg or non veg. Fish is quite good. The masala level is decent. Liquor collection is good. But I don't find cocktails much interesting here.

Value for money: the price is pretty decent compared to the peer pubs. Food menu is very reasonable.

The service is good. Front desk receptionists are helpful in getting you a seat."
SKYHY,Hyderabad Food,20 October 2018,5,"everything one needs. Seating at Fully friendly bar man ..sillu.....? Thank u for your service n drink

biggest place gachiwali area n quality of food was delicious we really testy and service is very fast‚ûï . Overall 5 to 5 we definitely recommende.?......?......."
SKYHY,Nupur Rani,11 October 2018,3,"Was there for dinner on a weekday. The ambience is sombre. They have a wide variety of menu ranging from European to Chinese to Hyderabadi biryanis. Tried the Virgin guava Mary mocktail,which was really good. The chicken quesadillas were delicious. We also had spicy chicken sizzlers which was also good. Had an overall good experience."
SKYHY,Tarun Nayak,07 October 2018,5,"I'll not be here next time if Mr. Umakant is not here next time. Super service and awesome place. Great staff. Had an awesome time.

Love this place."
SKYHY,Sarthak Garg,07 October 2018,5,"It was an awesome experience. Umakant

SKYHY,Rashmi Rekha,06 October 2018,5,"Courteous staff, good food, and lovely vibes.
Sahoo was a lovely company for the night.
Sunday is ladies night and live band for your information.
Monday is all alcohol on MRP."
SKYHY,Manish Dash,06 October 2018,2,"This place is okay at best. The drinks are too diluted with an extra crapload of ice. The live music was really great but didn't fit inside such a place. Cibo house is a much better place if you're looking for some good live music, a peaceful time and some great drinks with friends."
SKYHY,Vishwanath Rao,06 October 2018,5,"i have been hearing some really good reviews about this  place, The ambience is  happening..On a lucky Sunday night you get to hear live band too.."
SKYHY,Robin Tyagi,06 October 2018,1,"Very bad place to hang on, the staff is very arrogant and short tempered. They don't allow entry to stags on the dance floor also and despite of so high prices haven't given any discount even not corporate discount too."
SKYHY,Achuta Nanda Jena,05 October 2018,1,"Don‚Äôt ever go to this place, waste of money, if you give order the order will come after 45 mins. Behaviour of the staff is horrible, the partner/owner even don‚Äôt know about how to behave to customer."

SKYHY,NIHAL VK,04 October 2018,1,Very bad management. They are a cheat. Firstly they denied me the 20% flat discount coupon which i had taken from dine out. Over charged our liquor. Never going back there ever again.

SKYHY,Skandha Krishna,29 September 2018,5,"Nice place to hang out with friends. It has live cricket screening, quite big screen. Food orders are served within 10 mins, quite quick. Good ambience. Good service. It is a place to revisit."
SKYHY,Ishita Narain,28 September 2018,2,"Firstly the pictures that they have put up makes this place looks brightly light but it is kind of dark and the ambiance is not exactly as portrayed. Not very crowded which makes it spacious enough. Food is okay but the service was pathetic. When asked for spoons, the waiter asked us to use the serving spoon instead. There was a lot of delay in service and mismanagement."
SKYHY,Bhrigu Kapur,26 September 2018,5,"The staff is professional and courteous. A shout out to
Sahoo for the excellent service!
Great ambience with good food.
A really nice experience."

SKYHY,Nithisha Reddy,24 September 2018,4,"Had been to this place with friends on Saturday night! Decent place! Decent crowd. The only turn off for this place was their Music! It was boring. Dance floor is decent! You wont bump into one another like elsewhere.
Food also was average. Not that great.

Food: 3/5
Ambience: 4/5
Staff and Service: 3/5
Recommended: Yes"
SKYHY,Souvik Raha,24 September 2018,5,"Went there this Saturday. Awesome dj, dance floor is spacious.. you dont really bump into people. Food was good to average.

SKYHY,Damini Wadhwa,20 September 2018,4,The place is really nice. Devashish helped us in all best way. I would love to go ther more often since the staff and the place is really nice.
SKYHY,Himakar Yv,20 September 2018,2,"TLDR : an avg place with  moderately expensive drinks  ( a LIT in pictures at 550  ) A nice club with good ambiance , but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a SATURDAY night . It was a happening place earlier , which couldn't cope up with new upcoming competition around it . The chicken wings were undercooked . The only good thing about the place was the energetic DJ with crazy numbers & the dance floor . The staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me & another blogger from taking pictures & videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstyle/food bloggers (maybe they might have had a misconception initially ) ."
SKYHY,Ram Chandra,19 September 2018,5,"Just don't go by rating...

It's an AWESOME experience.

Umakant is just awesome.....served to the satisfaction of 16 guys...

Music is too cool...

Party was just Grrreaaaaattt"

SKYHY,Gregory Allen,15 September 2018,5,Having a great time and excellent service by Saboo. This place is a must. Excellent drinks and very good pizza. Come join us some time. See you there.
Tiki Shack,Anshul Gupta,25 May 2019,1,"A very bad experience. I went here with my team, but the staff made sure that we had the worst experience. The food was cold, served very late. Drinks were of bad quality. Staff behavior was also very bad."
Tiki Shack,Anshul Gupta,25 May 2019,1,"Everything since I entered the restaurant was a disaster. I received cold food after 45 minutes after I placed the order, that too after multiple complaints. The drinks quality was not good. It happened twice that the staff forgot the order after we placed it. They had to be reminded about the order. Overall very bad experience regarding food quality, drinks quality and service. Would not recommend to visit."
Tiki Shack,Vamsi Krishna,24 May 2019,4,"The place is really nice and they make amazing cocktails .. they are awesome .. they have really tasty starters esp their jalape√±o cheese balls ..

Don‚Äôt know if they still allow stags .. they used to let us in when it opened new at Gachibowli

Food - 5/5
Drinks - 4.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 5/5
Price - totally worth it"
Tiki Shack,Gautam Narang,24 May 2019,3,"We came at this restaurant for a drink on a weekday at it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Music was good. We ordered a Pizza, Garlic Bread and Beers. Pizza was the best I‚Äôve ever had, but Garlic Bread was disappointing. Also, we had a couple of Beers and we ordered a couple more. They were unopened, we changed our mind and asked the waiter to exchange them with Coke which was refused. I didn‚Äôt understand the waiter‚Äôs logic and I didn‚Äôt argue. Also, apart from Beer everything is costly here. I‚Äôm going for a 3 out 5 for this restaurant.
PS: This restaurant serves the best Pizza in Hyderabad."
Tiki Shack,Soumi Sur,22 May 2019,5,Lovely place to hangout with friends.. surely one of my favourite place.Ramakanth working here had always been helpful and prompt at service..keep it up!
Tiki Shack,Deepak Dhara,22 May 2019,4,"A cool place to hang out with friends. Ambience deserves a special mention as it's cool. Great music and dj and chilled out Crowd.
Food is good !"
Tiki Shack,Jasmin,21 May 2019,4,"Last night spent at Tiki Shack for a quick round of drinks. As we reached it started raining giving some respite from the heat and we could enjoy the lovely terrace ambience.

Watermelon martini for me and Bacardi for my better half with some pork spare ribs was our order. Martini was well made to my liking. The ribs had only one rib and rest were chunky pieces which we pointed out. But it was well made in spicy siracha sauce which kind of compensated.

Overall a nice place with ample seating though music is on the louder side. The only let down was the plastic cutlery which you wouldn't expect here."
Tiki Shack,Vaibhav Patil,19 May 2019,3,"Delicious food and decent crowd! Roof top was unbearable because of heat so had to shift inside. Since music was bit louder inside, bought some whiskey and went home. Overall okayshh."
Tiki Shack,Prithvikvn20,18 May 2019,2,everything about this place sound good .. with great ambiance and decent food and drink options .. I would recommend this place only if you are going as a couple or girls .. they have a huge gender discrimination for guys as they need to pay higher cover charges on weekends than the bill they would sum up .. world and tikki shack will be a better place if they stop discriminations and spread equality
Tiki Shack,Duggu,18 May 2019,4,Party !!!!!!! Great place to party and in indira nagar. They have rooftop arrangements and good space to dance and enjoy. Very decent and classy crowd. Good place to chill at weekend.
Tiki Shack,Pranshul Rathee,18 May 2019,4,A cool place to for casual hangout‚Äôs. Do not expect a crowd on weekdays but weekends it‚Äôs good. Good food good ambience. Service could a little faster but it‚Äôs fine as the music compensates it.
Tiki Shack,Anubinda Dash,18 May 2019,1,"This isn't a good place for food as there are no good options. Also, the staff doesn't feel like working when the customers are around. They need to improve."
Tiki Shack,Priya,18 May 2019,4,"The place was good, ambiance was very nice! Music was amazing!
The issue was with orders, it literally took ages get an order, after lots of struggle! I know, it was crowded and everyone was placing orders but they should also have strength to complete it as they know about the crowd...
Wash room must be repaired!"
Tiki Shack,Mr. Ego,17 May 2019,4,"The desi pub with the beach theme. They have both the indoor and outdoor seating. But they usually provide only the outdoor seating, as they keep their indoor seating mostly reserved. You might reserve and still end up sitting outside. The food was also good. The customer service is something that needs to be improved.
Top picks :
Chilly Prawns
Cheesy Fries

The chilly prawns is a must try. The mocktails were okay. Not much varieties when it comes to mocktails. Overall, a great place to hangout."
Tiki Shack,Praveen Kumar Rai,16 May 2019,2,"Ambience and location is nice. But nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group. Else entry will be denied. Thumbs down for stag. Starters are good but main course is really horrible. Very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. The staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. You can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. The complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.
You might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream. Yes, they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them. Luckily I don't like vanilla flavour so will write what I felt."
Tiki Shack,Mayank Gohri,16 May 2019,3,"Good place to go around
Ambience is good and crowd is good over weekends
Food was not that good which i thought of
Must try jalepeno cheese poppers
Ambience 4/5
Food-3/5
Seevice -3.5/5"
Tiki Shack,Kumar,15 May 2019,5,"Amazing place to hang around, nice ambience,food and amazing service ,thanks to Najibul he is a perfect host to take care of the guests,highly recommended for an memorable evening"
Tiki Shack,Prasad Kayal,12 May 2019,4,"I had visited this pub on a Saturday night with my office comrades. I must say they have a nice rooftop setup and must mention the awesome live DJ. The place is one fire üî• after 9:30, you will see a lot of guys and the place is almost packed. We had customized a packaged deal for Rs 1800 per person which includes JW Black label and Grey goose, unlimited starters and desserts towards the end. Really a good deal in terms of the offering, veg starters Panner Tikka, Manchurian and cheese Cutlet was really good. The only con was the slow service over here."
Tiki Shack,Uday Uddanti,11 May 2019,4,This is one of party hubs of Hyderabad. Initially somehow I didn't like it but after 2 or 3 visits the place grew on me. We now frequent the place for the mahol of the place. Ambience is pretty cool and nice crowd as well.
Tiki Shack,Sneha Sweetu,10 May 2019,5,Never give a 2nd thought if u hear Tiki Shack...such a fun filled place wid lovely music nd amazing starters üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç wanna visit dis place again n again..... The Dhol is the attention of all .......
Tiki Shack,Aditya SAlunkhe,08 May 2019,3,Overrated.... I don't know why stag entry is not allowed there... No crowd... Okay okay ambience..... Service is slow..... And if you are using zomato gold they will say that they don't have Kingfisher premium... Kingfisher ultra and draught beer.
Tiki Shack,Sonam Singh,07 May 2019,3,"I went on a ladies night. They have really good cocktails. Food is good, but i felt the quantity was less. Ambience and music is good . Service is good."
Tiki Shack,Mehak Oberoi,06 May 2019,5,Tiki Shack was a complete surprise package. When my colleague lead us through the shady stairs and a rumbling lift to Tiki Shack I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. But to my surprise they had a great menu and the food was amazing. The pizzas were light and tasty and all the starters were quite good. By 10pm the ambience was quite electric and we had a great time.
Tiki Shack,Sharath.gannu6,05 May 2019,4,Loved live music and dj can enloy a lot by live music ambience was good and awesome rooftop was super cool we can chill more happily by rooftop tastes are good
Tiki Shack,Manikanta Gupta Thota,04 May 2019,4,"Been here on Friday evening, staff and service was very prompt.
LIIT is very good here. Must try if you like a strong drink.
Food was not so great."
Tiki Shack,Khushboo Pandey,03 May 2019,2,"The only thing I liked about this place is there ambience, it was good other than that everything was just average or below average.
The service at this place is pathetic , we had to call the waiters several time for one small thing also .
It was a pub with no dance floor, people had to manage with whatever place they were getting
The place is known for its beach view but as we went on weekday could not see that
Food- ofcourse no one should expect anything with the food we get in pubs , it was not good here as well
Overall it was not a very good experience at this place"
Tiki Shack,Manisha Panda,01 May 2019,4,I had been with a friend on a weekday when the place was not much crowded. All we had are pizzas and drinks. The best part is you can customize your pizza. Didn't cost us a lot so would say it's reasonable. Particularly loved the ambience. We sat in the terrace area which was beautiful. The service is a little slow but we didn't mind waiting.
Tiki Shack,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,3,"Tiki shack near jubilee check post was one of my favorites and that's the graar vibe it carries, gachhibowli one is never like that but undoubtedly a good place to hang on. LIT will have a special mention in both the places though.
Little costly and ya inside they would have some restrictions with stags and couple
Your wallet would feel happy if you are going as couple or gang"
Tiki Shack,Brunda,29 April 2019,5,"Yes..... Tiki shack.. my most loving pub in the city... Been visitied this place multiple times never ever got disappointed with this place, ambiance, food and the service. Special thanks to u buddy Deepak ü§©"
Tiki Shack,Sai Venkatesh,29 April 2019,4,"Nice place, good ambience, crows is ok. Heard jubliee hills branch is better than this. But a nice place to go and hangout. Surely Recommended"
Tiki Shack,Pooja,28 April 2019,1,"Rude very rude service ..Guys here are very arrogant and worst service ever we had.
Will never ever visit again.
Had starters and cocktails, waiters are not even ready to tell the menu properly."
Tiki Shack,RINKU GOEL,28 April 2019,1,Very poor service I went in day time and took 40 min to serve nachos. Food taste very poor. I could rate this place -ve. They have speciality to server hot beer. There staff is not entertaining.
Tiki Shack,Kartik Bhardwaj,28 April 2019,4,The place is just the same as they have in Jubilee Hills. The waiting staff is humble and the ambience says the rest... a must visit if you‚Äôre in Gachibowli and need a place to chill
Tiki Shack,Prachi Pant,28 April 2019,4,"Great Ambience and music! Good service even though a crowded club.. nice rooftop as well as interiors.. had a good time.. would recommend one visit!
Chili guava martini is really chilli! No kidding!"
Tiki Shack,Abhinav Gandotra,28 April 2019,1,"Hi . Though I love the place . The service offered was pathetic to say the least.. the restaurant didn't offer the Gold privilege saying they don't offer it on weekends . Later during exit when I checked with the manager, he said there is no such thing .. but we were already billed til then . Our serving staff also asked us to pay via Google pay without bill. So please beware of these things when you are you are at the restaurant."
Tiki Shack,AKANKSHA NEGI,28 April 2019,4,"Visited this place twice and it‚Äôs completely LIT
The ambience and the crowd both will amaze you
Music is also nice and will make the non dancers groove tooüòÄ
Food is amazing and budget friendly ü§òüèª
Try to choose rooftop sitting
One of the hippie place in Hyderabad fro Fridays and Saturdays"
Tiki Shack,Chayan Jain,27 April 2019,1,Pathetic and rude staff. Slowest service. They had tables free at terrace and at lower floor but still they say that its full. So that there upper floor gets full first which is not good. Will never visit again.
Tiki Shack,Manthan Solanki,26 April 2019,4,"Nice ambience to enjoy the night
Food is not that great
But their alcohol section is decent
Service is fantastic and the waiters and staff are really kind"
Tiki Shack,Spurthy Reddy,26 April 2019,5,I visited this place with my friends.The food was very nice.Good place to hangout with friends.Its a must visit place with an open top bar in the evening hours.
Tiki Shack,Asha JS,26 April 2019,4,"This one is bigger than the Jubilee hills one and surely got good space which is a great thing as the previous one gets so cringy. We went on a ladies night but the sad part it goes only from 8 to 10 p.m. and most of the girls where not even there, anyway the starters are quite price competitive and tasty. We had veg spring rolls, veg manchurian and chicken balls. All were great and I have ordered Long Island Iced tea which they made perfect.

On Wednesdays they have a guest DJ Maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house DJ Akso is great too.

All the best guys.....keep rocking üëç

Tiki Shack,Amlan Jena,24 April 2019,5,"Looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music? Tiki Shack is the place for you. Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed. Go in with your friends on a weekend for an affordable menu and feet tapping music.
Keep up the good work Tiki Shack"
Tiki Shack,Rajat Bhatnagar,22 April 2019,4,"Good ambience and good atmosphere!
Finger food is good.
A party place basically. Open area section is very cool.
Try crispy corn or nachos here. Cocktails are above average too."
Tiki Shack,The Other Foodie,22 April 2019,4,"Visited the Gachibowli branch of Tiki Shak on a Sunday evening.
The place is very well placed in a very accessible area of Gachibowli.
It's a rooftop bar, hence the ambience was pretty amazing. They have Nicely set up indoor and outdoor seating areas.

We ordered :

Jalapeno Cheese poppers - 4/5 - Yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos.

Aloo Pakode - 3.5/5 - Pretty normal with a homely taste to it

Overall it was a good experience. The place also offers 2+2 on drinks which can also be used on mocktails ( Just in case you are not a fan of alcohol )."
Tiki Shack,Durgesh Pirtani,20 April 2019,5,Sudhanshu has been a great host.. loved his service. Will come back only coz of him.. lovely service.. good food.. loved it.. thank you so much..
Tiki Shack,Dinesh Naidu,19 April 2019,1,"Visited on 17th April Another restaurant which slips on 7% Service charge in the bill. This is over and above GST. Be careful check your bill before paying.

Irony service was really bad."
Tiki Shack,Chenreddy Raginireddy,18 April 2019,5,"I went here with my friends to celebrate my love anniversary .
this is the best place where we can chill, dance, drink.... such an amazing place really want to visit again n again...!!! only for night party lovers.......

ambiance was super cool & amazing....."
Tiki Shack,Akanksha Kaushik,14 April 2019,5,"Food is decent nothing out of the world, yet I am giving this place a 5 stars!!
Good finger food nothing you complain about, but the vibe of the place post 10pm is just electrifying!! The highlight is the desi dhol beats!! Total paisa vasool place.. They don't really have a dance floor but the vibe is so great that every inch which doesn't have a table become a dance floor! Lastly, the decor is very pretty as well!! If you want to party cheap and have a blast, this is the place for you!"
Tiki Shack,Sam,13 April 2019,1,"We visited the place on Thursday night after calling up to do the booking for 3 stag entry. We got the response over the phone that we can just walk in at 7pm. As soon as I entered the first response from a person (Nikhil) at the front desk was ""Stag not allowed"". When I showed my phone and explained that I did call to do the booking, he said no. I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience. GROW UP !!!!!"

SHIT-FIT ‚Äì So Happy Its Thursday cuz Friday Is Tomorrow..!!

While we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, I would like to share my recent experience with TiKi Shack - Rooftop Bar, Gachibowli where I have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. Such a pulsating d√©cor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

We negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.

Overall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

Kindly bare with the poor photography.

Tiki Shack,Divaydugar,08 April 2019,2,"We came for just a couple of beers, j√§ger and baileys. Ordered for 8 baileys shots first and they tasted funny for some reason and when we asked for more after clarifying About the taste, they mentioned that it‚Äôs out of stock It so happens that j√§ger, Glenfidditch is out of stock too.

Food was up to the mark."
Tiki Shack,Vibhu Sharma,07 April 2019,4,"I have been to this place twice. My first experience wasn't that great as I found the food items to be sub-par. So I quickly went to a different place. After 2 months I recently went again for an office party with ~40 people and it turned out to be a better experience. Starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, DJ was average, Biryani was good I heard but did not try it myself. Pizza was a big let down both in taste & presentation, it was served cut into small rectangular pieces. Service was decent. Staff courteous. Good interiors.
Overall - 3.5 considering the prices. Recommended for group drinking sessions, maybe a bit of dancing too."
Tiki Shack,Rajesh Smileey,06 April 2019,3,No dance floor and dj was not such good . Need to improve dj system and good players to be placed and no stock in alcohol what ever we wish to oder sorry not available.
Tiki Shack,Anamay Tamrakar (Aman),06 April 2019,4,We celebrated the a friends Bday and it was good. The DJ was average at that time which was a little mood killing. But the food and drinks are good. The Bday boy almost passed out as we gifted him the helmet pop. After which I dont think he remembers the next 24 hours!
Tiki Shack,Deepika,06 April 2019,4,"Spent an amazing Saturday night there.
Great service.
Ambience is really good.
And Food is okayish but the vibe makes up for it.
Would definitely recommend"
Tiki Shack,Pradeep,05 April 2019,2,The staff aren‚Äôt well trained they are non responsive had to wait for them to take the order even though there were only few table occupied and the food is also not worth.. the cutlery aren‚Äôt cleaned they had stains all over and felt like was at a local bar .
Tiki Shack,Siddharth Gopalam,04 April 2019,1,"I've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time. Well, what can I say, Mustang is much better-They offer everything in the menu. I never expected that I'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in HYD, but I really can't help it this time. Work this out asap."
Tiki Shack,Prachita Jayaswal,01 April 2019,5,"Love the terrace sitting area. The music and crowd is amaze and the ambience is lit. Even the non-dancers will groove here! The food quality, quantity and taste everything is good. The paneer pakora is the best ever I have tasted. French fries are crispy from outside and soft from inside, again one of the best. Chilli cheese toast was good."
Tiki Shack,Nisarga Dutta,01 April 2019,4,"Good place. Okay food. Could include budweiser in their selection of beers.
Great place to chill out with your friends. Good music as well."
Tiki Shack,Sriram Reddy,31 March 2019,4,"Great place to hangout with friends and colleagues.
Took sometime to deliver the food but worth the waiting.
Mock tails are great.
Ambiance is also perfect."
Tiki Shack,Shuvroneel Mukherjee,31 March 2019,5,"The ambience is pretty awesome and so was the awsm bbq wings. The dj sounded well but the icing was the Bhangra , such scintillating performance.
Over all a great experince with fund and food and obvio IPl."
Tiki Shack,Madhumita Paul,30 March 2019,1,"Staff behavior are very bad. Our bill was 636, they took 836. When we reached home, we got to know. No one was picking the call . Dj was veryyyy bad. I wanted to give zero star"
Tiki Shack,Bhushan,30 March 2019,1,I visited this place 2 days back with my frens hoping to have good time.. even though ambience and music was decent... the service is EXTREMELY POOR... Waiters are rude and behave as if they are doing some favor to u... manager was also not helpful... Its high high time they improve their services if they want their customers to come back to them...
Tiki Shack,Simi Reddy,30 March 2019,4,"I visited Tiki shack on a weekend afternoon and unexpectedly there was hardly any crowd. Only three tables were occupied. Then realized this place is so good but happening only in the evening. Oh BTW, those Instagram famous 'Tiki Shack roof lights' are lit only in the evening, so yes, the place, I'm sure looks much better and beautiful in the evenings.  The food served here was too good. We've ordered mostly finger food and everything we ordered tasted exceptionally good."
Tiki Shack,Anupam Jain,29 March 2019,1,Hi.. Really disappointed with the service and staff was rude and not attentive at all.. Seemed like all waiters were already high and had no clue wats going arnd them... Manager was also not very helpful.. But cant blame him with the dumb team.. u cant do much... Ambience is decent but the service is really really poor...
Tiki Shack,Kaushani Roy Choudhury,29 March 2019,5,"The most beautiful restaurant I have visited till now in Gachibowli, Hyderabad.
Very friendly and courteous staff.
Service was on point.
Food was tasted amazing.
Had fun playing darts with the staff as well.
Absolutely delighted with this place.
No complaints at all, would highly recommend you to visit."
Tiki Shack,Aniruddha Patil,28 March 2019,1,Stag entry not allowed on a Thursday night. Extremely disappointed. It was a birthday of a friend and a group of 9. We said that we will confine ourselves to a secluded corner but were denied.
Tiki Shack,Chilugurishanthireddy,27 March 2019,5,Great place to hangout with friends. Been here for a party. Music was classy and ambience was more classy. Just hit the place and get sloshed
Tiki Shack,VIN,21 March 2019,1,They have different menu than mentioned in Zomato. They say menu is different on weekends and weekdays. Else place is ok to visit once. They ask for identity proof for entry.
Tiki Shack,Komal Jain,17 March 2019,3,"My friends and I went here on a Friday night around 8:30 and the place was pretty full and had good music interesting interiors  and overall great vibe.
The service was a little slow, but quite understandable given the crowd that kept pouring in till late in the night

Food that we ordered - 
1. MASALA PEEENAT  - your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices. Decent munching

2. MASALA LIJJAT - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

6.  FRIES - good old classic salted fries! :)

The DJ played some really great songs! 
Had a great time, especially when they played the Bollywood music and most people were on their feet!"
Tiki Shack,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,4,"Food is good, especially the taste, but range is limited for main course. They have a good dance area though not marked out and hinders the movement. Outside seating is decent and service is better."
Tiki Shack,Manoj Gangwar,15 March 2019,1,"I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends
We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

Many thanks for spoiling our Friday night"
Tiki Shack,Aditya Reddy,15 March 2019,5,Tiki is well known place for its best drinks and friendly staff u will always love the food here and the ambiance is just simple it‚Äôs a beach look.... located at very right place easy to identify great week endssssssss........

Tiki Shack,Ramana,15 March 2019,5,"An awesome place to hang around with friends and family.. we love this place and it's the place to land in the week end.. not heavy on the pocket at all....
We just love this place"
Tiki Shack,Rahulinder Singh,15 March 2019,1,"Very bad behaviour of the staff, no one took the order for 45 minutes, when we asked the staff they were pointing at each other saying he will take order. When we called the manager he was unnecessarily defending the staff saying they thought that table is for 4 other people must be joining. Sheer waste of time."
Tiki Shack,Priyanka Paul,13 March 2019,5,Nice place for party. Good ambiance. Outside sitting is nice. We went on wednesday for ladies night and had a great time. Tasty food.Friendly staff and great service.
Tiki Shack,Sourav,12 March 2019,3,"The quality of food and drink was really good. What turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. A few of the waiters are really ignorant. They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined. So my humble request is, if you don't like to serve a smaller group, mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant."
Tiki Shack,Madhubanti Dasgupta,11 March 2019,5,Loved the service as well as the food. Especially the chicken salt and pepper. Loved it so much that i took 2 portions home as parcel. The staff is also friendly. Must visit place.
Tiki Shack,Neha Singh,10 March 2019,3,"Amazing indoor and outdoor place to chill. Music is amazing... go for safe choice of food selection, which you are aware of... I visit here all the time for music! Cool crowd. Gotta improve over food and cocktails! Drinks otherwise is good (options)! Two stars less coz they gotta improve over food!"
Tiki Shack,Amith Varma Sagiraju,07 March 2019,4,Good place to hangout with Friends. Stags are not allowed mainly on Weekends. Prices are comfortable and music is üî•. Food is very good. Service is very good and staff are polite.

Tiki Shack,Foodie On Wheels...,02 March 2019,5,"We tried many items here. All items were good In taste and they had good dance floor action even on Sunday night.

We tried nachos, fries, pasta and pizza. Everything was perfect.

LIIT was also very good."
Tiki Shack,Sonu Tomar,28 February 2019,5,"Nice ambience, I loved it. Service was also quick, Free photography by Bunny's photography made the night memorable. Bollywood songs after 10 really good."
Tiki Shack,Hareesh Sasanapuri,27 February 2019,5,Ambience is good and also starters . Good place to hangout with friends and had nice fun time in spending more time . Thanks for the management to the service and maintaining it on track . Bit Smoked non-veg items should be cooked better .
Tiki Shack,Avin Seth,27 February 2019,3,"Not that much great place, reason being the service is very slow. No one comes to take the order. Located in a great business area with all the big companies. The place has energy and good vibe but service is something that needs to be worked on. They have started serving different vapes at this place which costs around 700-800/-. Thats something cool you get in different flavours. Food is fine.

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Tiki Shack,Raja Srivathsav,27 February 2019,4,"This place is lit! üî•
If you‚Äôre a person who would start off your clubbing night with some pop, electronic music and end it with proper punjabi dhol then this is the place for you.
AMazing Dj! He knew when to get the crowd exited.
I‚Äôve tried their Long Island iced tea and Johnny Walker.
LIT was amazing.. one of the best I‚Äôve had in the city.
Their chilly prawns was also yummy (not spicy enough for a Hyderabadi though)
Also, you get to try vape here! (Try their blueberry flavour, it‚Äôs dope)

Ambience: 3.5
Service: 4
Music: 3"
Tiki Shack,Aishwarya Gupta,24 February 2019,5,Tiki shack is a cool place to hang out with friends. It has an open rooftop space plus an inside hall. The ambience is chill. Drinks are really good. We tried different virgin mojitos. Food is also fair. Mostly snacks (chakhna) üòâ
Tiki Shack,Deepak Arora,22 February 2019,4,The ambiance was very nice. It was my first time at this restaurant and it was a good experience overall. We ordered chilly chicken and veg Manchurian and both were upto the expectations for the taste.
Tiki Shack,Mohan Kr,21 February 2019,5,"Lovely place, a delight everytime i walkin. Been here quite some times and they never disappoint. Great starters and amazing pizza. Not many on the menu to chose from but they put up what they make the best and live up to it. Could add a little chinese main course on the menu but thats ok. Try the variety of drinks they serve and groove to their lovely choice of music. Enough eye candy for the guys and a fab ladies night for the girls. That day when you crack a head at office walkin here for some peace. Tiki time!"
Tiki Shack,Vinay Yadav,19 February 2019,5,"Good food, great staff-ask for lama(darjeeling), Alcohol prices-decent.
Ambience-one of the best in city
Gachibowli outlet is way better than the jubilee hills one.
DJ 10 on 10
Must visit if you're a partyholic.."
Tiki Shack,Sneha Battula,18 February 2019,3,"Visited this place on a Saturday evening cause I've heard a lot about Tiki Shack. The ambience was pretty decent and has a beautiful roof top view. But, I was honestly surprised that the food wasn't that great and infact I thought it was bad enough for all that I've heard from people.

Ordered non veg nachos and I hardly found any non veg in it. The pizza was quite bland too. One of the really bad pepporoni pizza I've had in my life.

Food: 3/5. (3 cause of service and the nice people there)"
Tiki Shack,Vikrant Nakhate,17 February 2019,4,"Greetings. The place is very ambient. Roof-top gives you a very good view. Baskets are hung here as well to add to the ceiling beauty! Pocket friendly prices. Staff is helpful and courteous. They play good Bollywood music preferably Punjabi 10:30 PM onwards with a ‚ÄòDholwala‚Äô playing Dhol to dance on the beats.
Do carry your ID cards with a visible photo, mindfully!"
Tiki Shack,Nikhil Raj Tatikonda,17 February 2019,1,"I could rate below one..where I didn't satisfy on billing part..I didn't know how they are collecting customer money , for me it's very disheartening on bill amount they are taking 7% optional service charges..my bill amount was around 2k means 126..they are removed when I was asked to them..it's not fair ..it's another type of integrity in business ."
Tiki Shack,Rahul Gupta,16 February 2019,3,"Ambience - 4
Music - 4 
Staff - 3 
Drinks - 3 
Food - 4
Hit on wallet - medium
A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

Cheers!"
Tiki Shack,Madhava,15 February 2019,5,Best pub in Gachibowli. Budget friendly. U can get good experience here. Visited many times and never got disappointed. Their snacks menu is also so different. Courteous staff. Nice dj.
Tiki Shack,Aruna Swetapadma,14 February 2019,4,"If you love to get lost in music and enjoy a real good ambience, then my friend Tiki Shack is your place. Staff is quite food. I used my Zomato Gold membership there and enjoyed 2+2 on drinks. Food was delicious too. I would love to spend more such evenings there."
Tiki Shack,Shubham Dubey,13 February 2019,2,"Service was too slow. Waiters took some 20 minutes to realise we wanted to place an order.
Music was excessively loud, and reached a point where the speakers couldn't support the playback without distorting the music.
However the quality of LIIT was brilliant.
I didn't like food either"
Tiki Shack,HungerDaddy,08 February 2019,4,"Tiki Shak, Gachibowli - Hyderabad

The Gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

The place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

The best time to go here is on Friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a DJ, live entertainment and wifi. So,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

Among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to Desi and angrezi whiskey. If you want to try something different after work, then do try their Helmet pop (for INR 980 - which is an experience in itself). This involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

For food, try their Chilli Cheese Toast, finger chips, Chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. The prices are really pocket friendly.

Tiki Shack,Monica Tetali,06 February 2019,3,"Been to this place few days back with my friends

Ambience was quite good -4/5

Service was okay -3.5/5

Food was average - 3.5/5

We had ordered 3 non veg starters and 3 veg starters. There weren‚Äôt many good options for veg starters and something veg that we ordered were just average at taste. And moreover that day there were only starters and main course was not available. When it comes to music this was the best part. The day we visited there was bhangra music. Apart form Bhangra the dj was good was playing mostly bollywood music. Overall if you want good bollywood music with not so great food you can surely try this place"
Tiki Shack,Neha Patial,03 February 2019,5,Awsm place to hangout..beautiful ambiance and food is really good.you get to see both the terrace top and roof on the top.the service is quick and a secured place with good security.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Uma Shankar,23 May 2019,4,"Ambience is bit cozy, music is too loud. The food is good and service is little slow but it's okay. It need some modifications in ambience then sure it will be great place to hangout"

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Nakul.dhand420,20 May 2019,1,"I went to the restaurant on friday night and have booked the table in the morning itself. But manager denied and said i am giving you a favour for the table. We had drinks but food was pathetic and one dish was replaced when the bill was paid and we have to leave it. Coming to the bill, these guys have started charging some service charge (which is illegal) which will be forced on customers and they expect the customers to pay service charge in cash .I am reporting this to local authorities as they have started booking other restaurants for these illegal things."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Sai Jagadeesh Battini,17 May 2019,1,Worst food order Chilly corn and they gave us Pakoda. Bad quality food ever better they suppose need to change the name to Worst food we provide and
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Asha Tejaswini,17 May 2019,5,This place never disappoints me.Food and ambiance are perfect.They have both outdoor and indoor seating with good music.Must try: Chilli prawns
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Amith Katta,17 May 2019,4,Very cool open roof Restaurant that served great appetizers and booze. Good place to hangout with friends and located in the centre of Hyderabad's IT industries.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Td Dt,13 May 2019,1,"First they had some kind of rule like below 21yrs old( I really respect that check) so he asked for IDs at the entrance we dint carry that but we had our soft copies so we showed that.However one among 6of us wasn't having the soft copy we tried ensuring that our friend was 30yrs old but he dint believe and after lot many arguments finally we were allowed to enter.... People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Aman Kejriwal,11 May 2019,3,"This place closes by 12 and the food is is quantity but it closes earlier then expected, what should be done in this case. It shares wrong information."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Aditya SAlunkhe,08 May 2019,4,"Good ambience.......

Good place to chill with friends..."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Chenreddy Raginireddy,08 May 2019,3,"I went here to celebrate my birthday.....
If you go to Mustang, you should sit on the terrace otherwise it isn't worth it.

The place has good service too, the servers are helpful."

Service is good. Recommend Definitely."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Abhinav Kulshrestha,05 May 2019,4,"Good ambience both sitting in or in open terrace. Food is okaish, as it doesn't justify the cost of items but some items tastes good.

Place is a complete ‚Äúno no‚Äù who prefers good customer service."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Nithinesh Bodhanapu,05 May 2019,1,Worst place to hang out. Pathetic customer service. The place is money minded and the waiters there dont care for customers at all. Not a good place to hang out.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Gvr Varun,05 May 2019,1,"Pathetic management, this worst experience ..would curse manager  ,found rats walking around ,found food to be Stinking,liquor was smelling like pee,glasses weren't washed properly !!hate to visit back again ,

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Bharathi,04 May 2019,1,The people here are not at all polite. I will never be here again. I don't suggest this place at all. Had a worst experience today. Waste of time.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Subha Mahapatra,04 May 2019,1,Wish to witness the worst customer service? Please do visit this place. You'll be amazed to see that such a famous bar could have such pathetic people. There is this manager who has no idea how to speak to people. If I had the option to give it a negative rating I would!! Not recommended.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Sogathur Balaji,04 May 2019,1,"The place was good and the ambience felt nice until a few friends and I went out for a smoke and wanted to sit at the lounge just for a smoke, whole the so called ""supervisor"" came along and asked us to leave because the seats were reserved, we were ready to leave but we asked what the issue was and instead of talking politely he just started being rude and asked us to leave the place. When we said we wanted to speak to his supervisor he said he was the owner of the place! The people who work here have no concept of good customer service or politeness."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Brijesh Mohanty,04 May 2019,1,"One of the most pathetic places when it comes to customer service, bad food , and the attitude of the employees are absolutely annoying especially the owner. He would make you feel as if you he is is doing a favor , you won't want to give them your money"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shashank,04 May 2019,1,The Owner is absolutly pathetic and has no idea about customer service. Pathetic food and bad customer service make the whole place nothing but a horrible place..

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,5,"Never thought the place is that lit. Purely under rated. Staff is super friendly and they won't have nonsense rules for stags too. Very much happening too. Good ambiance with nice terrace.
Need to be little early for draught.
Great value for money"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Nandita Agarwal,28 April 2019,4,"If you go to Mustang, you should sit on the terrace otherwise it isn't worth it.
The place has good service too, the servers are helpful.
Mustang has zomato gold so that's an added incentive to go.
We ordered nachos which was a big disappointment because either they were not baked properly or they were old they tasted weird.
Fir veg pizzas their options aren't that great. So we ended up orsering the Greek pizza twice but dint regret it even a bit. The Greek pizza is the safest and the best bet in their menu."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Himika Saha,27 April 2019,3,This pub is located at the heart of the hi-tech city. It's a rooftop bar with a pleasant view. Nothing very extraordinary about the place. Food is about average. Mostly the office crowd keeps pouring in. Live streams the ipl match in big screen. It mostly remains crowded and yes the music is bollywood
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Siddhanta Dey,27 April 2019,5,Been there on a Friday night and loved the ambience. Place was not too much crowded . Music and DJ was good and also the food. This place is situated in a good location convenient for people working in Gachibowli. We ordered LIIT and it was amazing. Must visit.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Chaitanya Bhagwat,25 April 2019,3,"Great selection of drinks, but most of the options on the menu were not actually available, which was a bit disappointing. The limited options that were available including pizzas and burritos were very good."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Sushant Negi,24 April 2019,4,"Such a nice place at Gachibowli, hang out with friends and as a couple . Also enjoyed the dance floor with good music. Food was okies type but has a lot of options. Ambience is also good."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,DS Singal,24 April 2019,4,"An wxtra star for dance floor. Waahaaaa whatta a night it was. A great dance floor and friendly dj. It was a night i can‚Äôt forget food yum manchurian, noodles, pasta, pizza were great. Would nt mind going again."

Mustang Terrace Lounge,InLoveWithFood,19 April 2019,1,Definitely will not go again. Had gone with my friends for lunch and the waiters were shabby and drunk at service. We couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of the place.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Chayan,18 April 2019,2,"This place has quite a ambience to visit for üíØ
But that's all you'll get at this place.
They have just two attendant in total to take your order and service time is very poor, I almost forgot I ordered something.
The taste is not worth the wait and the DJ makes it even more worse by his songs!

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Ashima Saxena,16 April 2019,1,"On my visit at a pleasant evening to the restaurant I ordered Cosmopolitan drink. While my friends beer came right away, they took almost an hour to get my drink. After that day, I got some infection in my throat which I ignored for few days and it got worse. The doctor at Apollo told me that it‚Äôs a severe bacterial infection and I had to take antibiotic injection twice along with other medication followed by various tests. Although everything about the restaurant was nice but not sure what went wrong with that drink in particular which ended me in a hospital!"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Hitesh Dutt,15 April 2019,1,"Well going Step by Step:

Ambience is pretty good 4* for that.
Location is accessible 3* for that.
Service is okay too 3* for that.
Food was okay, not something out of the blue. But yes it was reasonable so 3* for that too.

Overall 1* for poor post order served service. I had asked for leman about 7 times before i reached out to manager for lemons.

Same drill happened twice on same day while being on same table.

Recommended for drinks and ambiance but heyy do not rely in their service."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Surya Cena,15 April 2019,4,"Located in one of the prime locations of hyderabad, Mustang terrace lounge has an American Cowboy theme with some really good ambience providing both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has an amazing view of the city especially at night time.
Food is average to be honest. The french fries and nachos items could have been way better. Chicken tikka pizza was pretty bland. Chilli fish was really good though.
My friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say, both of them were amazing. I had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better. Definitely worth a try.
The place has zomto gold on drinks which is great for people who‚Äôd like to drink. Overall it was a pretty good experience at this place with some decent food and the ipl screening."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Polimati Naveen Prasad,15 April 2019,4,"I went to this place for Dinner!
I like the Roof top view it had and the ambience was good. I orderd for couple of shots with Cosmopolitan cocktail and a Potato fry with garlic, curry leaves and chilly flakes fried in olive oil and it was yummy served with maiones dip.
I somehow felt that the service needs to be improved and here is my overall rating out of 5
Ambience 4.2
Cocktail 3.8
Food 4
Service 3"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Prachita Jayaswal,14 April 2019,3,"Food, drinks and music all is good. What this place lacks is in service. The servers literally forgot us and we had to call them multiple times and remind them to take our orders. The ambience is great. The view is superb. They have 3 sitting areas, indoor and two terrace sitting."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,FitFoodFad,14 April 2019,4,"One of the better and smaller roof top places in Hyderabad. It would hardly have about 8 tables on the rooftop which makes me like this place. It's quite, cosy and they play some good music. There are also 2 exclusive places on the rooftop, one which is like one tiny table on an elevation and another like an enclosed area.

We asked for cheese balls, fish tava, chicken 65 and margarita pizza. All these items were good, nothing exceptional but just about right. Recommend- Yes, Must visit- maybe not"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratichi Mohanty,12 April 2019,1,"Horrible service, food is below average. Staff is extremely rude including the manager. Ambience is the only good thing. If i had an option i would have given a negative star rating. This place just spoilt my Friday night mood."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Kaushani Roy Choudhury,10 April 2019,4,"Already been to this place twice, absolutely love the rooftop and the food. It's really windy up there and has a great ambiance, would highly recommend for a date or for hanging out with friends.
The only problem is the service is pretty slow which is probably because there isn't enough staff.
Otherwise no complaints at all."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shambo Banerjee,08 April 2019,1,It's one of the worst places to be in during the week. The Manager is extremely unfriendly and rude. The music sucks and the food and service is worth abhorrence..
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Harshita Khandelwal,06 April 2019,1,"Pathetic plac, I would never suggest anyone to go here.
Poor service and the waiters have literally no manners at all.
Overall a very bad experience"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Ashwani Kumar,03 April 2019,5,Amazing ambience with amazing spicy chicken table and chicken 65 which is must try.Amazing food with amazing ambience.Really enjoyed a lot with friends and company

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Akhila Akhi,31 March 2019,5,"Trust it will surely make your innerself more happy. One of the best roof top lounges with such a pleasant ambience, good food and quick service. Nd only complaint is there was no music. They said they have a problem with the socket. But still it's okay. I'll surely visit again"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Kalinga Sarangi,31 March 2019,1,"Worst service and behaviour is extremely rude and unprofessional by d staffs as well as manager.
Manager is short tempered and unsocial. I ll never suggest for this pub."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Aman,30 March 2019,3,"Great ambience. It is very windy when you sit at the top most table and it has great view. Service is average and food is also average. Went there on friday in a group of 10 people. We ordered many dishes but the quality was average. Since we were sitting at the top service was also average.
Ambience 4/5
Food - 2.5/5
Service 3/5
Overall 3/5"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Vaishu Pemmaraju,30 March 2019,4,We've been to this place as an office team outing in the afternoon. They let us play DJ for ourselves though it was afternoon. We had lots of fun and had a great time. The place was very nice and food as well. Thanks!
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Arijit Mondal,29 March 2019,3,"The ambience is good but please check the bill before paying. They charge 10% service charge without asking you which is illegal. Please do not pay service charge, ask them to remove it if you find it on the bill. Thanks."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Mimi,26 March 2019,3,"The place I have visited many times made me sad by the last visit. Because most of the tables they kept on reserved, though during staying there till 10.30pm, we have not seen anyone to come and occupy the seats. The starters items are extremely costly and very less in quantity. Only reason of visiting the place is roof top. Otherwise it is one of the most expensive places to visit in Gachibowli area."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pruthvi Manyam,24 March 2019,5,"These guys are Awesome, Balram, Diven and Jagan. Thanks for the hospitality guys. Keep up your good job. All the cocktails were good.. specially the in-house ones. Thanks !!"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Abhimanyu Padmaraj,24 March 2019,4,One of the best roof tops around and is pocket friendly with delicious food. Their service is good. They got good music going. They have wide variety of cocktails and mocktails to choose. A nice place to hangout in the evening with your friends and loved ones.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Anand Hari,23 March 2019,1,"This is worst place in gachibowli, let me tell you wat happened as soon as we came in bar worker suggested to sit near corner its was kind washroom near. When whole bar was empty on Friday night, as I gave full mouth full to bar workers as insulted guests by asking them sit in corner as if we are cheap. I gave him wat he deserves. I sincerely suggest ppl not to go."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Jay Tripathy,19 March 2019,4,"I liked the ambience, however i feel there is a scope for improvement in the drink selection and food. The taste for authentic Indian cuisine is maintained"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shalu Singh,17 March 2019,5,"A classic place in gachibowli. Ambience, food, drinks everything is up to the mark. If you want to have some chill time with friends, just opt for this one. Being a vegetarian, i could find the good starters over there."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Sudheer,16 March 2019,5,The best place for food guys I have tried so many food items here trust me you will enjoy the food here and the ambience give you a vintage look all over you will enjoy the place and evenings the Bollywood dj night will make you to step on the dance floor and make some moves.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Meghna M√´no√±,16 March 2019,5,"Went to this place on a Friday evening and Trust me I was pleasantly surprised. Was the first time I was visiting with a group of 7 and we had made reservations and as we entered they politely showed us our seats and it looked luxurious AF. The Food was brought fast and it tasted really good!
We ordered Cheese balls, Chicken Wings, Chicken Manchurian, Chilli Paneer and BBQ pizza! The pizza wasn't great but everything else was delicious!
The staff is friendly and though they were a little confused with our order for 'flavoured shots' they were very patient and bought us exactly what we are desired for and treated us really well üíì
I'm going to have to tell you that we are definitely putting Mustang Lounge into our book mark places and will be visiting soonüëèüèª"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Hari Krishna,15 March 2019,1,Very bad... Management is worst than whatever I visited till now. Since I was giving 1 start he started scolding me and threatening me. I am totally disappointed.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Deepak Deepu,15 March 2019,4,"Nice place to visit at evenings, visited a long time ago friendly staff and the food was great. If you want to spend some peaceful time with your loved once, give a try"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Akansha Salampuria,14 March 2019,5,"Best rooftop place in Hyderabad.
Dj was playing best songs, playing with the people
Nice place to enjoy your weekend.
Overall I am happy with the service and place.
Would recommend this to all my friends"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Venkat.Ch,13 March 2019,3,"Yes... Mustang is a great lounge..just went in the late evening... Just want to kill some time there that all.. Used zomato gold.. They do accept it.. Well and they dont have Fosters and Kf Premium are not available we order KF ultra and a while later he bought Budweiser.. As the idea is to kill time so we just had the beer what we've they given.

Service : 3
Rest all u can mark as 4."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Santosh Kumar,12 March 2019,5,"Best place in the town. Visited this place with my colleagues last weekend. Apt service heart food make this place a memorable.
Will visit again soon."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Prashant Bahuguna,11 March 2019,4,"Been here two times, once at the rooftop and once inside. Both of times it was fun, service was quick and staff was courteous, full points for that. Dance floor is amazing, always gets everyone dancing with their jam. Only thing lacking is the food department, need to work on that a bit. But overall a nice experience and recommend."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Amith Varma Sagiraju,07 March 2019,3,Decent place. Food is good. Music is average. Staff are polite and service is good. Not an pub compared to the term pub. No dedicated dance floor.
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Vivek,05 March 2019,4,"In Gachibowli this place is nice to have drinks and dance. Zomato gold offer makes this experince even better. 
All the items were good could have been better, service was good. 
Overall 4/5 rating."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Gourmetlove,05 March 2019,3,"Went on a Friday evening just because I was in the Gachibowli side. Tried the cheese balls and the bell pepper onion pizza. The food was decent, did not have any drinks, so can't comment on that and the ambience was okay. But service is what made me really frustrated with the place. Hence the three star."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Ankit Jain,02 March 2019,1,"Really bad experience.
For the first time I heard we do not provide glasses to serve water.

Even worse, for the first the I heard that we serve quarter plate/dinner plate only once on a table and even if it gets spoiled they won't change.

And worst of all, when you try to talk to manager he is not even interested and asks us to leave the table if we are not liking the experience.

Would not like to recommend any of my friends to visit the place."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Prem Kalyan,01 March 2019,1,The place refused to replace quarter plate. The service is pathetic. Food is on table but no spoons or forks. The manager has one answer they are playing by rule book
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shravan Punna,01 March 2019,4,"It's a good place with awesome ambience and a wide variety of dishes to choose from. We booked a terrace lounge for our team out and have spent good time. The staff are courteous and the service is faster than expected. Would love to go again here. Pros: Ambience, Food, Alcohol, Service."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Santosh Jena,19 February 2019,4,"Though it was my 4th time visit to this place, but honestly I enjoyed much on weekday party rather than on weekends. Me and my friend are throwing a party for our colleagues. I observed On weekends it‚Äôs always overcrowded here and won‚Äôt get seats for group 5 ppl or above, may be due to dance floor.

This time we got a nice staff, who served us very well with his prompt services. Apart from our drinks, we enjoyed Rawa fish sticks and delicious pizzas here.

Ambience- 4
Food- 3.5
Staff & Services - 5
Overall - 4"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Satyaranjan Sahoo,18 February 2019,5,"Rooftop bar with perfect ambience for a peaceful time. You'll definitely like the view from the top.

Food was decent with satisfactory service. Music was loud enough to set your mood. They do have a small dance floor. Perfect tiny place!!! Definitely worthy of frequent visits üòäüòâ."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Koundinya Bhogaraju,16 February 2019,5,"Awesome rooftop place to hangout. Dance floor and dj are cool. Service is ‚ÄúTHE BEST‚Äù. The way they welcome you, take care of your order is just extraordinary. Yes, I am a regular here and almost made friends ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you are looking for a crazy dance party, you can have an inside table and if you are on a date rooftop is your place. The location attracts the best crowd in the town. Visit on a Saturday and thank me later üëçüèº"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,ManInGreen,14 February 2019,4,"Been here twice. I just love the ambience here.
Open roof top view at nights is something one shouldn't miss.
Service could be better. (Probably because we went on a Friday night. Happening place it is.)
Food too wasn't top notch.
They do have a dance floor. (But not big enough)
Overall it's a fun place to hangout with friends."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratheek Denny Padinjarathala,13 February 2019,3,"With an impressive location, it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative. The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room. The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base. 

The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere.

The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain.

It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratipurna Panda,13 February 2019,4,"Boy oh boy , the prepossessing set up of rooftop.. the ambience. The beautiful music.. the feeling.. yes, the feeling we got, in this place ..!!

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'üò£, but there was 'chanchal hawa' üò¨

Too dramatic??- I know ü§£
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. üòú Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside üò≠. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

MESSAGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT: please have at least one staff in the restrooms, till you shut down, to avoid these kind of issues. Plzzzz.. üò•"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Varunkumar Reddy,11 February 2019,4,"Good place to hangout and chill, the terrace seating is also good, ambiance is ok, we booked a table via @dineout_india, rather than drinks, the food is good here
And in frame1 The spicy chicken table-- which was not that spicy but it tastes excellent, and the pizza we ordered was chicken keema pizza-- which also good with thin crest, cheese was also good Mustang Terrace Lounge
The only disappointment is drinks"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Narender Chand,09 February 2019,5,"Awesome Ambience, cheap beers and you can get Kingfisher drought tower in rs 750, ,food is also up to the mark.
Beet part, they allows stack on weekend s."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Manzar Jabbar Khan,09 February 2019,1,"Waste of time and money.
Starters served cold, main course was just on margin, very poor service, i repeate very poor service, too much of time taken by them to arrive at your place."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Akanksha Sengupta,07 February 2019,4,"MUSTANG TERRACE LOUNGE
This restaurant and bar is perfect for casual dine in on weekdays and best for Friday night, they have a cozy interior seating and the outside seating gives the best view of the city, the menu includes the best snacks to have with drinks such as Malai kebabs, Tawa machhi, Dahi kebabs, stuffed mushroom and many more.
The restaurant has a wide variety of Mexican and Italian cuisine dishes such as enchiladas, quesadillas, burgers, pizzas and pastas.

This is a must visit rooftop place in Hyderabad."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shashi Saini,07 February 2019,1,"I happen to visit Mustang Yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place.

The service there is pathetic. You order any thing ( even a beer ) it takes them 20-25 min.

Even after repeatedly telling them, looked like they were drunk or deaf. Considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the Veg and Non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the Roti's to come.

The manager PAVAN, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. He had just one answer Sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.

One Star that too just of the Ambiance and Roof Top."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Yashwanth Varakala,05 February 2019,4,Loved the place it's very attractive. It has the best view from top. Service is good and enjoyed the tasty food as they customized in the way I want. Minor drawback found with the parking
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Andrew Kithan,04 February 2019,1,"Overpriced menu. If you find the food appetizing here, you must really have a bad taste. The Thai chicken curry I ordered is just an another name for South Indian chicken curry."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Anuja Alkunte,03 February 2019,4,"This place has nice ambience. Good to hangout with friends.
They play really good music. All decent crowd.

Loud music and dance floor , what else can we expect. Pavan took a great care of us with his pleasent hospitality. We had a Rocking party"
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Mohit,30 January 2019,4,"What can I say about this place. I used to stay in Gachibowli and used to visit the place often. It's a happening place during weekends, not so much during weekdays, but I have never seen it overcrowded (which is why I love it so much). One negative I would say is that the price are a bit higher than their competition."
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Vinay Vicky,30 January 2019,5,"Nice place !! And super experience!!

Food ### 5/5....... Have been here a number of times and the food was always good. Specially love the pizzas , Chinese starters and chef special here!

"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Bala Krishna,11 May 2019,2,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place
Never again"
"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Sunil Beura,11 May 2019,2,"I went in team dinner there on 10th may .the worst part is they don‚Äôt have anything in main course except veg/non-veg biryani .
Even for staters also they hv very less choice
They don‚Äôt have grill on the table .
Only the staff behaviour was polite
Apart from this it‚Äôs not a standard restaurant at all ."

Behrouz Biryani,Fatima,25 May 2019,2,"First the price is too high and the quantity I'm getting is lower than the expectation . You can see the cup it's so small like its just gave me for only to taste it. And about the taste it's good. I like it. And I also got a small bread with this,like who eats bread with a 'Daleem'.
I would not recommend you to eat but If you just want to have a bite of taste then go ahead. :)"
Behrouz Biryani,Mithun Abe Mohan,18 May 2019,2,"I ordered the biryani with great expectations. The packaging, and the presentation is extremely nice, and the aroma was great. The biryani thigh, was frozen in the middle! It's a prepackaged frozen food reheated at the time of ordering. That is not the expectation, at least in Hyderabad!
The fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me"
Behrouz Biryani,Nilofar Sanade,21 April 2019,5,"Ok so this is the second time m ordering from here...and the taste is same as I felt for first time.... really good experience üëçüòäThe Biryani comes in very stunning package...it looks good as soon as u open it with almonds on top of it.It comes with raita and gulab jamun tooüòç Talking about Biryani it's not too spicy which I like...
Packaging-10/10
Taste 9/10
Must Try‚úåÔ∏è"
Behrouz Biryani,S G K,19 April 2019,5,The Behrouz Biryani is the Royal Biryani. The flavour of Rice is super and the pieces of chicken are yummy. The presentation of Biryani is with fried onions and Badam ( Almond ) . Served with Mint Raitha and Gulab Jamun.
Behrouz Biryani,MirzaFasahath AliBaig,16 April 2019,1,"I never received this order 21812387 today. No one contacted me. I asked Zomato chat rep to have someone contact me regarding this issue. Please call me after 3 PM IST.  I have registered my compliant on twitter handle, how can you mentioned without verifying with me that it was delivered ? No follow up done from Behrouz. Very disappointing. Please refund my amount. See the rider is still on the way (pic)"
Behrouz Biryani,Shyamu,24 March 2019,1,"One of the worst biriyanis i ate . Home deliverd thru zomato . Very worse . I wud like to cook my self though tired than ordering in behrouse.one of the worst biryani i ever had. One has to pay for packaging only. Big packaging and less quantity. One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad

Note 
increase the quality food then no matter what the price is ."
Behrouz Biryani,Govind,20 March 2019,3,"So much hype for a sub par biryani. Ordered paneer biryani, taste did not live upto the hype. The taste was bland, could have been better. Any local biryani place has much better biryani at a lower price."
Behrouz Biryani,Parimal Khatri,12 March 2019,4,"I've order for home delivery. The service was quick and Hassle Free.

Ordered veg biryani from the restaurant as suddenly I was craving for veg. I was so impressed by the packing & also they give raita & gulab jamun with it.

The biryani was properly packed. And was warm enough to eat too. It had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani don't. It's really different. And its very tasty.
One can definitely try their veg biryani.

( All vegetarians & biryani lovers this is for you)

Do try it out."
Behrouz Biryani,Krakeshkumar713,10 March 2019,1,Absolutely not the taste we indians love. We would want food to be spicy and recipes at Behrouz and co. aren't the way we expect. Not the best choice
Behrouz Biryani,Anusha Punjala,06 March 2019,4,"Behrouz never disappoints, As always amazing packaging and amazing biryani. I love the fact that they send the gulab jamun and yummy raita. I wish they also include a Saalan with it.Ive tried their Murgh Mahakani Biryani which is as usual very flavourful and spicy. 
Disclaimer: Have it when it's hot and fresh.

Behrouz Biryani,Vamsy Sivaarcca,06 March 2019,1,"I was promised to get a refund for an order that has not been delivered. They first told me that i would get my money in 24 hours, then changed it to 24 working hours, now they are not answering the phone. Bloody cheaters."
Behrouz Biryani,Rijithka,01 March 2019,1,Ordered for Zakheedar Paneer and got chicken biriyani with the label of veg. This is not acceptable at all. This is not the first time this is happening with Behrouz
Behrouz Biryani,Azhar Syed,01 March 2019,1,Worst biryani. Shahghouse biryani is 100 times better than this biryani. Very Very less quantity. Price is very high.Worst biryani.

Awe some food delivery.. with this biryani they are serving desert was Soo sweet n nice n also Raitha they are served chilled with cutlery they are served with somp it is tasty"
Behrouz Biryani,Abdul Rehman,16 February 2019,5,I am big a fan of these place. They have one of the best biryanis. I frequently order from here and till now they have never let me down. You should give it a try and taste afghani style biryani.
Behrouz Biryani,Karna Nair,15 February 2019,3,Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today.Wanted to have it since ages.So today when the package came I was really thrilled.The biriyani comes in a stunning package.And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells.The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top.The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too.The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad.This one is extremely sutle in taste.The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily. The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked.Overall the biriyani was a really good experience.But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way.
Behrouz Biryani,Bhavya Vennampalli,14 February 2019,1,Bad service I have not received the order but I got a mail that you have enjoyed the meal. Irritating service from zomato . Not support team and pick up delivery boy called for delivery
Behrouz Biryani,Jai Gowttham,11 February 2019,5,"I just love their packing. It looks so royal and classy and has the premium feel. Their biryani makes you feel that you are having the traditional royal Hyderabadi biryani and the smell from it will make your mood. Great stuff. Keep it up, guys!"
Behrouz Biryani,Anisha.thakur02,10 February 2019,1,Very less quantity and the food was packed in cartoon book very unhappy
Behrouz Biryani,Sneh Tarang Randev,09 February 2019,3,"The biryani experience started well. Having said that, it's not as good as earlier experience now. Two simple issues: chicken biryani has no chicken and dry fruits have disappeared. Should bring them back?"
Behrouz Biryani,Ankija Agarwal Deorah,02 February 2019,5,I have ordered the veg falafal biryani irrespective of the ratings given..But to surprise it came out so tasty...From the first bite to the last rice in your plate u will get the royal taste..It had alot of vegetables and the mint raita too tastes well..I am Not from hyderabad..Tastes first time biryani here...Now I can say why it's so famous..Full marks to awesome packaging.on time delivery...At the end I must say..Add on it to ur bucket list..
Behrouz Biryani,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,01 February 2019,4,"Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie.. I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.

I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.

Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well.

Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

Overall -
Taste : 3.5/5
Price : 3.5/5
Packaging : 4/5
VFM: 3.5/5"
Behrouz Biryani,Nandini Bhattacharjee,27 January 2019,1,Please deliver in time when you take an order. Your service sucks. And so does your delivery algorithm!! How can you show 0 minutes for 15 minutes near the delivery location
Behrouz Biryani,Sagar Zanwar,20 January 2019,1,I usually order from here. today biryani was 50% in quantity.
Behrouz Biryani,Vishnu Vardan,16 January 2019,1,"Pathetic service, i ordered twice they r nvr be on time and the taste is worst...
Nvr go for it. That's it nothing more than to review about behrouz"
Behrouz Biryani,Snehal Gautam,29 December 2018,3,"I ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murg Biriyani. After seeing the Royal Box of Biriyani, I was really happy. Whole packaging of raita and Gulab Jamun was upto the mark and really good. But then the taste, it tastes sweet. Everything was good from packaging to the Mouth freshner they gave but I didnt like the taste of biriyani.The quantity was good, and was garnished with almonds and cashew."
Behrouz Biryani,Anamay Tamrakar (Aman),29 December 2018,3,"The only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me. Sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings. Coz the dish looks pretty but..... Similarly, the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich. But at the end wasn't satisfying."
Behrouz Biryani,Bhavani Sankar Raju Machiraju,24 December 2018,3,It is just average coming to taste. You dont feeI that lavishness as you feel from the hoardings and all. I have ordered from swiggy and quantity is not sufficient for 1person. At this price better we can pick many options. Better dont take it.
Behrouz Biryani,MadhuKar Madhukar,24 December 2018,3,"I have ordered two box's of Chicken Biryani the chicken piece were too less, not what I was expecting for the amount I have spent  on a so called Royal Biryani... hope the feedback is taken positively and acted upon"
Behrouz Biryani,Sam,24 December 2018,1,i did not get my order and i have paid for it already . There is no customer number of Zomato as well. I need my money back asap. Zomato guys should have a customer care number or any way to track order there is no support present. i need my money or food asap.
Behrouz Biryani,Sritika Shekher,23 December 2018,2,"Biryani aroma is good. But aroma is too strong for the taste buds. Chiken well cooked. My only concern is plz use little lesser aroma so that our stomach has got space for the food as well, rather than only having aromas. Taste of biryani is average ."
Behrouz Biryani,Nikita.ved,21 December 2018,2.5,Biryani is good but they didn't deliver ...I had to pick it and that too was informed very last minute...the address mentioned did say it's a fassos only take away facility for food delivery companies like swiggy n zomato... I was standing there at 10 at night to pick my parcel...very poor service
Behrouz Biryani,Chhetri Kumar Ramu,17 December 2018,5,"Awesome food, great experience so far! The food as been great every time I order. I highly recommend their mutton and Murg biryani. Delivery by zomato has also bee good!"
Behrouz Biryani,Banjit Das,17 December 2018,1,"Horrible experience..I would not rate them at all but since I could not save it without a star, I'm just giving it a star. They had accepted my order and in about 40 minutes when I was expecting my order to arrive, called them, to my surprise they have just said that they could not deliver my item since they have other pending orders..be professional or at least have some courtesy!!"
Behrouz Biryani,Aman Agarwal,16 December 2018,5,A briyani worth a war is biryani worth a try. Truely Royal biryani. Right from the packing of biryani to the last rice left everything about was Royal. Although I didn't like the Gulab Jamun but as I said biryani worth a try.
Behrouz Biryani,Farooq Imran Khan,15 December 2018,1,Late delivery. Cold food.
Behrouz Biryani,Varma,14 December 2018,1,Highly disappointed there is a sea of change in the quality of biryani we ordered last and now its awfully spicy and too wet like eating rice and curry
Behrouz Biryani,Amit Pradhan,14 December 2018,1,"Pathetic biryani ever I had. In my life.. If u really wants to eat biryani then don't order for here.. Better look for other options..

Only the packing is good but food is not at all good.."
Behrouz Biryani,John Rajendran,13 December 2018,1,This is a good joint that doesn't care for customer. They accept order and don't care to deliver and they don't pick the call neither they respect customers.
Behrouz Biryani,Kattarajeswari,13 December 2018,5,The best biryani place. If you are nearby around you can have a look at this place this is place. Best biryani all the biryani tests very good. They have the old mughals spices which tastes sop unique and very good. It's mouth watering biryani.
Behrouz Biryani,Thati Deepshikha,13 December 2018,5,"One of the best place to have biryani in the city this Is one if the beat place to have biryani in Hyderabad. We were group of friend had almost all of the biryani present their. All the biryani were very good. Nice place to hangout here. I recommend this place to everyone.

Ambiance 5/5
Food 5/5
Quality 5/5
Overall 5/5"
Behrouz Biryani,Sankalp Chokkarapu,12 December 2018,2,"#Zomato Review program
Ordered veg Shahi subz Dastarkwan which comes with the combination of veg Subz-e-biryani and falafel-e-khees. To my suprise I ordered veg and I got non-veg biryani I dont know was that an upgrade for me ?!

Nothing changed but got an add on ‚Äúthe black box‚Äù which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good. The package was good like before and as expected. Nothing to say about that biryani because I didn‚Äôt taste it. On an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over. Need to improve alot with the service and also taking the taste into consideration for a hyderabadi."
Behrouz Biryani,Krishna Jangid,12 December 2018,1,not received any order from your restaurant
Behrouz Biryani,Shagoon Gurtata,10 December 2018,1,Worst place for vegetarians. They serve chicken pieces in veg paneer biryani and mark their box with green labels. Irresponsible team hiered spoillers.
Behrouz Biryani,Ashoku2018,09 December 2018,1,I am very very biryani lover and I tried the Behrouz biryani and it was worst. Taste is too bad üëé. Packing is too good but taste is too bad
Behrouz Biryani,Mayank Kalra,08 December 2018,1,"Packing is good, but we have paid for it..
Salan - over spicey.
Briyani rice is good , over masala and very less pieces of chicken .. not happy"
Behrouz Biryani,Sunkara Karuna,06 December 2018,1,They have not delivered the order and the number they mentioned to call is not reachable. We waited nearly 2hrs neither order received or zomato sup port cant do anything about the delivery. Finally we have not received the order. But mail has come to provide the review. Be careful while ordering from this restaurant.
Behrouz Biryani,@foodie.amy6 | AMNA,04 December 2018,5,"Behrouz Biryani is listed on zomato and offers online ordering via zomato, Scrumptious food you can eat in the comfort of your home. We ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biryani, Quantity and taste & fragrance is good(flavorsome and non spicy), price is on the higher side but totally worth it. What I really loved is, received a complimentary dessert (gulab jamun) the presentation and packaging was amazing . A must try for all biryani lovers!"
Behrouz Biryani,Prasanna Daula,29 November 2018,4,Amount of chicken given in biryani was very less.. Taste wise it was good.. packing wise it was amazing..
Behrouz Biryani,Srikanth Merugu,29 November 2018,1,Worst Biryani I ever had... Kickout these blady Biryani from hyderabad..... Spoiled the taste and stinking smell from the rice.. Lokks like they served last night Biryani.. I have throwed Biryani on
Behrouz Biryani,Aditya Kumar,26 November 2018,4,"First impression when i looked at the box i was like Awee! üòØ The food was packed very well and the Gulab jamun in the box has truly surprised me! I had ordered chicken biryani for lunch, this order was a delivery one.
As I‚Äôm a native from Hyd I like the biryani to be having dum and spicy. The biryani was less spicey but was good. If few more pieces of meat were added, it would have been great.
A bit pricey though. I will definitely try the mutton biryani next time!"
Behrouz Biryani,Joydeep Barman,25 November 2018,4,"Now this was a surprise.... I thought it can't be good like they are saying but its really gr8, specially the ghost biryani... Ordered dum ghost biryani & lajeez bhuna murgh biryani. The packing was excellent. The biryani was soo good. Very nice... Served with one gulab jamun also...."
Behrouz Biryani,Sachin K,24 November 2018,1,"Worst biryani i never tested
ambiance is soo colourful to attract the customer
I m giving 1 rating bcoz if the rating star is less than 0 i definitely give u 0 There is no restaurant bcoz ur face will be smashed after they ate
Bloody biryani"
Behrouz Biryani,Abhilash Inumella,24 November 2018,1,I ordered chicken Biryani. It's awful. Its not fresh. It's stored. I had stomach ache after eating it. I also got a gulab jamun and that's very bad too. All the taste is lost. On top of all this the price touches the roof.
Behrouz Biryani,Garlicperiperi,23 November 2018,3,#foodengineering One of the new tastes of biryanis in hyd we ordered bone less chicken biryani and mutton biryani which comes with Gulab jamun .the packing is also up to mark
Behrouz Biryani,Sainath Konapure,22 November 2018,1,I dont like this biryani. Worst biryani. Not having taste. Its doesnt mean that biryani taste is good if they are adding almonds in biryani. It should in good taste from inside. On top of this biryani price is too much.
Behrouz Biryani,SONIYA SINHA,21 November 2018,4,"My husband is fan of biryani served by them so he insisted me to try. We ordered 1 Chicken n 1 Mutton biryani both turned out to be full of flavors, ‚Äòheavenly‚Äô in short. Very nice compact packaging, ready to take in case one is travelling. It is a full-fledged meal with mint raita, dessert n cutlery. Good quantity of meat pieces & rice quality at the same time.

It definitely breaks the traditional concept of a ‚Äòbiryani‚Äô. I personally felt, that though it is super delicious, it should be named pulao not biryani. Last but not the least absolutely great at taste and worth the try."
Behrouz Biryani,Hari Talla,20 November 2018,4,"Package was Kewl!!
Biryani was dry tbh, anyhow a different taste it was."
Behrouz Biryani,Ramu,19 November 2018,1,Waste food
Behrouz Biryani,Kalyan Madduru,14 November 2018,4,"Heard lots of times about this Royal biryani.... Finally placed order for Murgh Makhani biryani.
Firstly, packaging was good, seemed like a gift box with cutlery and mouth freshener. Then, coming to biryani, Aroma was pleasant and circulated over the entire room within no time. Chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth. Biryani tasted sweet, even with lots of masala, unlike the other conventional Hyderabadi spicy ones. Two add-On options available, Mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required. Quantity and quality of rice is good.

Summing it up, behrouz Royal biryani is definitely worth a try, if you got bored of eating spicy Hyderabadi biryani's."
Behrouz Biryani,Naresh Kumar Dhotre,12 November 2018,2,"Heard lot about behrouz biryani. So, I ordered dum ghost biryani. Packaging was impressive & quantity also pretty decent, and about taste my only suggestion is keora water or gulab jal whatever you've used will help to enhance the aroma of the food not the taste. You guys have to work on flavour rather than adding too much aroma."
Behrouz Biryani,Sai,04 November 2018,4,"I ordered chicken Buryani. It's so tasty.
The packing was awesome.
The quantity - easily it's enough for 2people.
Raitha, gravy all are good .
And 1sweet. Gulabjamoon. üëåüëåüëå.
Mainly packing and look is too good. I suggested it to my friends they also loved it."
Behrouz Biryani,Ravina Panthri,04 November 2018,5,Husain Ali has a very good communication skill.
Behrouz Biryani,Ankita Shilpa,04 November 2018,4,"I had ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biriyani from Behrouz Biriyani. The packaging really impressed me, because in case of Biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but Behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani. I would love to try out other Biriyanis from Behrouz later some time :)"
Behrouz Biryani,Chinni Vijay,02 November 2018,5,I like the taste but only drawback is that food is not serving hot like shah ghouse does
Behrouz Biryani,Amar,23 October 2018,4,need more quantity..because We paid toomuch for a single biriyani...
Behrouz Biryani,SHYAMAL,21 October 2018,4,"Biryani ‚ù§Ô∏è Not just a food for Hyderabadis , it's a important part of the routine , love to see them eating it with so much of love .. when they serve you so nicely and it makes you eat it like a monster. This restaurant is serving similar to the home-made biryani which can make you feel like home .. It was worth and you people should change your taste now. Try this restaurant and I'm sure you might get used to this tasteüòã"
Behrouz Biryani,Subbu G,20 October 2018,5,good food and tasty
Behrouz Biryani,Rohan Shah,18 October 2018,1,i ordered my food and confirmed with restaurant. after 40 mints wait he didnt delivered. then i call them again and they said they are not delivering to my area. what the hell is this if order is done then why they are not delivering to my area. Then i had to go to restaurant to take my food that time. Really disappointed with this restaurant.
Behrouz Biryani,Sudhir,17 October 2018,1,"One of the worst biryani's I ever had by paying a price of 300+ (just one plate). They claim they are authentic (may be at their house), but won't come near to real hyd biryani. Please don't waste your money by giving it a try."
Behrouz Biryani,Chinni Vijay,07 October 2018,5,whenever we order we want onions and lemons as well that we see lacking except that everything was awesome service
Behrouz Biryani,Niveditha Reddy,03 October 2018,2,"Ordered lazeez murgh biriyani, quantity is good, taste is not good..biriyani is very sweet, mint raita is also not good, they didn't give onion salad also"
Behrouz Biryani,Saravana Kumar,29 September 2018,1,"poor service, lake of responsibility, very very worst"
Behrouz Biryani,Krishna Krishna,27 September 2018,5,Fast delivery
Behrouz Biryani,Jyoti Kothari,23 September 2018,5,I never used to like biryani. But after getting many reviews i ordered biryani. It was so dam delicious.. fragnace was also amazing.. pavking was also too good. Pepole who dont like biryani should try once. They will fall in love with behrouz biryani
Behrouz Biryani,Sabyasachi Mohanty,22 September 2018,5,"One of the best biryani I have ever had in Hyderabad. The Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biryani(Boneless), the chicken just melts in the mouth. Tried it the first time."
Behrouz Biryani,Naveen Yavvari,21 September 2018,2,"I have ordered a biriyani and the restaurant took close to one hour just to prepare the food. And the zomato delivery person took 30 more mins to deliver the food. One of the worst service from zomato. 

When it comes to the food, it was pretty average. I dint feel like i am having a biriyani."
Behrouz Biryani,Nageswar R,21 September 2018,2,"Not provided any carry bags, difficult to Cary multiple packs one time. biryani quality not good"
Behrouz Biryani,Esli Jacinth,20 September 2018,5,"I don't have the exact words to describe how amaaaaaazzziinnggggg the chicken kheema biryani was. It felt like food which God's eat, mouth watering, explosion of flavors in the mouth, literally Diwali came early inside my mouth.
The complimentary Gulab jammun, thanks for that!
Best packaging ever!
Best cutlery ever!
I've been in Hyderabad since 18 years and I've a new favorite place for Biryani.
Praises and blessings, thank you so much!"
Behrouz Biryani,Achyuth,15 September 2018,5,"Always at its best, service or taste...............................................................yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyy.................."

Behrouz Biryani,Venkat Varma Indukuri,12 September 2018,2,"Ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biryani (Boneless).really disappointed with the the food ,quality and quantity wise its decent. but taste wise its bad ."
Behrouz Biryani,CHITTA NIKHILA,11 September 2018,1,Very poor servicing. No communication from the restraunt even after 90 minutes of ordering the food. Very disappointed. This is how they treat their customers
Behrouz Biryani,Shreyansh Sahay,10 September 2018,1,"ORDER NO: 14001414 :-You did not deliver my food and cancelled it without notifying me.Please refund my money.Worst customer experience.

10th Sep 2018, 5:09 pm was the time of order.I expect my money back atleast"
Behrouz Biryani,Sanjeet Kumar Bhukta,08 September 2018,5,"I heard about behrouz biriyani many times from my friends . So finally ordred dum ghost biriyani as I am a mutton lover.

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste."
Behrouz Biryani,Teja,05 September 2018,4,"There is no gulab jamun, so reducing one star"
Behrouz Biryani,Deepa Arora,30 August 2018,4,A rich flavoured Bhuna Murg biryani from this place surely will delight ur taste buds. As I opened the box of my Biryani the aroma was so tempting. It tasted yum topped with lots of deep fried onions and almonds. It has more of the Lucknowi Biryani taste. The only reason I don‚Äôt give it a 5 is it is way too rich as a meal.
Behrouz Biryani,Praveen Sai,27 August 2018,1,"@delivery, poor customer support. Both me and zomato were unable to contact restaurant. Restaurant didn't update status in app as well. After 3 hours a guy called me that he is out to deliver the food. Which is hours after I requested zomato customer care and cancelled my order. And it happened second time. Earlier they answered but said it will take one and half hour I waited and not delivered. This is my second bad experience... Very sad about it."
Behrouz Biryani,Sree Leela,27 August 2018,4,Ordered biryani from this place and the packing is the first thing we liked about it...its the best and not the regular biryani packing you get...The biryani tastes...It has a different kind of mughal style..
Behrouz Biryani,Varallika Mehta,23 August 2018,5,We loved your biryanis. The two accompanying complimentary side dish (raita and gulab jamun) were delicious as well. The whole experience was wonderful and satisfying. Thank you so much for the lovely meal and the prompt service :)
Behrouz Biryani,Vuyyuru Surendra,21 August 2018,1,"I have ordered dum ghost biryani ,the biryani is bad,cold and the rice is dry as it is left rice to air...I felt regretted after ordering this..there is nothing good tell aboutthis... I felt waste of money after ordering this.."

Hunger Maggi Point,Deepali,15 May 2019,4,Ordered Paneer maggi and it tasted really really good. It was hot and juicy. The quantity of maggi was good but there were only 4-5 tiny pieces of paneer.
Hunger Maggi Point,Aditi Bhaiji,30 April 2019,3,"I ordered an veg corn Maggie which was okay to eat . But the fried maggie's are much more tempting and more tasty .
The only drawback on visiting the shop is that they only accept the cash ."
Hunger Maggi Point,Pavan,24 April 2019,5,Delivered before the time specifed
Hunger Maggi Point,Pallavi Mitra,23 April 2019,1,"The Maggie masala is put alot in the Maggie, could you please make good Maggie rather than making it very spicy ? The masala makes it too spicy and tastes raw. Please improve on the taste. Thank you for the speedy delivery."
Hunger Maggi Point,Buddiga Sindhuri,18 April 2019,4,"Its a small stall beside synergy park campus odc4.
They have Maggie and also fried Maggie too.i ate vegetable fried maggie which is very good to taste and it is around 40rs and also you can see the menu card given and non Vegas maggie is also good here.They have limited editions of Maggie but all of them are good.

Food 5/5"
Hunger Maggi Point,Prabhat Ray,15 April 2019,1,I ordered a shawarma and I received a rotten shawarma. I don't understand why people do this. It's food. Not any product. If you want to increase the price. Do it. But how can you serve this type of food to anyone. This is completely rotten and even smells very bad. Would never order from you again.
Hunger Maggi Point,Akshara Veera,12 April 2019,3,"Fried Maggie's are better compared with the normal one, Normal Maggie's are prepared like soup with more water also sometimes they let the Maggie to burn and add water in it ,that would be horrible. Good to go as a midnight snack."
Hunger Maggi Point,Sudha.sparkles,12 April 2019,2,It tasted worst. There were no vegetables in vegetable maggi except cabbage and paid extra for cheese which was stinking. Will not recommend nor order again. Waste of money
Hunger Maggi Point,Prasun Gokhlani,06 April 2019,4,Go to place for my midnight snacks. Have tried almost all the different varieties of Maggi served and the place hasnt dissapointed yet. Chicken fried Maggi being my favourite.
Hunger Maggi Point,Mahathi Natva,04 April 2019,4,"Ordered a double Chicken and double egg Maggi and an egg Maggi. It was delivered to me while it was still hot and steamy that way you can be sure that it isn't sticky or soggy. It also tasted really good and was cooked properly. They had good amount of egg and chicken in both the dishes. The quantity was really good and it is worth the money.
Taste : 4/5."

Delivery : 5/5
Packaging : 5/5"
Hunger Maggi Point,Umed Mohammed,26 February 2019,4,"The price is reasonable and the quantity is okay but the taste of fried Maggie was good.

Request them not to add to cabbage in more quantity which will sometimes ruin all the taste but overall taste was good.

I said rate this restaurant 7/10.

This restaurant is the only hunger saviour during mid night."
Hunger Maggi Point,Tharun Kumar,25 February 2019,5,good boy
Hunger Maggi Point,Vishnu Vardhan Nerella,21 February 2019,4,Good place for late night ordering ...but sometimes it comes like complete masala and taste also disappointed... But overall dirrent Maggie's in this place .. ....
Hunger Maggi Point,Gauri Srivastava,17 February 2019,1,"Really bad food. Filled with chilli.

I you hate someone give it to them. They will surely suffer the next day.

They fucked up Maggie. I don't know what kind of cook they have.

Unprofessional, really bad"
Hunger Maggi Point,Indradipta Sardar,11 February 2019,4,Perfect for tackling hunger. Several varieties of maggi are available. Good in taste and pocket friendly. Not a fan of spicy food so wish a little less spice is given in them.
Hunger Maggi Point,Nillu,11 February 2019,4,First time i ate non veg Maggie from this place. Test was good i prefer this place because its near to my office and its reasonable also .. good place for khatty
Hunger Maggi Point,Charan Reddy,07 February 2019,3,"Famous place just before the DLF building in gachibowli,they have a wide variety of Maggi and I would always pick their authentic fried Maggi better to have it at the place rather than ordering online, quantity gets reduces when ordered online than you eat at Maggi point"
Hunger Maggi Point,Amatullah (Lifeofafoody),02 February 2019,3,"It's a very small food joint like a pan shop and very crowded since there are many other food joints in the same lane.
It's nothing exceptional but if you really love Maggi then you can give it a try.
We tried fried chicken maggi but are doubtful of it being halal üòê
If anyone knows about it, please let me know."
Hunger Maggi Point,Anupam Agarwal,31 January 2019,3,"Its a small joint located near the DLF IT Park. Well who doesnt love Maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. You can either visit the place or even place order online. I have tried both methods with varying experience. 
I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby. 

Overall 3 
Food 3 
Value for Money 4"
Hunger Maggi Point,Ana Kochila,28 January 2019,2,Too dry and very less stuffing
Hunger Maggi Point,Gayatri Tandon,26 January 2019,2,"I've called for their veg as well as chicken fried Maggie a hundred of times just because it is so delicious and has a different taste from all the other Maggie places around. However, 2 days back when I ordered the food, it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there. I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess. People always say, avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all, but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order. So I guess never risking my stomach again. Going to miss that Maggie so much üò∑"

Hunger Maggi Point,Udita,18 January 2019,1,"I used to really love this place and food!! The problem is with how the zomato deliveryman assigned to deliver my food, didn't deliver my food. My order was paid online and he took my order for himself. He turned off his phone and didn't answer!. Even zomato didn't update me about the follow-up. I never got my food.Just the money was refunded, that's all! But is this what you get when you really need to eat and wait like hell,but get nothing!!This is really frustrating!! I don't know why zomato is ruining it's own reputation!."
Hunger Maggi Point,Kumar Biswajit Swain,07 January 2019,1,I have ordered Double Egg and Double Chicken Maggie. I think this is a single egg with chicken less Meggie.I didn't feel the teast of chicken.Very less egg and chicken quantity they packed.

Hunger Maggi Point,Kolani Nikhila,24 December 2018,1,Not good and fresh. I was thinking to have happy meal but disappointed now. Hope to have tasty Maggi. Maggi is sticky and fried Maggi is also not good.
Hunger Maggi Point,Subhanjan Ray,24 December 2018,1,"Ordered through Zomato for two dishes maggi's with chicken. There was hardly any chicken at all. Wonder how it's double chicken. Moreover, quality wasn't good either."
Hunger Maggi Point,Susmitha Illa,16 December 2018,2,the quantity is very less..
Hunger Maggi Point,John Son,15 December 2018,5,"I would highly recommend you to order Maggie at late nights !!
I am late night eater and I find this Maggi point available everytime !!
Tasty üòã"
Hunger Maggi Point,Ashok Prabhakaran,14 December 2018,3,"I used to spot this shop opposite to the DLF IT park while coming back from work during my stay in Hyderabad. Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel. Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night.

I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. 

The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.  Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles."
Hunger Maggi Point,Kaushik Padmanaban,09 December 2018,5,"This restaurant is a saviour. This is the answer for my late night hunger pangs and my snack time cravings. Whenever I'm feeling too hungry to eat biscuits but not hungry enough to eat dinner, I order Maggi from Hunger Maggi Point. It's the best. The double egg double chicken fried Maggi is my favourite. Clubbed with offers, which is often, these are the cheapest and tastiest solution to your hunger. Keep up the good work, fellas."
Hunger Maggi Point,PADMANABHAM JAYAVARAPU,09 December 2018,1,"As this Maggi point located at a demanding place, they least bothered about the food ordered online and send us the poor quality food . Better not to order online and do if you wanna waste your money."

Hunger Maggi Point,Hungry Soul,26 October 2018,4,"Strictly vegetarian~~

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.

I am sure you have already had this sometime, if not you should surely try coz who doesn't like Maggie right!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @hungermaggipoint üòÄ"

The operating time is just perfect. This place is open through the night and the area is lit. You could just go here have a cheap sumptuous meal of Maggie be it 2 or 3 am.

One portion is quite enough to fill your stomach. The place reminds one of college days and Maggi in the stalls around if you can relate.

Personal favourite: veg fried Maggi, would also recommend to try cheese veg Maggi."

Pot Pourri,Asha Tejaswini,17 May 2019,1,I had the worst experience with the food and the service.Food is not great and the service took so long.The place is not totally air-conditioned and the staff is a bit rude to customers.
Pot Pourri,Chandrasekhar Dasika,13 May 2019,1,"*IF YOU ARE READING THIS, AND SITLL GOING TO THIS PLACE - EITHER YOU WORK THERE OR YOU ARE DU#B*
*I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE FAMILIES WITH KIDS FROM VISITING THIS PLACE*

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). And in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble."
Pot Pourri,Saikrishna Javvaji,11 May 2019,4,"went for A-LA-Carte here.. Heard a lot about this previously. went with full of excitement. I wanna rate this restaurant in 3 aspects. 1. Ambience: I should say it is just OK. they could have done it much better. Looks like they have spent a lot on establishment but no aww factor. 2.Taste: The food tastes good here. Almost every main course and starter were good except the dessert - Carrot Halwa and Mango Juice(Welcome Drink). They both didn't taste good. 3.Hospitality: The Hospitality is quite good. I was satisfied with the staff in the restaurant.

As a whole, I would recommend going here. You will love the food."
Pot Pourri,Sarada Mylavarapu,09 May 2019,4,"Vegetarian options in this place were really good, buffet has some good options, special mention to panasa Kaya curry, not so many options in dessert, overall a decent place easily to locate"
Pot Pourri,Swetha Talasu,09 May 2019,4,Been here for 2 times... Food is good in both alacart and buffet servings... Ambience is ok ... Seafood tasted much better... Lemon chicken has been my fav dish
Pot Pourri,Vijay,08 May 2019,2,Food is really very disappointing. Kheema pulao had many chicken pieces and rice was cooked very bad. Even kheema was not prepared well.awful experience
Pot Pourri,Madhan Mohan Reddy,08 May 2019,5,I have been to Pot Pourri along with my Colleague for Lunch. We had Pot Pourri Chicken Roast and Mamsam(Mutton) Pulao .Both were delicious.One must try these for sure. Highly recommended place .They do have Buffet as well.Worth giving a shot üçΩ
Pot Pourri,Neha Aggarwal,07 May 2019,1,"We booked for 40 people for an office party and it was a complete chaos. Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served. What a big mess it was. The complete team of 40 was disappointed."
Pot Pourri,Lakshmi Prasanna,06 May 2019,3,"Here I can‚Äôt say the food is so tasty, it was okay you can enjoy some specific items in chicken those are nice.. and the ambience also normal but it was nice in the nights we can enjoy the outside view.."
Pot Pourri,Sharath.gannu6,05 May 2019,4,I got a lot of stuff which are cooked in pot those are simply awesome i really loved the starters very much and mainly the pulavs are superr
Pot Pourri,Eshwar Phani Paruchuri,04 May 2019,4,"A great restaurant with pretty good ambience.
The food tastes good but the price is a bit high.
A good place for good food and with a suburban view."
Pot Pourri,Anvesh Gudivada,03 May 2019,2,"I came here 1 hour back . It took them 15 mins to find a table for me. And then the waiter comes and tells half the menu is not available. Hmm...I have already wasted 25 mins time.. so ordered what was available...

Now I am still waiting for the food...

If you are hungry please don't visit this restaurant"
Pot Pourri,Rajani,03 May 2019,5,Must visit place for all non veg N spicy food lovers.liked all different chicken varieties N pulao items here..ambience N overall nice place
Pot Pourri,Manideep,02 May 2019,5,"Good Food and Service is Also fast and Good, ambiance is the best part,biswajit is one of the best server in this whole place food is good and quality and quantity are also good"
Pot Pourri,Anusha Gazaram,02 May 2019,3,This might be good incase you are looking for ala Carte. But if you choose buffet one will be disappointed with the spread. The items are tasty but the spread is too small. Need to improve it.
Pot Pourri,Prasant Kumar,29 April 2019,5,"All Star to the Food, Service and ambience... We were looking for a good banquet or Restaurant in Gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th Marriage anniversary. As the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends. Searched almost 5-6 locations but bottomed down to Pot Pourri. Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:
1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..

The starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..

2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... 

3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... 

Kudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS..."
Pot Pourri,Suchitra Maagala,27 April 2019,5,"Good food, quiet ambience, apt for leisure lunch. Good service as well. Well worth the price. The buffet has enough varieties to indulge in. Over all a good place to relish the food."
Pot Pourri,Priyanka,22 April 2019,2,"We have ordered Paneer Manchurian but all pieces of paneer are very hard to bite struggled alot, got irritated that's why we won't prefer this to anyone"
Pot Pourri,Mr. Ego,20 April 2019,4,"A good place with a calm ambience and a lot of pots.
We went in for the √Ä la carte. The service was a bit slow, they need to speed up on that. We ordered crispy baby corn. Usually not a fan of corn, but loved this one. Also, the masala papad was a good one. We went ahead with the main course. The kadai paneer and rumali roti were good. Would give it a 3.5/5.
Overall, a place with a different theme and calm ambience. This place is worth a visit and is also economical.
(Top pick : Crispy Baby Corn)"
Pot Pourri,Tahishi Gupta,18 April 2019,3,Ordered mushroom chilli and keema biryani. Mushroom chilli was fine but the biryani tasted like pulao. It dint have any aroma and it was not even close to biryani. Totally tasteless.
Pot Pourri,The Other Foodie,18 April 2019,4,"While scrolling through the 1+1 on food offer options in Zomato gold, we happened to end up at potpourri which is located in a very accessible area in Gachibowli.

The place opens up to you with nicely set up wall decorations which says true to the restaurants name ( with a lot of pots üòâ) and amazing ambience.

We happened to drop by on a weekday towards the closing time.

The staff was still courteous enough to take as many orders as we want.

We ordered :

Honey chilli potato - 4/5

Veg Seekh kebab - 4/5

Masala Papad - 3/5

Butter Chicken - 3/5

Butter Naan - 4/5

Dal Tadka - 3/5

The food and service here is commendable and the ambience is really nice."
Pot Pourri,Kartik Bhardwaj,15 April 2019,3,"This place is for peace. If you‚Äôre looking for ambience,try going on the fifth floor. Food is edible but not what i was expecting. Overall, the place was doable to hangout."
Pot Pourri,Debaraja Ojha,10 April 2019,5,Hi so me and my friend enjoy in lunch time with a Indian food restaurant food is good service is little bit slow I love the song improve in less spicy food
Pot Pourri,Tazz Alexis,09 April 2019,4,"Really loved the ambience, great music and of course the FOOD..!! Agreed the menu is pretty simple (less variety) but the food tastes yummy!! Do try their Paneer Majestic and Kaju Pulao! Always a smile on his face, our server Vijay Kumar was very prompt in his service. This place is worth your wallet."
Pot Pourri,Parijat Ray,08 April 2019,3,"We visited this restaurant recently. We have ordered Potpourri Royyala Vepudu, Gongura Mamsam ( not there in the menu, they have made it on our request ) and plain rice.

Potpourri Royyala Vepudu: A south Indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). This dish had at least 15-20 prawns. The prawns were coated and cooked in spices. The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

Gongura Mamsam: Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. We found this dish too sour ( I guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy.

Overall experience was nice. The service was good."
Pot Pourri,Prasun Gokhlani,06 April 2019,4,Loved the food here. I felt that the ambience can be improved and that extra spice can be added with some more colours. Felt a bit bland. However the food made up for it.
Pot Pourri,Akarsh Prabhu,03 April 2019,2,"Had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana Cuisine. 
Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani. 

The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. It looked like some home made beginner dish. It was really dry. The server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. It was above normal levels. Otherwise no special flavour. The dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, OURSELF. 
There was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

After all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place."
Pot Pourri,Afreen Jahan,29 March 2019,1,"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested."
Pot Pourri,Farhad Tarapore,27 March 2019,3,"Ordered chicken fried rice. Quantity is huge. Taste is strictly ok. The chicken pieces were not nice and I got some bones and cartilage in some of those. So, wouldn't recommend to order chinese again from here. Perhaps their other items are better, not sure."
Pot Pourri,Akhila Boga,26 March 2019,4,"This place is known for its authentic regional cuisine. It was a small and good ambiance place.
We ordered pot pouri royala vepudu which was amazing and hot and sour chicken soup which was good in taste . Pachi mirchi kodi pulao was also great."
Pot Pourri,Rakhi,25 March 2019,3,"I went there last Sunday. Had a buffet. Honestly I didn't like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially non-veg items. It tasted stale. No doubt service is good , staff is always smiling. But they need to improve a lot on food quality. Even the biryani was not up to the mark. Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home."
Pot Pourri,Yashwanth,22 March 2019,4,I've been here for lunch. The place has a very good ambience. Staff were polite. Food needs a special mention here. We've ordered cashew pulav (south indian style) and Kadai Panner. Both the items are at their best in taste. Kadai Panner is purely love. Will definitely suggest this place. Hope to visit here soon again.
Pot Pourri,Abhishek Katta,21 March 2019,4,Must try Pachimirchi Biriyani. Nice and cosy place. Service is good. Reasonable cost. The quantity is bit less. But overall good experience.
Pot Pourri,Vinuthna,19 March 2019,1,"They took the reservation before 4 days for buffet. But when we reached there, they are saying there is no reservation on that name and we have no buffet today. They wasted our time and response is not at all proper."
Pot Pourri,Puneet Arora,17 March 2019,3,"Staff is good and courteous, but the food is pretty average. Not a lot of options to choose from. Nothing great. Ambience also is pretty average."
Pot Pourri,The Foodie Bookworm,15 March 2019,2,Except for service and the starters to some extent nothing was good at this place we tried the buffet and after starters nothing was worth eating and I successfully wasted Rs.649 .I hope they improve it when I visit the next time.
Pot Pourri,Asisha Ayachitula,12 March 2019,3,"So I met my brother here for lunch yesterday.

We ordered spring rolls, kaju paneer curry and butter naans.

The best amongst the order was the starter. The curry was just okay, with strong turmeric after taste.

The breads we ordered also arrived cold which made them difficult to chew.

Overall, just an average experience. Would have enjoyed if the naans were better and the curry didn't have so much turmeric in it."
Pot Pourri,Manisha Panda,11 March 2019,1,"Went here for a team lunch party a while back and I swear to God the food was pathetic. The starters they server were cold and even after calling out the waiter multiple times there wasn't a positive response.
When we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
The ambience is good though. If only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.
All we ate that day was curd rice üòë the entire team.
I wish you guys could improve and we would try here again."
Pot Pourri,Uma Shankar Veeravalli,10 March 2019,5,"Wow man! It's a great place for a happy dine. Their ambiance, their food and their service is just awesome. The prices are higher than average and trust me, it's completely worth it."
Pot Pourri,Sandeep Sandy,09 March 2019,1,"Worst service provided!!!! The ambience felt like a zombie area. The team over there was very confused for nothing.From the time they started taking the order til the time of the bill the waiters were so unpleasant,so unhappy,so irritating(especially a lady there) OMG that lady started giving rude replies when we asked for service . The manager there was "" Lost ""too. Food wasn't that great, it's not worth that price. Overall experience was horribleüòë#Totally unhappy# Never recommend anyone who opts for a good lunch or dinner"
Pot Pourri,Mit Shah,09 March 2019,4,"Decent place for casual dining...
If someone has Zomato Gold membership one should visit.
Two person can eat a paneer starter and Rice/Noodles for 250.
Food Taste :- 3.5/5
Ambience :- 4/5
Quantity :- 4.5/5
Service :- 3/5"
Pot Pourri,Kalyan Madduru,09 March 2019,4,"Pot pourri is one of the budget friendly restaurants in Gachibowli, Indira Nagar, where we can find Telugu cuisine menu along with North Indian and Chinese one's. Ambience was good. Corporate team lunches and dinners make this place crowdy.

We have ordered starter as pot pourri chepa and special chicken biryani boneless. Welcome drink watermelon juice was served. Pot pourri chepa is a must try, loaded with spices and sauces. Fish was too soft inside and crispy outside just like we desired it to be. Special chicken biryani boneless was not in the menu, but was made and served. It tasted good as well.

Service was nice, staff frequently asked for taste of dishes and any spice level changes if required. It was really a good try with zomato GOLD ,as special chicken biryani was complimentary. Paid only for starter. Thanks Zomato !"
Pot Pourri,Lakshmi,08 March 2019,1,Service was horrible. Waiters dint even feel like taking the order....(the resturant was not busy also for giving that as an excuse) Resturant has very poor service
Pot Pourri,Amar Jyoti,08 March 2019,2,"Not many varieties available. Taste not that good.
Ambience not good too. Don't understand why people have rated it so high on zomato. Went for team lunch, it was complete waste of money. Everyone was so unhappy that we made this decision."
Pot Pourri,Shashi Prakash,07 March 2019,4,"Pot Pourri does maintain good food hiegene. I have ordered Paneer sticks twice from here and love the taste. Had ordered chicken biryani as well, was Okayish as not that spicy."
Pot Pourri,Bharadwaj,04 March 2019,5,Very good range of food availble and especially the veg good was really good. Quantity n Quality meets the price. Ambience is simple too and very friendly staff.
Pot Pourri,Yash Barmecha,03 March 2019,4,"It is a good place to be. The ambience is very friendly. The food is on par with what you expect. The prices are decent enough and is not very easy to locate. Although, if you're using Google maps, then it's easy to find."
Pot Pourri,Jay Mehta,03 March 2019,3,"Had ordered honey chilli potatoes and veg manchurian from here for a small meetup at home..everyone and i really liked the honey chilli potatoes, the manchurian was very average..was ooozing oil on the bite and didnt hv any manchurian taste..

Didnt go gaga about it nor did i not like it, will try again perhaps this time in the restaurant."
Pot Pourri,Sreekanth Koppula,28 February 2019,1,I have been to this place for my team lunch on 22nd Feb. We opted for buffet. Just to serve the soup they took 20 mins and starters for another 15 mins. Apparently they didn‚Äôt serve the soup to all my team members and when we tried talking to the manager he was not available neither the servers. They hardly have any options available for veg or non-veg. Food taste is not great and whole service is pathetic. What we thought will be a memorable time resulted in frustration for choosing this place. Not going again neither recommend.
Pot Pourri,Sourabh Sen,27 February 2019,2,"Food is not good , we all came here for Team lunch in starter we only got 4 item but the taste of the starter is not good. So this place is not good for veg and non veg lover lovers. In sweets we have two ice cream flavours and rasgulla and kaddu ka kheer etc who will eat kaddu ka kheer"
Pot Pourri,Santosh Palivela,27 February 2019,4,"Best restuarent near DLF and nanakramaguda.
Quantity is good and quality is best.
For pure veggies kaju pulav and paneer pulav are best options and really enjoyable"
Pot Pourri,Narendra,26 February 2019,1,Toooooo spicy food upset my stomach also some chicken is uncooked I am sorry to say this but we suffered so I am being honest here there is no intention to harm
Pot Pourri,Saisaketh Guduru,25 February 2019,3,"Rating can be given only for place not for food.
Considering food I can give only 2 rating items are very cold gave rasam water as soup I can strongly say it is waste for vegitarians"
Pot Pourri,Sruti Kancharla,25 February 2019,3,"The staff here, is confused. First person tells us that paneer items won't be available and that it will take a minimum of 25 mins for any other thing we order and the other person assures us to get everything in 5-10 mins including paneer items.

But the food tasted pretty good.
We ordered few rotis with veg kofta curry
And Chilly garlic fried rice.

The ambience is pretty simple, it's one large seating area with different tables.

Food 4/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Staff 3/5"
Pot Pourri,Chaitanya Reddy,24 February 2019,3,"Paya is available but didn't meet my expectations ,
Ambience was good, staff were friendly , food was okay and gold privileges were there so it was an 2.5/5#"
Pot Pourri,Prathy,18 February 2019,4,"Ambience 4*
Food 4*
Staff 4*

Service is a bit slow, but the best part is they make sure you are attended for and take down the order as you asked for.
I went here for dinner today to celebrate my parents anniversary. My mother is never satisfied easily when it comes to food and picky, she said she liked the food. That was a huge shocker to me.
Both veg and non-veg are good.
We ordered Kheema pulav(to cover the taste buds of spice), Andhra Chicken Tikka, Veg Manchuria(omg awesome it was), Veg sheek kabab, Kadai paneer (tastier) and Butter Naans..

Loved the glasses they use to serve water

My over all rating 4*"
Pot Pourri,Ankur Sachdeva,17 February 2019,2,"Slow Service. Food's not upto the mark. This restaurant seems in love with sugar, they put it veggies and soup in bulk. Service staff was not courteous."
Pot Pourri,Lovely Sharma,17 February 2019,4,"We went to Pot Pourri . As usual like a very good restaurant , ambiance is really good. Although I am not very big fan of South Indian food. But hatts off to your chef food is really good.
We shall come back again."
Pot Pourri,Thirupathi Reddy,16 February 2019,5,Good place and wonderful ambience staff was very qujck and all are aware of zomato gold so no issue about that but pulav which we order was little bit dry!!
Pot Pourri,Benazeer Khan,15 February 2019,2,"Food: Extremely spicy. Noodles were made in Andhra style, were very spicy and had whole red chillies in it. There was hair in chicken.
Service: Bad, takes forever to bring food."
Pot Pourri,Madhava,15 February 2019,4,This place is very crowded on weekdays. They have authentic Andhra food. My favourite is pot pours kodi vepudu. I had thrice and every time I get great taste. Pulavs are also so tasty here. Must try place
Pot Pourri,Karthik Chowdary,13 February 2019,5,"Good to check in there
The dishes are best to there theme.
Which they have the best of cuisine for there variant of selection. Have a good team lunch.
Cheers team"
Pot Pourri,Jshriba,12 February 2019,5,"I ordered for curd rice, really very very good and lip smacking. The food is hygienic. Maintain the same quality. All the very best. I m marking this as one of my fav place."
Pot Pourri,Deepak Rajana,12 February 2019,5,Starters are very good. We went for normal eating not for buffet. We ordered Andhra dishes. Kaju kodi and Pot Pouri Kodi starters are spicy and tasty. Pandumirchi kodi pulav is good. The quality and quantity is real good. Ambience is also awesome. But AC is little less. Definitely worth for re-visit.
Pot Pourri,Dinesh,12 February 2019,5,"I and my partner had visited this place during their Valentine's Day Romantic Candle light dinner. This place has a great ambiance and is low lit with lovely candles. Ask for waiter 'Pappu', he did a great job by recommending us some authentic Andhra style dishes which were ideal and he makes us taste b4 serving to check if everything is ok which is commendable. We ordered Pot Pourri Kodi Vepudu , Pandumirchi Kodi Pulav nd Khubani ka mitta with Vanilla ice cream someone who has a sweet tooth should try this dessert which is a perfect marraige of great tastes."
Pot Pourri,Manpreet,11 February 2019,1,i visited this place last friday with my friends and we had ala carte. I don‚Äôt want to give any rating the service was very poor and slow there main focus was people having buffet. After waiting for 25 mins and lot of reminders we got our food. When the bill came they have added additional items which we didn‚Äôt had cost around 600 to the bill and my friends bad she didn‚Äôt checked the bill that time. So after this horrible experience i will suggest not to visit and id you are visting and having ala carte please cross check the bill before paying otherwise you can be the next victims of this thugs restaurant.
Pot Pourri,Alekhya,10 February 2019,5,"Quality was excellent
Ambience was good
Great service by pappu
Chicken lollipops was good
Chicken fry pulav was not up to mark
Dessert was really delicious
One should try it"
Pot Pourri,‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§∑‡•á‡§ï ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞,09 February 2019,4,This is a very good place. I am fond of patiala chicken here. Ambiance is very good and service is OK. One can try this place once. Location is also good.
Pot Pourri,Mohan Kr,08 February 2019,5,"Good portion sizes, quite tasty food, super quick service and got the right mix of cuisines in the menu. Everything just about right for your tum!"
Pot Pourri,Yogesh Jain,07 February 2019,1,"The worst experience that I had along with friends. The starters are good but the main course is completely tasteless. Even after informing the management about the taste, they were asking if salt or spice is more, but not about the overall quality & taste about the food. Very much disappointed that I took my friends for a treat here."
Pot Pourri,Anjanaa Karthik,05 February 2019,3,"Well, this restaurant looked really appealing and we wanted to try it very badly! So we ordered a lot. Veg and non veg dishes. The best was were the chinese starters. Honey chilli potato was amazing. The shangai veg was also good. Non veg starters were not that great though. And we ordered naan and kadai paneer. There was absolutely no salt and the paneer was really hard. Biriyani was really good and the schezuan rice not good either. I think they added coconut oil to it. I'm really not a big fan of coconut oil. Can visit once.
Ambience : 3.5
Food : 3
Service : 4
Cleanliness :4.5"
Pot Pourri,NagaChandra Immadisetty,04 February 2019,1,Worst biryani and worst serving experience ... Except 3 starters remaining items are very bad... Totally worth less food and time waste .. disappointed
Pot Pourri,Rakesh Pillai,03 February 2019,4,"This place has nice ambience and is very clean and hygienic.
Wat was good?
- chicken+kaju starter
- babycorn munchuria

What i didn't like:
- The chicken biryani was not upto the mark, the taste could definitely improve.

The staff was very polite and quick to respond..!! I appreciate their behavior."
Pot Pourri,BALLA ANILKUMAR,02 February 2019,4,"Very tasty food with reasonable price and great service ,drinks also available very nice place to spend some time to your friends and families with lavish dishes"
Pot Pourri,Yum Yum YUMMY !,31 January 2019,4,"Its a good place to hangout with friends. The building itself seems busy everyday. Crowded place. Food was tasty . Worth the money. Service was too good

Will visit again"
Pot Pourri,Shrikanth Reddy Aenugu,30 January 2019,4,"The ambience was good .

I would expect a faster service and the the staff should be attentive to customers rather than to themselves.

I would be a 2 star to the staff

Food is good not that great"
Pot Pourri,Purna Chandra,30 January 2019,1,"I thought of giving ZERO, but there is no option instead I am giving it as 1. Very worst restaurant i ever visited for Buffet. 

If anybody is planning to go for it especially for Non-Veg, I suggest please dont waste your money.

No.of varieties and even the taste is very bad. Coming to the service NO WORDS. They will make us to go for Main Course even though we are not done with starters."
Pot Pourri,Sandeep Kumar,30 January 2019,1,Non veg is worst. Ambience and service is also worst. Taste is bland. You can easily avoid this restaurant. They take so much time to serve food and even they are not polite
Pot Pourri,Sowmya Krishna,28 January 2019,3,"Food: 3.5/5
We have ordered
veg manchow soup- it's GOOD
Panner majestic - it was more sour and tangy in taste.
Nijam handi recommended by waiter- it was okay
Panner kulcha - its more salty may be because of butter
Kothimeera butter roti - this one is good and light.

Ambiance:3/5 is alright.
Service :5/5 it was GOOOODD (papu served us)"
Pot Pourri,Aman Katoch,28 January 2019,5,Great place to have a good dining experience. Had breakfast and dinner here. Food was awesome and was surprised to provide us complimentary breakfast for all the customers on that particular day.
Pot Pourri,Shiva Kumar,27 January 2019,4,One can try the buffet and the best thing I can experience here is the kodi pulav ..which tastes very good and also in deserve one can try gajar halwa
Pot Pourri,Chirag Kothari,26 January 2019,5,Excellent taste and awesome food. Chicken tikka was perfect in all the ways. Its good for veg and non veg food. Places is nice with good ambience.
Pot Pourri,Bondugula Dilip Kumar,26 January 2019,4,One of the best restaurant to visit and have freaky chat with friends.Good ambiance and good place for corporate team lunch.Very well established place to dine in.
Pot Pourri,Sonali Singh,25 January 2019,5,"The food was very good. Also, the service provided by one of the waiters Papu was really really nice. He is very kind and polite. Keep up the good work young boy!!!!"
Pot Pourri,Sai Krishna Chintala,25 January 2019,4,Very good restaurant. Food tastes good and spicy. Disappointing thing is buffet cost has been increased. Ambience is little bit conjusted on fridays.
Pot Pourri,Anusha Sinha,24 January 2019,4,"The service was lovely.
The food I ordered were:
Chilly prawns,
Butter naan,
Mutton Rogan Josh

All the items were good, but mutton Rogan Josh was kind of very heavy and buttery. So that can be improved.

Overall experience: very good"
Pot Pourri,Suresh,23 January 2019,4,"Nice place with decent interior and delicious food.
It's a hygenic place and the food is made of quality ingredients.
I like chicken biryani and crispy corn here.
If you want to try, they have some spicy options too. But be prepared, I eat a lot of spicy food, even I got tears."
Pot Pourri,Srikanth T,22 January 2019,1,"We went for dinner based on this 4.0 rating it did not meet bare minimum criteria. Food was over spicey/hot even after mentioning the spice levels in first course. Service was very bad. They asked how the soup/paya was and when we mentioned that it is too spicey , that was not bothered and next course was even more spicey/hot. I generally am ok with hot/spicey food but this is very extreme. I would not recommend going to this place."
Pot Pourri,Narendra Talakokkula,22 January 2019,1,I personally a lazy person who don‚Äôt give a regular review but my taste buds made me to write this review. The only thing that worth was ambience.
Pot Pourri,Venkatesh Aala,22 January 2019,3,Ambience and service is good. Locality of the restaurant is good. But taste of the food is not up to the mark. Can make it more better. Should improve the taste of their signature dishes
Pot Pourri,SATYA RAVI CHANDRA,20 January 2019,5,Server(sushanth)is very friendly and polite. He suggests each and everything with patience.His service is also very good. Finally made this restaurant my regular place
Pot Pourri,Solomon Dcruz,19 January 2019,3,"We had been there for the lunch and the Food was Good but there were only few dishes in the buffet so unhappy with it.
Ambiance was Preety good. Needs to improve their service little"
Pot Pourri,Rakesh Bandiwar,17 January 2019,4,"Amazing place to have south Indian cuisine.
Good service, This restaurant offers ala arte and buffet both . we tried Natu kodi pulav and gongura mamsam
Both taste good, Good ambiance , good place to visit.."
Pot Pourri,Aishwariya Kawaii,14 January 2019,5,"Our usual hangout place. Every time we think of eating out, we always end up at this place. Great staff, delicious food and calm ambience. Chicken drumsticks and Veg pulav are a must try."
Pot Pourri,Saketh Goundagouni,11 January 2019,4,"I was there with my friends yesterday for dinner. We were served by Papu, he did great service. We ordered all south Indian dishes, each of them were tasty."
Pot Pourri,Tasty Hyderabad,10 January 2019,3,"This place was in my bucket list since a very long time and my visit to this place is very random. I really liked the traditional ambience. The decor of the place is good. The service was very slow and the staff i felt were little confused.
So, pot pourri please look into that.
And about the food, we ordered Chilli egg, Pandumirchi royyala vepudu, Mamsam pulao, Nellore chepala pulusu with Tandoori naan. The quantity of the food was really good and the food was not different from home food."
Pot Pourri,Sai Chaitanya,08 January 2019,3,"We were there with so much hunger. At a speed start we have ordered ‚ÄúMiriyala Natukodi vepudu‚Äù and ‚ÄúMamsam Pulav‚Äù. Miriyala Natukodi vepudu was ok! But quantity was pretty good. Mamsam pulav was very good to taste and the spiciness was perfect and quantity was very high. I felt oil is high in both orderes.

Ambience was ok! And service was not so fast!"
Pista House,Moonis Ahmed,24 May 2019,4,"Living in Manikonda, this has been our go-to place for good mughlai food. If you want authentic Hyderabadi biryani, then this should be a default option. 

Have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. 

The chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.

We tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem. 

Avoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.

Food - 5/5
Value for money - 4/5
Packaging - 4/5"
Pista House,Prasun Paul,22 May 2019,4,"This place was recommended by people for some good Haleem, and that's the reason we paid this place a visit. We ordered two dishes of Haleem and two full plates and one regular plate of Chicken Biryani.

The Haleem was very well prepared and had the aroma and taste. It was delicious! The servings of Biryani was overwhelming and very filling. The regular serving was more than one normal person could eat. But the taste was average and nothing new. The chicken was cooked well.

The ambience was good but a little too full. There's no default seating for groups of more than four people, and as we were a group of five, we had to rearrange a few chairs. The service was prompt but, understandably, very busy."
Pista House,Minerva Mohapatra,21 May 2019,4,"Midnight Craving.If you are in Hyderabad & that too in the month of Ramzan, then Haleem is a must try.It has a very rich & aromatic taste which is more than enough for 2 people."
Pista House,G. LAKSHMI JAHNAVI,15 May 2019,3,Please include vegetable haleem in menu to order as it is only available in pista house. We can say the best vegatable haleem is available here and served hot.
Pista House,SAI SURAKSHITH KESHAVA,15 May 2019,5,"The best haleem in the city, mouth watering tummy satisfying dish... Eid is not fullfilled without eating this haleem... I am very happy to suggest pista house to the food lovers in the city who have not yet tried"
Pista House,Regnis Bhuvna,14 May 2019,3,"""Haleem Haleem Haleem""

Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.

I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.

I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!

Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.

üëâüëâIt's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)

Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.

Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.

I Will Still Give It A Try In Other Branches Of Pista House & Will Let You Know The Reviews."
Pista House,Jitendra Kumar Agarwala,01 May 2019,4,Tried ‚ÄòPathar ka Ghost‚Äô and loved it. This place is famous for Haleem which I am yet to try. Tried a couple of Chinese items as well and loved them. All-in-all a very reputed and reliable place to dine-in
Pista House,Rajeswari PS,30 April 2019,5,Delicious foodüëçüëå..i had good experience with this food..i liked a lot..next time i will definitely choos swagath grand but expected dessert along with veg biryani.
Pista House,Sujoy Deb,30 April 2019,4,"This place known for its haleem, every year i go there and taste it-love their haleem and also their hyderabadi sweets like kubani ka meeta..."
Pista House,Nalin Francis,28 April 2019,1,Yesterday bought Rogan josh from here one of the worst rogan josh curry ever. I do not recommend this restaurant. I have tried biryani from here it was ok. Big name bad service.
Pista House,Foodbug,18 April 2019,4,Well... Had to eat veg all the time I have visited this place since my wife is vegetarian but believe me restaurant famous for haleem also makes veg items delicious..
Pista House,Habeeb,13 April 2019,1,Attitude problem right from reception/accounts person whoever he is.Burnt food given twice nobdy cares.Take bills shamelessly not even asking why food left as it is without being eaten.
Pista House,Rahul Nkoda,01 April 2019,1,"If there could be an option of zero stars, I would definitely put it. It's a very bad experience ordering from pista house. The food is good, but service is very slow, pathetic and bad. The managers and people managing speak blatant lies over calls for a order on swiggy.
They constantly make the delivery guy wait with false words to both the customers and the delivery partner.
If running a hotel business is so difficult, maybe a change in management would help. Completely ruining the name and brand of pista house."
Pista House,Ayesha Tabassum,31 March 2019,5,Best place to hangout.... reasonable and tasty.with proper hygienic.... the one of the best place in hyderabad ...the staff is where humble and polite
Pista House,Abhay,20 March 2019,1,"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant today and had a real bad experience and was really embarrassed as I suggested this restaurant for dinner with family and friends. We had to wait for almost an hour for the placed ordered to be served. At the end, we were not billed for the items we placed order for and the bill was for extra items. It took around 15 mins for the corrected bill with two times to and fro."
Pista House,Namrata Sain,18 March 2019,3,"Went twice, they have nice decent Ambience. Their mutton galouti kebab is good. But they overcook it sometimes. The achari chicken was good, but the biriyani was too spicy. The butter chicken was sweet and spicy served with perfect butter naan. No complains about the quantity. The quality of the food can be improved."
Pista House,Sreekanth NK,17 March 2019,4,"I haven‚Äôt visited this place. Ordered online from here.
Try 1. Schezwan chicken üçó fried rice üçö. It was delicious ü§§. Good amount of chicken pieces were there. It will be more than enough for two. It was really hot ü•µ üå∂üå∂üå∂. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Try 2. Chicken üçó tikka masala. This was good too. It had very good thick gravy. Will be just sufficient for two. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

3. Service: yet to visit"
Pista House,Rajit Sarma,16 March 2019,4,One of our favourite places for hangout. The biryani is mildly spicy and not very oily which we really appreciate. Kababs are great too. Isnt very heavy on your wallet so we normally visit this place one every week when office's food vendor provides less than average food.
Pista House,Amit Dang,08 March 2019,2,"Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped."
Pista House,Indradipta Sardar,01 March 2019,5,Pista house is the restaurant which comes in mind when it comes to Biriyani and Haleen. But I tried Chinese here and I must say the dishes tasted too good. A very decent restaurant with reasonable price.
Pista House,Sahil Bhat,20 February 2019,4,"Went with my office team for lunch. The wait time was almost 20 mins, so better call them up beforehand if you are a corporate team.

Coming to price and taste, it is worth the money with quantity and taste both satisfying the money!"
Pista House,Sameera Sam,19 February 2019,5,"Best best best biryani and chicken 65
Chicken 65 has a good amount of gravy one alone can finish it too..
Quality - 5/5
Quantity - 4.5/5
Taste - 5/5"
Pista House,Priyanka Priyadarshini,16 February 2019,4,The best biriyani I had ever had.I am in love with their biriyani.And the amount they serve is awesome.The preparation of food is so good.The quality is also goid.I would recommend you to have biriyani from this place.
Pista House,Sajal M,15 February 2019,4,"This place is an amazing experience to refresh your taste buds. Mostly serves cakes pieces, snacks and juices/shakes, etc. but never fails to amaze you. It has good seating space and the staff seems to be courteous and does explain you in case of any questions and confusions. They even serve eggless products for the vegetarians. The place is located on the old Mumbai Highway and is a little ahead opposite of the Care hospitals in the area. The restaurant has decent parking space as well."
Pista House,Anvesh Chowdary,14 February 2019,4,"Tried the zafrani 65 biryani and then butter chicken along with rumali roti. 

The food is good and perfect in taste with the price is killer and good ambience."
Pista House,Kamelia Roy,12 February 2019,4,"This is an amazing place serving authentic Hyderabadi delicacies.
The quantity of the biriyani is amazing and the taste is mouthwatering. The galauti kebab and the seekh kebabs were magnificent. I even brought the biriyani to Calcutta while traveling. Definitely Worth visiting!!"
Pista House,Shivi Saxena,30 January 2019,4,"Went to have dinner here on a Tuesday. The waiting line outside the restaurant did give a glimpse of the amazing food they serve.
Since it was just the two of us, we bypassed the line and got a seat right away.
We ordered some garlic naan and Schezwan chicken, the service was very quick and food was great."
Pista House,Nitin Bhapkar,25 January 2019,1,"Disappointment..being one of the famous restaurant chain, had lot of expectations.We were made to seat on table with dirty table mats and plates.. Food quality is worst to the core. Ordered Mutton Rogan Josh which had excess amount of salt, to our suprise staff was least bothered to act on it or accept feedback. Didn't have biryanis available hence had to sacrifice with steamed rice and dal.
Would not recommend this restaurant as needs huge improvement in terms of food quality, service and hygiene standards"
Pista House,Sushovan Chanda,15 January 2019,5,Absolutely amazing. Had a great dinner with biriyani and kebab. Friendly stuffs used to take care of their customers as much as they can. Nice
Pista House,Ganesh Ravi,13 January 2019,5,"A restaurant to always rely on. This restaurant use to be my default choice whenever I wanted to eat out and don't feel like searching for anew place. Great quality food and good service! Their haleem was very nice too, though it was a bit sweet for my taste (it is suppose to be mildly sweet anyway, so it's not their fault). The location was also perfect for me"
Pista House,Mrinal Chakroborty,11 January 2019,4,"After a day long review we crashed at the gates of Pista House, Hyderabad

We started with Chicken Tandoor which was well cooked and tasty

We moved on to have signature Patthar ke Ghosht , it was soft and outstanding - what a product

Then we concentrated on Mutton Kachhi Biriyani, it honoured its fame

Great service n nice ambience

We had ended up with lovely kheer

Cheers"
Pista House,Rakshitha Meghna D,25 December 2018,4,"A very small place with a lot of varieties.
Worth dining here.
Zaffrani tangdi chicken was good.
Went here thrice and was satisfied everytime"
Pista House,Vijay,24 December 2018,5,Superb tandoori chicken. Mint chutney is awesome. Got free Goli soda as well with food order. Loved the food quality and quantity and taste.
Pista House,Akella Surya Chaitanya,19 December 2018,1,There is a lot of difference between the nizampet and this (Gachibowli) branch.. Too late at serving.. Quality is too poor.. Staff doesn't respond quickly
Pista House,Sunita Mandal,10 December 2018,3,"Food is OK OK. Special Chicken Biriyani was the only good item. Tandoori roti was burnt, after we asked for replacement, we got slightly uncooked one. I wouldn't suggest this place for north Indian cusine.
Ambience is average.
There are mosquitoes & not very clean.
Service time is quick."
Pista House,Akhil Mahajan,04 December 2018,4,"This review is for delivery. We ordered a half kg butterscotch cake. It was really really great in taste. The texture of the cake with perfect amount of butterscotch made it more special.

Edited review- we finally went to the outlet. As soon as we entered the food fragrance got us. We ordered some snavks and they were good"
Pista House,SRK üòçüëåüç∏üçªüçæü¶Ä,30 November 2018,4,Yesterday we had a dinner at this place the food was good much taste we ordered kebab. Chicken biryani and thum up the service was late but good we enjoyed
Pista House,Ghosh.Monica,29 November 2018,4,"We orderd banjara kebab which was extremely soft, juicy and outstandingly tasty.full marks to this starter that melts in the mouth.This was followed by Zafrani murg Biryani which tasted good but not out of the way tasty.Both dishes were moderately spiced and i am happy about it. Great value for money and good service."
Pista House,Ganesh Suriyanarayanan,20 November 2018,2,"Went there for lunch with friends, and not a good dining experience.
1.  Ambience - not like a Fine Dine restaurant - more a quick eatery / Cafeteria place
2.  Service  : Ok.  the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served, it is good to be prepared
3.  Food : OK to Pathetic.  we had some starters Paneer Tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had Tandoori Prawns their Opinion was not so good.  After the starters the Disaster came in the name of EGG Biriyani.  We had ordered for 2 Egg biriyani,  there was no Flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with Fried Boiled Eggs. See the Photo.  It didnt end here, we gave a feedback the Waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it, and came back and served with masala which was Chicken pieces. Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.  

We ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

Overall not a good experience and dont want to go there again."
Pista House,Ceejay,18 November 2018,4,"Been there for a Biryani and they serve better food than any other outlet , Far more better Biryani then other famous Biryani in Hyderabad #Pistahouse for best service . Over all I would keep ordering and would trust pista house brand when it comes to quality food"
Pista House,Girish Reddy,16 November 2018,1,"Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital.

Ambiance

This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels. The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

Food quality

We ordered three items

1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot

2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff. People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues. This outlet is making a fast buck in the Hitech area where floating population is heavy."
Pista House,Silka Das,05 November 2018,4,"Ordered 1 Zafrani Chicken Biryani and 1 malai kebabs. Both the items were very good. Quantity was enough for 3 people , delivery was quick. Bottom line is we had a simple and lovely lunch. Thanks !üëç"
Pista House,Varun Raj,31 October 2018,1,Worst service. Strictly nor recommended for family and decent people. Taste is below average. BIG NO for this place.. Stay away. Worst service ever
Pista House,Oindrila Rahaman,22 October 2018,4,"This place was recommended by a local friend after learning that I do not favor spicy biriyani. And I was thinking about trying hyderabadi biryani once again before I leave. Yes pista house lived up the expectation. Good packaging, prompt delivery, good taste.."
Pista House,Sai Ravali G,18 October 2018,3,"Had ordered almond cake from pista house.
It was not much fresh but tastes okay.
Over all seemed like they have not delivered fresh cake as I saw water was also coming from the cake.
Hope so that from the next time they deliver fresh cakes"
Pista House,Joydeep Barman,17 October 2018,3,Tried zafrani chicken biryani... Ordered it for home delivery. Its was ok. Not that uch special. Half egg was an addition. Still the taste is just ok
Pista House,I Am Bhukkad || Krishnendu,14 October 2018,2,"Went there a week ago. The foods were average i will rate the food a 3 out of 5!

Now come to the service - We ordered 3 butter chicken but they gave us 1, so had to wait for another 15-20mins to get the other butter chicken (please do not compare the taste of butter chicken if youre from north India)

The restaurant looks good from the outside, but inside House Flies will accompany you with your food and friends.."
Pista House,Samar Sardar,12 October 2018,4,Had a nice evening there yesterday. Food was decent. Biryani was good but little dry. Need to improve little more. Ambience was good. Staffs are friendly
Pista House,Food Nawabs,08 October 2018,4,"An amazing pocket friendly place where they serve confectionery, cakes, Juices, now in this Branch they are even serving Food.. what more can you ask from a big chain of outlets. Pista House has always been a wonderful place to serve your small hunger, but Gachibowli can address any thing that is big and small. a big thumbs up for.them for Gachibowli....."
Pista House,Aijazmohammed1,08 October 2018,5,"Out with family for dinner excellent food with exceptional service, plenty of choices very good quality and quantity definitely will visit again."
Pista House,Mohammed Abdul Qader,08 October 2018,5,"Went for the dinner with the family. All the items were delicious. You must try the firni in deserts.
Dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters."
Pista House,Kumar Swamy,06 October 2018,1,Worst Experience in Parcel of Zaffron Motton Regular Biryani no mutton piecec found i. Biryani bill is 158/- with Gst ... Fooling public in parcel.. dont take pacel frm pista house ... Very Bad experience Simply Looting Public money on parcels of biryani......
Pista House,Pavan.cherry5,05 October 2018,1,"Worst quality and more oily. Rice quantity is less and pices are more.

Rice quality is also not good. Fully desi pointed .

I won‚Äôt refer to anyone"
Pista House,Chandana Paladagu,03 October 2018,1,Worst service....i dont know y they have such a stupid attitude towards customers..they r not ready to accept the mistakes they do.food taste is also below average....not again to gachibowli pistha house...
Pista House,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),02 October 2018,4,"When it comes to have some veg or non veg main course Pista House is always on the top of my lists. Starting from spicy achari murgh afgani to the delicious veggy Nawabi handi with perfect balance of cashwer nuts all are just too good. Even their kaddu ki kheer in dessert and chicken biriyani are also worth mentioning.

Pista House,Sind Hu,02 October 2018,3,"Cakes were really good and tasty in Pista House. Though the models are quiet simple and normal, flavors were really good. Loved the Mango flavor cake."
Pista House,Jithendra Babu Anumolu,01 October 2018,1,one of the best worst place...biryani is too worst...but their strtegy is too good...they dont have AC but if we sit and eat the price is double..irresponsible serice...better to go to almas r biryanis...good bye..will never visit again
Pista House,Saibhargavpraveent,30 September 2018,1,"Giving this 1 rating for this restaurant is also not needed but giving as it is minimum

we have ordered tangdi kabab and biryani. while ordering we were not informed about the time it is going to take but it took 40 mins. Then we got tangdi kabab with foul smell, after fighting with management we got other plate and it not satisfying. Also same with chicken biryani it is the worst biryani I had in my life till now.

I will not recommend anyone to this place.

PS : First time I am giving negative feedback on any restaurant"
Pista House,Haribabu Sankatala,28 September 2018,1,Shitty place... Shitty service... Shitty management... Not again... Not always brand will work.. Think twice before u check in.. Wrost place in recent times.
Pista House,Pankaj Pawar,28 September 2018,4,"Ambiance: 4/5. Nice and clean place
Service: 4/5. Nice and Quick service

Food:  Chicken Afgani was awesome. Chicken pieces were cooked really well and curry was yummy. Chicken 65 Biryani is a bit unique and we really liked the taste."
Pista House,Rajesh Reddy,28 September 2018,1,"In my life the worst exp.. i had as a foody lover. Dont know what quality of basmathi rice they r mixing for biryani i think 30rs 40rs rice itseems
The price of all items is very high..and service is too bad. The food path 50rs biryani is better than pista house.. Chii chii.. I think gachibowli brand is not original. Dear managment plz check with the quality of food and employees"
Pista House,Venkatesh Mudiraj,28 September 2018,1,Waste food.. Ordered zafrani biryani. Its very cool think before night food.. No AC and the prices are too high for tat quality..no proper service. overall worst exprnc. Think its duplicate pista house restrnt.. They r making bad remark on brand..
Pista House,Eswar V,28 September 2018,1,Biryani is worst....No A/C...But the prices are the same like a big restaurant...No proper service..owner is irresponsible..They make customers fools with their behavior..most of the ratings might be created ratings as I have seen 80 percent dissatisfaction from the customers..will never visit it again in my life.Their was no ZERO rating so giving 1 rating..My friends and colleagues told me similar response but I wanted to try as it is a big brand.. finally paid for not listening to them.
Pista House,Inner World Of A Super Foodie,22 September 2018,4,"A very famous place in Hyderabad which previously used to sell only haleem but now it sells a hell lot of thing and the best part is that they sell a delicacy that is Special Biriyani which consists of mutton, chicken, fish and yes it will be tough for even 3 people to complete it...
We'll try the Barkas Pathar Ghost as well
Service-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Food-5/5"
Pista House,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),22 September 2018,4,"Good food with reasonable prices-
Ambiance-
Pista House has a long chain of restaurants in Hyderabad. This outlet is located in Gachibowli near South India Shopping Mall. Pista House is bakery and restaurant having a large number of take away products available. Ambiance is quite congested because they have restaurant in the central area of hall surrounded by bakery. Also they have separate party hall available for advanced reservation.
Food-
Pista house is mostly famous for it's bakery products. Also in time of Ramzan, they serve Haleem. Pista House serves Indian as well as continental food including Chinese, Italian. We ordered Chicken burger served with potato chips and ketchup, garlic bread, chicken tangdi kebab, angara kebab and Chicken Biryani. Both the kebabs were good in taste and quantity. All other food items were very good in taste including Chicken Biryani. They serve Zafrani Chicken Biryani.
Service-
Service was average but the staff was polite."
Pista House,Shashank Gujarathi,22 September 2018,2,"Flies in lime soda
Fish with foul smelling
Chicken lollipop half cooked
Prawns were rubbery
Don't go for sea food at this place
Only better item we had was biryani
Lot of expectations were disappointed"
Pista House,Ankita Mittal,17 September 2018,5,"Packed chicken biryani and took it all the way to Kolkata. They loved it . Great quantity and taste
It was very well packed too. I had no difficulty in taking it so far."
Pista House,Deepa Pinto,16 September 2018,3,U went here as i heard their haleem was great. But unfortunately they serve haleem only during ramzan. This place is great for kebabs. Biriyani is great too. The portion size is quite huge.
Pista House,PK,11 September 2018,4,Ordered fried chicken biryani. It was awesome and it‚Äôs very lite . Loved the biryani . Even had faluda it is also yummy . Can have different cakes shakes in pista house . 100% suggested .
Pista House,Pavan Kumar,10 September 2018,3,"Happy to have Pista House set up a branch in cyberabad, the choice of food here is fantastic with a wide array of desserts,snacks and shakes for people to order.
I personally love their salads(Chicken, tuna) as they are done with fresh ingredients and served well.
They need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.
Another important concern is the pricing the price of items is different at different outlets, the same stuff at tolichowki is cheaper compared to the Gachibowli branch."
Pista House,Mandar Deshmukh,06 September 2018,5,"one of the best achari mutton. soft and properly marinated meat. the spices were properly grinded and cooked. the aroma of the food was so mesmerising that after a point we forgot to click the pics. zafrani mutton biryani here is a must for all the connoisseurs of good food. while other biryani joints also pretty good, but Pista House has a distinct place in Hyderabadi food map. the sitafal sweet suggest by our captain was awesome. staff was good especially Shahrukh with his distinct serving style. also bone soup is a must try."
Pista House,Mukesh Mittal,30 August 2018,3,Been here. Food is average. Causal dining. For me all biryanis are same. So nothing special. Average ambience. Average service but little crowded.
Pista House,Narayana,17 August 2018,2,"Mutton biryani is taste less you even don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a biryani,not at all tasty
Biryani lovers plz don‚Äôt order especially mutton biryani
We ordered chicken tikka it‚Äôs good"
Pista House,Hemanth Emadabathuni,16 August 2018,5,"A little heaven for food lovers, all the items tasted really good. The major perk of this place is their menu is too pocket friendly. The best hangout place, must visit."
Pista House,Jefrey,15 August 2018,1,The service is hopeless. They won't even serve water for the costumers unless you ask them. And the manager is also helpless and rude if the costumers complaint. First and last visit to this restaurant !
Pista House,Shahbaz Shah,15 August 2018,1,absolutely worthless service. extremely bad attitude from the staff and even the manager is very poor and rude in his approach towards the customers... last visit to the place
Pista House,Madhumita,13 August 2018,2,"Taste wise they are OK, but I don‚Äôt trust their hygiene. Had ordered through Swiggy and were disappointed with the quality of food. Chicken lollipop was undercooked. There was red blood inside the chicken pieces and had to pull to tear the chicken."
Pista House,Dhruv Gupta,12 August 2018,5,"This place serves the best Chicken and Mutton Biryaani in entire Hyderabad. I always go back to Pista house for my biryaani cravings.
Must try once."
Pista House,Indrani,12 August 2018,3,Nice ambience and the food was upto the mark... Looking up for more visits to this place ... Sunday trifle was great... We had biriyani and chicken nawabi... Biriyani was of much good quantity...n nawabi chicken was a bit spicy .
Pista House,Gourmet Hunter,08 August 2018,4,"Apart from its good quality Haleem, what also stands out is their Chicken Burger. I love the taste and the generous size of the burger bun.
We usually eat Chicken burger from this place and the taste never disappoints.
Chicken burger is stuffed with minced meat, few veggies like tomatoes and nice white sauce.

Haleem of course is the one we try during festive season. Overall its a good bakery for snacks & cakes."
Pista House,Piyush Das,03 August 2018,1,"I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )
 
My order details -

Through Swiggy Order No: #16352555425
, 2 portions of supposed to be Kheema Biriyani .

NO Thanks for ruining the Friday lunch experience."
Pista House,Ravikanth Laxmana,28 July 2018,3,Decent place. Try this place for Hyderabadi biryani. Very close to the prominent places. Parking is an issue though. Avoid during peak hours.
Pista House,Aishvarya Arora,28 July 2018,3,"Heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home. So I finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself. (High Expectations)

The place was nowhere near what I had imagined. The restaurant wasn't a very neat and hygienic place, the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty. The people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in.
Moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places. The desserts looked sumptuous (even though I was full for them, I manged to take some pictures of them)

So from now on I am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if I go there, it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts!"
Pista House,Bhushan Gaonkar,27 July 2018,5,"Amazing food was much better then expected. As it was just a pit stop while passing by .
Service guy Mr Raj was too helpful with suggestions .
Worth the visit if your in Hyderabad."
Pista House,Aditya K.s.,25 July 2018,5,Raj was very polite and the service is good keep doing it keep it up..all the best of luck to you continue the same stay motivated and continue the same.
Pista House,Shivani Parikh,22 July 2018,1,Very bad service and not that great food. No proper behavior from the staff members. Very poor service. Even the taste of the food was really bad. Nothing great.
Pista House,Ria@ Travelfoodism.com,15 July 2018,3,"Pista house‚Äôs haleem is what I look forward to always. On a vacation to Nizam‚Äôs Hyderabad, we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose:

Dum ka Murg & Tandoori roti.

A little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience. Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you. No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt. They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace.

Next will try their haleem and some desserts too."
Pista House,Natasha Qureshi,15 July 2018,4,"Need to improve a lot on ambience. Whether it‚Äôs Pathar ka ghost or any other mutton recipe, it‚Äôs simply very good. Servers are not very well trained but surely very polite. Pricing is what anyone just so look for."
Pista House,Tanvi Naik/ Taste.a.licious,13 July 2018,5,"Out of many outlets in Hyderabad, I was waiting to try one soo I Ordered from the one in gachibowli.
I tried 2 biryani's from this outlet chiken and mutton... Amazing biryani , full filing quantity and delightful taste .."
Pista House,Raghu,04 July 2018,3,"Pista house, known for Haleem in the month of Ramzan.
Orders Haleem from Swiggy,
Tastes good.
Deliver was quick and
the haleem is hot as well.

Overall ok."
Pista House,Pooja Singh,02 July 2018,4,This place Never fails to amaze me! Food here is amazing but a little spicy( in case you don't like spicy food) . Haleem is a hit and all non vegetarian delicacies are brilliant.
Pista House,|| Viharika Rathode ||,28 June 2018,3,"Had their Reshmi kebab served with omlette on the top it was good
ginger prawns were oky but their serving quantity was good.
Chicken biryani and haleem was good as usual ."
Pista House,Nikitha Rao,27 June 2018,5,"I had visited this place with my foodie gang.

I loved thier Hyderabadi starters
Malai kebab was the best, it was so finger licking , soft and delicious.
Pathar ka ghost and tai Pai chicken was juicy and tender.
Thier haleem is the most best thing in town. And it's one of my favorite.
Coming to thier biryani, no doubt it's been always good.
Coming to sweets double ka meeta mango Malai was the best.
Highly recommended place."
Pista House,Rameez Siddiqui,25 June 2018,5,"Visited this place a week ago with my foodie friends! They had perfect hyderabadi starters which tasted awesome!
The malai kebab, patthar ka gosht, tai pei chicken were my personal favorites!
We Also had Butter chicken and butter naan! The taste was just right! Not so spicy at all
Their biryani is famous so no doubt the biryani was exquisite!
Service was on point! And the sweets were too yumm.. The double ka meetha and mango malai are the best among them!
Highly recommend this place! For family and friends!"
Pista House,Foodie,24 June 2018,1,"My experience was bad here, they kept us waiting for 20 mins and told that the order we placed for biryani is unavailable.
Same for the sweetdish we ordered."
Pista House,Shagun Arora,24 June 2018,4,the top layer of the cake was of homey was not that good
Pista House,Sumeeth Nama,20 June 2018,5,"Every year I desparately wait to try their Haleem during Ramadan season.
Always knew about their Haleem and was surprised to taste their mughai range.

The food was delicious and quite easy on pockets. The place is divided into two sections, inside there is a private eating space good for families.

The quality and quantity of the food was satisfying.

The dessert range in the bakery section was yummy and delicious.

The staff was friendly and super-fast.

You definitely can try this one when you‚Äôre around this area be it for a quite bite or proper spread."
Pista House,Shree,20 June 2018,4,Tried their Chicken Biryani and Haleem. It was great in taste. Place is quite rushy so you have to wait in queue to get the seat. Ambience is not so fancy but you won't regret after going. Food was great as well as staffs are good.
Pista House,Ayeshaa Syed,19 June 2018,4,"Pista house needs no introduction. Their Haleem has always been the talk of the town.

I was here for dinner with friends during Ramadan to try their Haleem and gorge on some Mughlai delicacies they offer.

When I entered the place it was packed with people in queue waiting to be seated.

Coming to the food, I totally loved their Malai Chicken and Pathar ka gosht. Juicy and tender. Their Haleem was yummy too.  I ended up trying their bakery section and wasn't disappointed either.
The desserts like dry fruit kheer and mulberry cream bowl was amazing and we had party in our mouths.

However, there's definitely room for improvement in the hospitality front and this will a big hit with families.
Good food & quantity, along with great prices is a steal deal combination and would definitely be here soon."
Pista House,Ris Hi,15 June 2018,1,Visited this place on ramadan and we ordered 6 haleem we where 4 all we thought that we can enjoy the real taste of haleem and the bitter truth was the taste was long gone with the moving season .. seriously there is something wrong with this branch too many uncooked bones and intestines . All I can just say is ONE BAD TASTE IS ENOUGH to make all the good once bad ..
Marsala Food Company,Alisha Das,23 May 2019,4,"Went to this place on a weekday. Then also I found this place having a crowd. This is a perfect family and friends restaurant.
The quantity of this restaurant is very nice and fulfilling. This place is good for people considering less spicy option. There are variety of dishes available here.

I ordered pahadi chicken in starter. It had this taste of spinach and it tasted good with mint chutney otherwise quite bland. But the chicken was cooked properly.
I ordered special chicken curry in main course. That was bits of small chicken in rich gravy. It was good not very awesome.
Ambience was decent.

Can explore once."
Marsala Food Company,Rajesh Kumar Sinha,17 May 2019,4,Very friendly staff... Good service... I went for Mandi but even buffet was looking nice. Good and different taste of Mandi as well. #ArabianRestaurant

Marsala Food Company,Aditya SAlunkhe,08 May 2019,4,"Good food...
Nice ambience...
Service is okay.....
Not many varieties in veg curries but whatever they have is good in taste....
Overall a nice restaurant to have dinner with your friends or family."
Marsala Food Company,Trupti Dhongdi,08 May 2019,5,"Chicken hariyali kabab the best kebab served in Hyderabad
I have no words to say this chicken hariyali kabab has broken all the standards of taste yummiest kabab ever had"
Marsala Food Company,Surbhi Jain,06 May 2019,4,"If you are looking for North Indian food, i must say i liked it alot. Ambience is good, service is good, a regular place or a go to place i would say. I do not know how i missed this place. We tried schezwan fried rice, kadai paneer and roti. My friends and i plan to try the buffet there next time. 4.5 from my side. ‚ù§üòä"
Marsala Food Company,Praveen Kumar,05 May 2019,5,"First time I have tried Arabian chicken soup , I feel a different taste which really exited me to have one more.
And also I ordered the fish haryali tikka , the quantity and quality of the food really gReat. Finally I tried the marsala special chicken by Having little drops of lemon juice the taste is outstanding.
The small concern is the naan edges are bit thick. And remaining All others are great."
Marsala Food Company,Mubeena Afreen,05 May 2019,4,"Visited for lunch today. The food was so yummy and the ambience was very good.
Must try dish is non-veg Chinese platter in which we get fish, prawns, chicken drumsticks and other 2 types of chicken also. It costs around 800/- but it is definitely very much worthy. And the butter naan was so soft n nice. And the assorted chicken Mandi was also yummy.
Overall it is one of the best restaurants I have visited. Everything was satisfactory."
Marsala Food Company,Gautam Narang,05 May 2019,1,"We went for a lunch outing here. It‚Äôs located at DLF. The ambience is good and we expected a good meal. We ordered Chicken Tangdi, Mutton Biryani and Coke. First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn‚Äôt juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.

In the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn‚Äôt chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.

And finally, we got our biryani. It was not bad; but, there were no Meaty pieces of Mutton; Only bones.

My advice to you all would be that the food is edible but don‚Äôt keep your expectations too high."
Marsala Food Company,Prasad Narale,04 May 2019,4,"Food is good. Ambience and interior very nice for groups and couples. Scope to improve service.
We tried chetinad chicken , preparation was ok ok but the chicken was good."
Marsala Food Company,Manohar,03 May 2019,3,"Was really waiting to visit this place after all the good reviews. Was quite disappointed with the food and the menu of the buffet. Not a single stand out dish , chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear. Deserts are so so. Biryani was fine but chicken was very dry , same case with the fish starter just horrible. Fruit custard had only bananas.even their water tasted like chemically treated. Service was alright but this place is highly over rated on zomato."
Marsala Food Company,Prachi Pant,28 April 2019,4,"Had chicken and veg biryani full! Can vouch gor chicken.. good and Very spicy and yummy. Loved the food, the ambience and the service.. very polite staff.. and clean place!! Would recommend one visit atleast!"
Marsala Food Company,Mahathi Natva,27 April 2019,4,Visited this place in person and also had food delivered from it. The Mandi and the biryani are some of the personal favorites. But I happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling. The biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly Cooked meat. If you are a biryani person and want to try some of the best this place should be on your list.
Marsala Food Company,Sangeetha S,27 April 2019,3,Food was delicious. But the ambience and the service provided were poor. Every order took at least 40mins to be served. Very poor cleanliness. Not sure if I would visit again for a hang out.
Marsala Food Company,Jhansi,26 April 2019,5,"Lovely food!! Totally enjoyed it:)

Thanks for the great experience!! Enjoyed the food with team!

Panneer Labardhar is so yummy!! Must item to be tried by all the vegeterians!!"
Marsala Food Company,Deepak Arora,26 April 2019,4,I ordered paneer butter masala and paneer lababdar. Both of them were decent but one thing which shocked me was there was no kadhai paneer in the menu. Otherwise all the things were nice including ambiance and the serving and the taste of the food was good. I'll prefer to go once more and taste other things too.
Marsala Food Company,Sai Keerthi,25 April 2019,5,"We were here for a new joinee party with team of 10 people, buffet lunch.
Overwhelmed with their service and courtesy 4/5
Tasty, delicious,mouth watering 4+4 starters were served which were amazing
A paradise for Biryani lovers, never expected Biryani in main course would be this amazing anywhere else
The varieties in desserts is quite different here, which included 'KA' for all-
Double Ka metta, kadu ka kheer, gajar ka Halwa, kubani Ka metta.
Rate the buffet(food)- 5/5
Ambience-4/5
Servicing- 4/5
Would definitely visit againüòÅ"
Marsala Food Company,Pradeep Kumar,24 April 2019,2,"Well... After going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. We opted to go for buffet option. The taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that‚Äôs what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it‚Äôs ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience. I would like to suggest the management one thing, If you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don‚Äôt."
Marsala Food Company,Wagsman09,24 April 2019,4,"Clean and neat place for some Arabian food as we usually get to see some unhygienic places for this cuisine and mainly Mandi.

Went for lunch with a group of ten and got to order many varieties as we opted for ala carte even though the Buffet was reasonable and had many varieties.

Mandi rice was great but chicken faham isn‚Äôt soft at all. Mushroom tikka is sweet as it contains some raisins.
Food :3.50
Service : little slow. Plan and order in one shot
Hygiene : 4
VFM : 3.5
Worth visiting once more: Yes
Must try : Mandi"
Marsala Food Company,Sudipta Routray,22 April 2019,5,I visited the resturant last week with my team mates for team lunch for buffet.. Food was really good for both veg/non veg items.. Straters were extremely delicious.. Buffet menu was simple and really tasty.. Worth visiting the resturant for multiple times.
Marsala Food Company,Jharna Karira,21 April 2019,1,"The place is overrated, we went on a Friday afternoon, it was too crowded, had to wait for 15 mins to get a table, once we got the table, order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting, we had to run behind the waiter to take the order, order was then taken, we had Apollo fish, kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi, the fish tasted good, chicken was not cooked properly, coming to mandi, it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice, wasn't great at all, and the mandi was around 585rs, I'd rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600.
Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed."
Marsala Food Company,Girishtatikonda,11 April 2019,4,"Decent place with good ambience specially the serving is good. Ajay‚Äôs guest interaction and serving the food within time appreciable and food is delicious I didn‚Äôt expect this place fills our tummy with satisfaction, had nice time."
Marsala Food Company,Anish Patwardhan,10 April 2019,5,"This is newly opened place near Gachibowli DLF, very famous for mandi. Our server was Kishore ,he served us very well and politely. We ordered mushroom moti tikka, chicken mughlai both the items were very good."
Marsala Food Company,Abhay Hora,10 April 2019,1,"I think the restaurant is over rated. We chose this place based on their zomato rating and ended up being at a place where only decent thing was the ambience.
Being a restaurant, as they call it (I would term it as a local tiffin centre).
They charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum ‚Äî 2 curries, 1 dal as their main course. BTW, ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special. üòÅ
Food was tasteless, their veg hara bhara kebab was stale. Earlier I felt their non veg would be good, probably the reason for the rating. But to my surprise, my foodie friends (non veg lovers) said it was worse than veg. mind you, it happens rarely with them, they can over rate any average non veg restaurant. But this was worse.
I am forced to believe the reviews are paid."
Marsala Food Company,Naman Goyal,08 April 2019,1,It such a worst experience will never come back again. The chicken didn't cook properly and even they didn't replace and charged price for that
Marsala Food Company,Nandita Agarwal,08 April 2019,4,"As a North Indian joint in Hyderabad, Marsala food company doesn't disappoint at all. And being a gold partner, things become even better.
We ordered crispy salt and pepper vegtables as a starter which was a good portion size and enough for two people to share.
For main course we went with the recommendation of paneer lababdar with garlic naan. The quantity was enough for two people and the paneer lababdar was medium spicy. It was made just like how it is made in the North.
If someone is looking for North Indian, marsala food company should be tried!"
Marsala Food Company,Atif Kidwai,06 April 2019,5,Ordered Special Chicken Curry and Chicken Kolhapuri. Do try Marsala special chicken curry as it was so rich and delicious. Saajan was very hospitable. The ambition is very nice and staff is courteous. Must try üëç
Marsala Food Company,Ashwin Madakasira,05 April 2019,1,"The place has either bought paid reviews or the management has changed or something similar, because we went looking at all the reviews here and it was horrible.
Food is cold tastless, serving is slow and tardy. Most of the items in buffet were not available for the entire two hours we were there.
And to top it,there werent many items served in the buffet"
Marsala Food Company,Sudhir Raju,05 April 2019,1,Starters were served cold...all they did was reheat..spoons were dusty and not clean..we had buffet and some of the items were missing overall food taste rating 1/5 ..ambience 3/5
Marsala Food Company,Santhosh Reddy V,05 April 2019,2,"Buffet is a disaster. No fresh food, all the deserts are from previous day. Service is pathetic and no friendly environment. Menu listed about 8 deserts but there are only 5- 6 and that too in open vessals."
Marsala Food Company,Jayson J Jariwala,05 April 2019,1,"Yesterday we visited this place at 8:30pm. We are 10 people. There was not that much rush in restaurant. If you are going with Zomato gold offer, they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money. Overall very worst experience. Tomato soup with weird smell. We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

Ambiance - 4/5
Food - 1/5
Service - 1/5"
Marsala Food Company,Kamlesh Murudkar,04 April 2019,3,"We like to explore all places which serve good nonveg food and seeing the reviews on zomato, decided to try this restaurant near dlf in gachibowli. Overall experience was ok and nothing great. They have a big dinning area. We ordered marsala special chicken gravy and roti. Which was with an omelette on top. The taste wasn't something special and we could not get the proper flavour of this gravy. Basa fish tikka was not as soft as we get it elsewhere. Usually it melts in mouth and is super soft and tasty but we were disappointed here."
Marsala Food Company,Goutam Acharya,04 April 2019,5,"Good place,order makes you to wait but when the order come the taste of food makes you feel Good,friendly staff #Sajan#take my order usually I have been to marsala many times"
Marsala Food Company,Hyderabadisbest,03 April 2019,4,we went as a group of 17 people for the buffet. there was widespread of starters 4 non veg and 4 veg. All the starters were good. The main course was ok and the desserts were good but they were not available after some time. it is a good place and worth the visit for the cost.
Marsala Food Company,Food-Hud,03 April 2019,5,"Thanks @marsalafoodcompany01 for hosting us and for being such an attentive host üòä
.
.
Heard a lot about @marsalafoodcompany01 before, but never that we thought that we will have such an amazing experience
.
.
Few days back we headed Marsala for dinner. The moment we entered, it was so beautiful to see lights and colors everywhere.
.
When the ambience is good, it already makes half the things right
.
We had some awesome Starters like: Arabian Chicken Soup, Paneer Papdi Kabab, Fish 65, Chicken Lahori Tikka, Golden Fried Babycorn üòã
.
All of them tasted heaven, but our personal fav was Paneer Papdi Kabab, Chicken Lahori and Golden Fried Babycorn üíØ
.
In main course had a massive Fish Grilled Mandi..burrrppp!! üôà and then had the 2 beauties who came to tingle our tastebuds: Kit-Kat Shake and Chocolate MilkShake
.

If you are from #hyderabad and crave for Arabian, Indian or Chinese Cuisine, specially if you are from#gachibowli , then this place is a must visit ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Marsala Food Company,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,02 April 2019,5,"I visited this place with my fellow bloggers. We had all come here for lunch. A place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time. We all came here with a lot of expectations and Marsala Food company didn't dissapoint us at all. We tasted a lot of items on the menu. The best and my personal favorite was the kit Kat shake. It was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. The lemon Coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg Wonton Soup was good. It is not a must try and can be avoided ! Nothing special about it ! This was the only item that wasn't very good .Deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! Undoubtedly one of the best on the menu It is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few Manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. A treat for the mouth! We also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. We were all happy with the curry and rotis . The gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. Especially the gulab jamun !
Fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution ! Even the people who don't have a sweet tooth will love it! A place that is a must visit"
Marsala Food Company,Gokul Aketi,02 April 2019,1,"Nothing good. Tried buffet. You need to get your plates for starters. Water will be provided only if you ask. Starters are not at all good, especially fish. We didn't seen any difference in look between fish and baby corn. Main course is limited and are not available readily for us. We need to wait for 10min to get curries. Roti are pathetic, not fresh. Even desserts are bad. Only good thing is icecream which is served in single cup"
Marsala Food Company,Pravallika Loya,01 April 2019,5,"Marsala food company located near DLF Gachibowli, is a multi cuisine restaurant serving Arabian, Chinese and some Indian dishes. This has been on my wish list from so long. So made a visit here, with a bunch of friends and the place is simple.

Golden fried babycorn,
Murg achari tikka,

Chilli paneer,
Chilli basil prawn,

Kubani ka meetha,
Khaddu ka kheer,
Double ka meetha
Loved the gulab jamun and khaddu ka kheer.
.
Over all a Decent place to visit with some good ambience."
Marsala Food Company,Rohit Reddy,31 March 2019,3,"Been to this place after looking at the ratings. We had a mushroom Moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness. In the main course we had chicken biryani which was just decent with bland taste and little masala. The service was decent and so as the ambience.
I would rate this place as
Food - 3/5
Service - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5"
Marsala Food Company,Rameez Siddiqui,31 March 2019,5,"Visited this place recently as it has become the talk of the town .
We started off with Paneer Papdi Kebab and Chilly Paneer with Crispy Corn and Veg Sheek kebab from the Veg starters. Extremely Delicious and my favorite was the Chilly Paneer.
The Non veg starters were haryali Fish Tikka ,Chilly Basil Prawns and Lahori Chicken Kebab.
The Chilly Basil Prawns were really good and perfect in every way.
The showstoppers were the Mutton Juicy Mandi and the Fish Mandi! Such a perfect taste of the Mandi rice. Can easily compete with Barkas Mandi Houses.
The Desserts, well we tried them all like the Apricot Delight , Shahi Tukda, kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite Gulab Jamun.
The Awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the Kitkat Shake. Really Do try the Kitkat Shake.
Highly recommend this place to everyone."
Marsala Food Company,Rishu Kumar,29 March 2019,5,"It can't be expressed in words.. The prompt service they gave, the taste of freshly cooked tandoori chicken with perfect spice & appearance, the authentic taste of chicken tikka biryani (10000 Times better that Paradise biryani), the perfect type of ambience & a variety of sitting place with outside road view.... All were amazing and more than expectation. U will find little expensive at begining.. But trust me, the quality and quantity they provides, is really value for money. Just go and visit once at least.

Thanks"
Marsala Food Company,Meha Gupta,29 March 2019,1,"Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

Highly disappointed."
Marsala Food Company,Tasty Hyderabad,28 March 2019,5,"I heard so much about this place and i finally got to visit. I was there with few of my friends where we got to try their traditional authentic dishes.
The ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The service is also quite fast.
We first started off with Arabian chicken soup and a Veg soup.

Then we tried their starters Paneer papdi kebab, Veg sheekh kebab, Lahori chicken kebab, Golden fried babycorn, Fish hariyali, Chilli basil prawn, Chilli paneer and Crispy corn chilli pepper.

For the maincourse we first tried Grilled fish mandi and Mutton juicy mandi. I wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day.
Then we tried Special fried rice with veg manchurian, Special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also Veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads.

We also tried few mocktails Virgin mojito, Kotkat milkshake and Chocolate milkshkae.

We finally ended our meal with few desserts Gulab jamun, Apricol delight, Double ka meetha and Kheer"
Marsala Food Company,Syeda @food__vampire,27 March 2019,5,"It was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

Marsala Food Company,Tummy Monster,27 March 2019,2,They're just degrading the quality of mandi day by day.. really need to take a look into this and improve on both quality and quantity of pieces instead of just increasing prices in the menu
Marsala Food Company,The Hungry Indians,27 March 2019,5,"Have been craving for their mandi after seeing so many pictures and hearing many good reviews
And finally had a chance to try their mandi and other items from the menu
.
.
Started with some hot arabian mutton soup
One of the best and a must try here
.
In their starters
Chicken pahadi kabab , hariyali fish tikka and golden fried baby corn were really good
And also we tried this interesting item
Mushroom moti tikka it was filled with kova
Must try if u are fond of mushrooms
.
.
And finally we tried their mandi
Chicken fried mandi : this has to be my new fav mandi
Rice was flavourful and chicken was super yumm
Mutton juicy mandi customised with fish fry : fish were fried perfectly and tasted great
Mutton piece needs a little improvement
Was a bit hard
.
.
In thier desserts kaddu kheer tasted good"
Marsala Food Company,Abhinav Verma,24 March 2019,3,"Chilly corn in veg starters were very good, tandoori paneer veg starter was not up to mark,lot of oil ,even bread crumbs in tomato soup were too oily. Rest ambience and service are good here."
Marsala Food Company,Snehal Kondaveeti,23 March 2019,3,"Marsala Food company is an alright place to have a quick lunch if you don‚Äôt want to travel far from work. We ordered a mutton biryani and literally had to tug the mutton pieces apart; they were really hard. The food is fine and doesn‚Äôt actually reach the fine dining standards the restaurant boats of. The place could use better service and food quality.
Overall, not a bad place to have a meal."
Marsala Food Company,Tummyful_hyd,22 March 2019,5,"Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ‚ù§ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one üòâ And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! üòç"
Marsala Food Company,Love4cibo,22 March 2019,5,"I was so keen to try this place after the pictures of their delicious juicy mutton and chicken Mandi.

Finally I was here along with my friends to try their Mandi and starters.

Marsala Food Company,Nagesh Sathi,21 March 2019,3,I have ordered mandi rice and fried chicken piece. The rice is not up to mark and chicken is medium. The gravys also not thick. Over all the food is average and ambience is good.
Marsala Food Company,Foodisbae,21 March 2019,5,"I had a food session here. The service was very nice and food was nice too. They have this two amazing varieties of soups, Arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup, which were amazing. Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I‚Äôm in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell."
Marsala Food Company,Harshita,18 March 2019,1,"The food of the place was nice except for ‚ÄòMurg Malai Tikka‚Äô, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money. The reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu. The staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in. The staff should learn how to behave with the customers.

(1 star is also too much depending upon how the staff behaved with us last night when I went with a group of friends)"
Marsala Food Company,Vadani Mail,18 March 2019,5,Food is very tasty ... yummy....I ordered food twice in Zomato....it delivered on time.... tandoori is my favourite....it is delicious.....my friend suggested me this restaurant
Marsala Food Company,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),17 March 2019,3,"Went there for dinner. Tried Chicken Mandi and double ka meetha. Quantity of Mandi was good for two. Double ka meetha was average. Ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the AC could have been a little high and service a little fast. I also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around.

Marsala Food Company,Jagithyala Animesh,17 March 2019,3,"Visitng the place around 10 pm and the ataff was not friendly at all.
Nice location
Decent ambience
Require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location"
Marsala Food Company,Karna Nair,16 March 2019,5,"Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit."
Marsala Food Company,Simanto Bagchi,16 March 2019,1,"Customers won't really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par. I ordered Chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. The chicken tasted horrible and was stale. I had to throw away the biryani. You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here. I did not expect this kind of service and I really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future."
Marsala Food Company,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,3,"Average food and ambience. Though food range is good and has a good pick of Arabic, Indian and Chinese. Not enough parking. Service is OK. Not much crowded on weekend when we went."
Marsala Food Company,Rakesh ( TripAnzo ),16 March 2019,5,"Sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it's just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you'll find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you'll also find couches and tables well as this place serves Arabian food specifically for Mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so I had Arabian Chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next

I got my hands on their starters like

Chicken Pahadi kKebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Kung Pao Mushroom
Paneer Papdi Kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what I liked the most among the starters were Kung Pao Mushroom dragon Chicken and banjara kebab and I felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

Getting into the main course now I tried Mutton Juicy Mandi chicken Tangdi Mandi and grilled fish Mandi I personally liked chicken Tangdi Mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as I love spicy food

Treating myself with the milkshakes and Desserts now in milkshakes I tried chocolate, butterscotch and KitKat I liked the KitKat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then KitKat as a cherry on the top and in desserts I had gajar Ka Halwa double Ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer I liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar Ka Halwa and double Ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all I would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper Arabian meal !!"
Marsala Food Company,Nikita Kumari,16 March 2019,1,Ordered chicken biryani from here. I was totally disappointed with the food. The biryani was stale and the chicken pieces tasted really bad. Never ordering again.
Marsala Food Company,Ram Chandra Pandit,15 March 2019,1,"Food quality has detoriated over past couple of months. Have been a regular customer of marsala via zomato. I guess marsala is having too much of business via zomato, for which it has stop caring about food quality for its online customers."
Marsala Food Company,Vipul,14 March 2019,4,Marsala special noodles with gobi Manchurian were perfected to the taste. Ambience is average. Courteous staff. Clean washrooms. Will visit again.
Marsala Food Company,Prudhvi Reddy Nallamilli,13 March 2019,1,"Very much disappointed with food and items here . Not even a single item is satisfied

Though service is ok

But main Moto should be serve the best food."
Marsala Food Company,Aravind Ranganathan,13 March 2019,4,"First time visited this restaurant , I have given a try by looking over the ambience. Good thing is , I wasnt disappointed and service from the management is quite good

Talking about the food, Being a veggie tried some Panner, corns , rotis and soup . Happy with the way it's been prepared , served and taste as well.

Overall the experience was good with the restaurant with a little disappointment over the parking. You need to find it by yourself as there is no dedicated parking lots."
Marsala Food Company,Deepak Mangavalli,12 March 2019,1,The best place where you will get worst tangdi kabab. Same is informed to staff rather taking action they try to convince us to eat.........
Marsala Food Company,Vishnu S,12 March 2019,4,On weekend we were in search of restaurant to have hyderabadi dum biryani. As we entered out of office we found number of restaurants(all were busy). We found this restaurant in the third floor and thought of visiting this place becoz it is third floor and will not be much crowded but surprisingly people where waiting for seats. We ordered for chicken kebabs for starter which was perfectly cooked with awesome taste and after that we ordered chicken biryani which was came up with nice quality and superb taste with good enough quantity. By the seeing the price of biryani we got shocked and after looking at the biryani quantity surprised. Serious it was good quantity for the price. After a gap of two weeks we again visited the place have Al mandi and we order for grilled chicken mandi which of average taste.
Marsala Food Company,Ekta Bhatia,10 March 2019,3,"This was our first visit. While the ambience is nice, we felt that their food was okay.

Basa fish tikka: it wasn't as soft and melting into our mouths as normally it should. We have had better tikkas. Would rate 3/5

Marsala special chicken curry: again nothing special about the preparation except that they served it with an omlet. 3/5"
Marsala Food Company,Prashanth Pinnamaneni,06 March 2019,1,"Worst experience ever, Mandi lovers please avoid visiting this place to avoid huge disappointment, post office hours visited the place to have Mandi, Ambience was below average, there were no customers in the restaurant, we ordered 3 Mandis, which has arrived after 30 minutes and the rice was cold and not tasty at all, the meat served was so tough, waste of money, not at all worth, please donot visit this place by seeing 4.2 stars in Zomato profile, we will never go back to this place again. Would have given zero stars if i had a option, over all this place is just waste of your time and money."
Marsala Food Company,Rahul Otreja,03 March 2019,4,It is a decent place. We ordered paneer butter masala and chicken tikka masala. Both items were very well prepared. Service was prompt. We enjoyed food a lot and it was not that costly too.
Marsala Food Company,Asithakesakambal,03 March 2019,2,"I ordered a mutton seekh kebab and a chicken biryani. The kebab was ok ~ 3/5 but the chicken biryani was really bad ~ 1/5. I never waste food. If there is excess, I parcel it but this biryani I just have to leave it and come. Even the chicken pieces are not at all tasty.
The ambiance is average , there are different types of seatings and they had pleasant lighting.
Overall 2/5."
Marsala Food Company,Sathya K,02 March 2019,4,Highly recommended.. Great food!! The biryani is a must have herw. The place have some amazing staff ...!! Loved the attentiveness and quick service.. worth visiting.
Marsala Food Company,Rishabh Kumar,01 March 2019,4,"I found this restaurant on zomato and also I can see the ratings of this restaurant is good. I visited for lunch and ordered Loose prawns, Chicken biryani, Tandoori fish tikka and Tandoori prawns biryani. All the dishes were superb in taste. Even their quality and quantity are excellent. Tandoori fish tikka wins my heart amongs whatever I ordered. Ambiance is good and loved their hospitality."
Marsala Food Company,Alisha,28 February 2019,4,"Nice place to hangout with colleagues after a hectic day at work. Feel good place in a crowded location like DLF
Nice ambience
Food was good
And they have very different seating arrangement which was nice too."
Marsala Food Company,Chaithanya Guptha Gollapalli,28 February 2019,4,"Soups: Had tomato soup and sweet corn veg soup, both especially the tomato soup along with tiny breadsticks was delicious.

Starters: Ordered crispy corn chilli pepper and Paneer papdi kebab. Was very much disappointed with the quantity they gave. We only get 4 pieces of paneer papdi kebab. It was crispy and tasty but could've used a little more spice. The crispy corn being crispy corn tasted wonderful! 

Main Course: Ordered Paneer Tikka Biryani, and Butter Naan along with Kaju Paneer. The butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani I've ever tasted. The paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it. Though the biryani could've used a little more spice, it tasted great! 

Ambiance & Service: This is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch. So couldn't really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good. One complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it. Avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours. The service was a little late but the staff was friendly. Kudos to that! 

P.S. The only thing stopping me from giving a 3 star is that biryani and those soups! Loved them so much that I couldn't give them a 3!"
Marsala Food Company,Parijat Ray,28 February 2019,2,I have visited this restaurant with a group of 10 people. I have also ordered from here online. The food quality was not upto the mark for both the cases. The food served to us was stale. The ambience is nice though and the staffs are friendly too.
Marsala Food Company,Sohani Nanda,27 February 2019,4,"Ambiance- Good
Staffs- they dont have a lot of staffs to buzz around you but whoever is there they are very courteous.
Price- price is good
Must have- paneer lababdar and fish tikka
Food- food was good,quantity is also good as per price
Good place for casual dinner"
Marsala Food Company,PJ Hari,24 February 2019,1,"Ordered mutton Biryani after reading good reviews. And the result is bad. Rice itself was so bland. Mutton pieces looks melting but the aroma and taste of the pieces also bad. So bad that i could not even finish any single piece completely. On the whole, if you are here for mutton Biryani, i recommend not to take. Fyi, I'm Hyderabadi Biryani lover."
Marsala Food Company,Ravalika Reddy,23 February 2019,5,"The food here is so appetizing.Especially pahadi murgh is so mouth-watering...all the food we ordered is so well-seasoned .It is definitely a go-to place to enjoy .All the food lovers ,what is the wait for then?"

Marsala Food Company,Manoj Gurrevala,15 February 2019,4,"Restaurant is having simple and good looking ambience. Party type of seating, Handi type of seating also available. Coming to the dishes, items are tasty and justifying quantity for the prices. Staff were polite and prompt service we can observe. Baby corn Manchuria and Dragon Chicken must try here. But, nite that we can't expect Hyderabadi styled biriyani here."
Marsala Food Company,Avinash,15 February 2019,5,"Being an eggetarian, had ordered an egg biryani....I can say this is one of the best egg biryani‚Äôs you get near hitech city cluster. My friend had prawn biryani....and had heard very positive feedback from him.
Finally, had a pleasing lunch( I can say gastronomical pleasure).
Food - 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è (no second thought)

Marsala Food Company,Saipramod Nibhanipudi,15 February 2019,1,Food was cold and hospitality was bad. Had to wait for soo long to get food. Prefer going to other restaurants than this. Had bad experience.
Marsala Food Company,Kalyan Madduru,14 February 2019,5,"This restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. All the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. Ambience was good. We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)"
Marsala Food Company,Vinay,12 February 2019,4,"I gotta tell you this is the best place in gachibowli with a pocket friendly collection. Went here for lunch and unfortunately some part of this store is not really having shades which resulted in sunlight falling on us while lunch. Did not feel comfortable while seating there, later we moved on to different table.

        Ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place. Service is good, quite descent number of servers. Impressed with their work polite, calm and patient. having enough said about the service and ambiance let's skip into the food!

Veg corn soup: Touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup, the veg soup tasted extremely well.

Tomato : Crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table.

chicken soup: I would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had. Minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste.

Mutton shorba: Well, this is also a mouth watering dish over here, loved the taste of shorba. The hot soup served with the piece of mutton, can really make your day!!

  
Crispy Corn : Spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost! 

Chicken Spring Roll: This is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us. not really tasty though. 

Loose Prawns : Neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more.

Chicken Chettinad : well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need. 

chicken mughlai : Spicy enough, delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food, this dish never dissapoints you. 

Panner Biryani : wasn't really impressed with panner biryani though, it could do better. 

chicken Biryani: Since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour. I suggest it's better to ask before preparing the food. 

Food : 4.5
Ambiance:3.5
Service : 4.0"
Marsala Food Company,Raj Esh,11 February 2019,4,"Decent place with decent food items. Been here for mandhi, tasted chicken and mutton mandhi. Taste wise its üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª but rates are bit high as per me. It would be great if the management give a thought on price on food items."
Marsala Food Company,Parakh Khandelwal,10 February 2019,4,"Good food... Good service... Nice ambience.... Freindly staff...

Must try
Paneer Lababdar with butter roti.

Can also try
Papri paneer kebab
Prawn briyani and fish tikka."
Club Rogue,Suman Ghosh,25 May 2019,3,"Visited this place on a weekday afternoon, and it was mostly empty. But by the decor it felt that the place will look lively in the evenings, so will give it a shot sometime. Happy hours was on, so we got Absolut for ~150 (Smirnoff was ~70 - which seemed like a better deal), along with the other stuff. Tried a couple of veg & paneer starters. Food was nothing to write home about - but overall a decent (and pocket-friendly) place for a quick afternoon round of drinks."
Club Rogue,Deepak Dhara,22 May 2019,4,"Now that's a banger of a place.. just out of the world experience . Folks are going Mad.üòé!

Music is just awesome and all people do here is hit the floor.

Ambience is cool and food good.

But it's the electric atmosphere thats the special point of this place."
Club Rogue,Venkat.Ch,21 May 2019,4,"Just went to this place for a couple of drinks.. As drained by the sun a lot.. Good place good ambinace and hide place to hang on.. Get to know apart from weekend Friday and Saturday rest all the days are ladies night... That sounds awesome.. When u have a girl with u..

Price range is OK...
Ambiance is 4
Service i did not understood any thing because its just few drinks n snacks..

Would love to comeback.. Keep upthe good work."
Club Rogue,Karthik Thayi Suresh,19 May 2019,1,"Food taste isn't good and the staff behaviour is the major let down. They fight and argue with you to give more tips.
Very disappointing. Never ever experienced it."
Club Rogue,Ashok Reddy,18 May 2019,3,"You like crowd?!
like really big crowd ?! Then this is the place you should go!! Also drinks are so cheap here!

Service was okay for me, nothing worth mentioning!
Music wasn‚Äôt that good! Just loud!
Not so great food!

You got the good and bad about this place!!
you decide whether to go or not :)"
Club Rogue,Ankit Saraf,18 May 2019,4,"Great place to hangout.
Good food + Good drinks + Great DJ + Nice ambience sums up my experience.
Very few of the clubs which plays Bollywood songs . Would love to visit the place again."
Club Rogue,Subhasis Saha,11 May 2019,2,"Too crowded all the time. The crowd management is not that great. Coming here with girls to party sometimes become a risk, especially on the dance floor. Otherwise it is a good place to hang around if you like loud music. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place for a girls group to go to."
Club Rogue,Ravalika,09 May 2019,4,"Food -5/5
Ambience-4/5

Must try in this place are
Kung pao fish
Schezwan chicken
Garlic chicken
Bhutan chicken
Pepper fish"
Club Rogue,Akshay Anand,04 May 2019,2,"The music was unbearably loud. The food was good but the place was overcrowded and the service was bad. Overall, not so welcoming for a comeback."
Club Rogue,Ka Divya,04 May 2019,3,"The ambience was decent, but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded (understandable!). The music was good, the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us. We actually became a little uncomfortable after that, because we were right in front of him, waving hands (not drunk at all, because we were asking for out first drink of the night), and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us. Looks like he had something againts us! ;)"
Club Rogue,Dinesh Naidu,03 May 2019,3,"Overcrowded is the first thing that comes to my mind. They have a really big place but I guess not well managed, it‚Äôs like open for all, people smoking everywhere. DJ was below average and the sound systems can improve.

Overall 3/5
Ambience 2/5
Food 4/5"
Club Rogue,Aishwarya Verma,02 May 2019,4,"Good place, good vibe! Their Bollywood music could get better but currently it's the best available in this area of the city. The food's good too."
Club Rogue,Srinivas Reddy Pidaparti,29 April 2019,5,Good place to enjoy the music with food and decent drinks.It's a bit crowded but what's fun without the crowd :D Been here many times never disappoints me except for the fact that they keep asking for my ID .Place where you don't need a plus one in Hyderabad especially.
Club Rogue,Lokendra Chawhan,28 April 2019,3,"Cheap n Crowded even on weekdays

Ladies night all weekday (mon-thu)

Excellent place to get drunk n dance like crazy

Music was loud n awkward - all hindi songs that too many unknowns
Dj was below average - seems like youtube videos autoplay was playing

Great for people who want some fun on weekdays"
Club Rogue,Sonam Agrawal,27 April 2019,1,We went there around 8.30 for having a fun night. But the place turned out to be a cheap place where people are allowed to smoke everywhere. We cant even breathe properly.Then we order vodka..it was like water and when we questioned them he smiled and kind of agreed.Then we ordered Long island Tea and asked him to make it a good one but it was even worse. Even their virgin mohito was not gud.Then the food was also okish.Staff were also not courteous.I find the place was overcrowded. It seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on us.I will never recommend anyone here.
Club Rogue,Nikitha Reddy,26 April 2019,3,Okay ! This place seems okay not so great. Tables are too small in which we cannot put more than three food items. And it was saturday night the DJ supposed to start at 8pm we were waiting for the songs to be played till 9:30pm yet no music nothing. And we left the place.
Club Rogue,Sharang Patro,21 April 2019,5,One the best places to hangout specially when you don't want to spend much . The food is great and going in the group would be best . The music and ambience is actually worth it. But please book a table before 8 on weekends as it gets much crowded. Recommended places to go .
Club Rogue,Aprajita Kashyap,21 April 2019,4,Club Rogue is a nice place to hangout with friends and have a laid back beer on a weekday as well. The service is excellent. The menu has lots of options in veg as well as non veg. The DJ was excellent and we had the time of our lives dancing. The crowd was amazing. There are lots of options in drinks as well. Must visit.
Club Rogue,Yash Sheth,21 April 2019,4,"Club rogue ... located in Gachibowli is a good place party and dance if you have gone out with your friends on weekends. The place is usually full and suggestion would be to go in early and get yourself a table. Here you can have some drinks and then dance and yes the food is also quite good. Only issues .... the tables are small, and hence not much can be placed on the table. Saw lots of bottles fall and break. But regardless, this is a good place if you really wanna party hard."
Club Rogue,Neha Choudhary,21 April 2019,1,"Whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took ""Rogue"" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
I would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there."
Club Rogue,Ashish Sharma,21 April 2019,1,"Ambience sucks... Worst service.... They don't book tables and when I asked a waiter for a table for 4, he just ignores and stares away... When we managed to make a waiter arrange a table for us, he just keeps a table in the middle of the way and asks us to stand throughout our course for the evening... Well we finally made to a normal table by waiting for others to vacate.... I highly recommend not to go to this place.... Just sitting outside the building and talking to my friends was lot better than ruining our evening by going to this shitty place..."
Club Rogue,Sardarpreetpalsingh,18 April 2019,5,Awesome place one of the best places in hyderabar... Girish was awesome he made sure we had great time....the dj was the best ive seen in hderabad
Club Rogue,Sravanthi Kumsi,17 April 2019,2,"Been to Club Rogue last Saturday I.e. 13th April 2019. We chose this place as it was a Bollywood night. Lot of things to get told about this place.
First, coming to the ambience. It's a nice big place. The pricing is reasonable. We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
Now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
The Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.
Overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.
Service was good. We were attended to well, by our server Mr. Kunal."
Club Rogue,Pongsi Hangsing,17 April 2019,1,Manager was so cheap n attitude showing ego to the guest ..we visited thrice this time .. management pliz take serious action to the manager or else he vil let the business down..
Club Rogue,Santosh Kumar Kabra,15 April 2019,2,"Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid."
Club Rogue,Avinash Ganapa,12 April 2019,1,"I am at this place @1:38 Friday 12th. My girlfriend ordered Mango Blossom, this bar tender here adds chat masala in store bought mango juice.

How does the word blossom relate to chat masala.

Disgusting treatment here at club rogue"
Club Rogue,Raja Srivathsav,12 April 2019,1,"Cheap place.
Really bad service.

This place has a quiet weird rule. If you show your office ID card they‚Äôll not be charging a cover amount. Else you‚Äôll have to pay a cover charge.

The bar attenders are so ill mannered, I was almost about to slap one.
If you can‚Äôt talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar!
I‚Äôve asked for a Budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that I ordered kingfisher. (I‚Äôm okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).

Food was average and served medium hot (I think I was served someone else‚Äôs cancelled order item)

Music was terrible! There was some desi dj who was playing songs out of YouTube and there was no quality mixing.

Ambience: 3
Service: 0
Management: 0

Will I visit this place: NEVER
Will I recommend this place: HELL NO!"
Club Rogue,Shubhangi.1693,11 April 2019,4,One of d best place. Esp for North Indian ! Good music happening place. Get damn crowded on weekend.so beware üòä food was ok ok ! Drinks are not so costly. Good place for ppl wd dancing shoes and ready to burn calories. Get ur gang here.
Club Rogue,Chirag Gupta ?,05 April 2019,2,"The food and drinks are good.
The ambience is great too.
But the place feels too crowded and the dance floor sucks.
The DJ music is alright.
The staff is not good and need to be given proper training.
The way they rush guests out after 12 is too bad."
Club Rogue,Subhajeet Rout,02 April 2019,4,This place is usual hangout place for guys as it allows to enter if you have a corporate ID.Also this place is packed almost everyday.You get to hear all types of music in one night so yeah it is worth going here to dance and habe fun.Getting a table here is bit difficult due to the crowd.Food and Drinks are cheap here.One thing I dont like here is people who dont know how to behave on dance floor with girls.That annoys me a lot.But that is not a frequent thing and can be fixed by bouncers being more proactive.Thanks
Club Rogue,Wajiha Kaukab,01 April 2019,2,"Thrice I visited this place thinking it might change my opinion but as always it was a disappointment. The staff and the manager extremely rude the service really bad. Looks like the place does not need customers at all coz I haven‚Äôt come across any waiter who would refuse to serve. Complained to the manger who was equally rude !
Food and drinks are alright but I got wine served in a plastic foggy glass üòì I go out for the experience when I spend money üí∞. I‚Äôm not sure about the others but I had a horrible experience."
Club Rogue,Rajsi Gaikwad,27 March 2019,3,"Read mixed reviews about this place. But the only thing which dragged us here is that the DJ here plays Bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the DJ and the dance floor. The place is also very beautiful. But the service here sucks, the waiters are rude. We couldn't order food as the waiters weren't responding properly. Even for drinks (tired of waiting for them to take order) we went to the bar and ordered.
So if you you to enjoy only the dance floor, only them I would recommend this place."
Club Rogue,Prateek Pole,25 March 2019,1,The manager named Siddarth was treating us very badly. We went with a few girls. The other guys around were teasing our friends. When we asked him he said he can't do anything. He does not have minimum courtesy to talk politely with the customers. The staff lack basic professionalism. One of my worst experiences.
Club Rogue,Harish,25 March 2019,1,"I went to club rouge since the day it started,I have been to this place more than 150 times.It was like a hangout place for us to always go.It was beautiful in the starting,less crowd and only couples were allowed to dance floors and people dint stand on tables and all that time to dance.Bouncers were pretty good at that time and the manager at that time was also very nice and polite.In the past few months since the manager changed,his name is siddharth the club rougue we knew was no more there.This angry little manager is the worst human u could ecer talk to.Single girls beware to go to this place.They allow cheap bastards into the club who doesn't drink and doesn't even have a table,they keep roaming all around the club to find girls and talk with them or make em uncomfy by staring at them and not moving from there table.I even saw a guy putting a tablet into some girls drink.Coming to my incident,Yesterday i went to this place to watch afternoon ipl match which was at 4.We went there at 5 and it was happy hours,which we don know or never cared about happy hours in clubs.We started watching match and at 6 a waiter comes saying pls pay bill since happy hours is ended.We said okay and we paid.Now the waiter says please leave, we were like wtf we came to watch the match and we will leave only after it's done.Then he calls the manager.His name is SIDDHARTH.This guy is one horrible crap who thinks since he is the manager of the club he's an avenger superhero.He came to us and said which a very tone u people have to leave,I told that's not happening we are hyderabadi's and it's srh match and we will leave only when it's done and he started shouting and telling no with so much attitude.Later he said 30mins and left.He wasn't coming when I was calling him also.He comes after 30mins and says go,When we told we will not leave until the match is done he told he will call bouncers and make us leave,We were so frustrated and angry we told call them and let them decide who's wrong here.Then he told that club rougue owner(MD) is NARSINGH RAO and he is a big local goon and he threatened us that once u leave this place some unknown people will come and hit and break our bones if we say anything to SIDDHARTH (the manager).People go to clubbing to have fun and in the end all we got was a life threat.And moreover this place became a sick place,it stinks and waiters will force u to give more tip saying 2 ppl served u and all.And the cheap guy stags who come inside with influence and think they are hottest models üòÇ.Sorry for the long review but i think they deserve it.The manager SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH Thanks for making me realize that i should never come back to club rougue and make bills around 20k each time I visit the club.And thanks for making me realize that I should not suggest this place to anyone.His name is SIDDHARTH and the he is HERO of club rougue."
Club Rogue,Sai Charan,25 March 2019,4,great place with great vibes. I can give thumbs up to service and food. The only drawback of this pub is the DJ. Over all great experience and fun.
Club Rogue,Swarna Gattu,24 March 2019,1,"Bad reception and unprofessional staff,do not visit this place they are unfriendly they just loot your money and the prices are also very High"
Club Rogue,Varsha Ane Nenu,24 March 2019,1,the manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly. And called bouncers upon us coz We justed wanted to see the match. The reception is bad. No ethics at all
Club Rogue,Vishnu Bharadwaj,24 March 2019,1,"The manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly and called bouncers upon us. The ethics, courtesy and reception were very bad."
Club Rogue,HarshaJ Harry,24 March 2019,1,Went to this place to watch ipl match which was at 4pm and once happy hours ended they told us to leave.There were more 10 overs left and they told us to leave.Then manager came and he shouted at us and he din tell his name also.We told we will leave after match he called 6 bouncers to send us out.He was shouting as hell and abused us.I have been to many clubs but this kind of attitude that too in a cheap place like club rougue is lame af.Please ignore this club if u wanna have a good time
Club Rogue,Sai Kiran,24 March 2019,1,"Me and boys went to watch match here, we are regular customers here. But manager asked us to leave abruptly in between the match. He called bouncers upon us which was totally unnecessary. Can't have a good time here. Won't recommend this place."
Club Rogue,Sonal Kathel,24 March 2019,2,Too crowded.. Don‚Äôt even have place to dance. Music is good but since it‚Äôs too crowded you won‚Äôt be able to dance.. They should manage the crowd to make it good
Club Rogue,Subro.matt,24 March 2019,1,"So this is not the review for good music/ambience/food/drink.
This is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd March, 2019. We were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company ID, as we were stags. One of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his ID proof.
In the mean time that Manager appeared at the gate.
We went to the gate and showed the ID, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. Without any reason.
Some other stag groups were entering; just showing company ID.
But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.
We didn‚Äôt make any nuisance there, and silently left the place.
So , tell me Club Rogue why this discrimination?
Is this the way your managers handle clients?"
Club Rogue,Neeraj Shukla,24 March 2019,1,"This is otherwise a good place, but all the waiters just always try to steal money by overcharging you for the items that you did not buy. This happened with me couple of times, they charge you for things you did not order, don't return the money and then argue with you.

I have seen this happen to others. Just be careful with the waiters and bartenders on this one, they seem to be bunch of thieves. This place is otherwise a good and joyful."
Club Rogue,Mounikadolly9,20 March 2019,5,"I was here with my friends ... ystrday was my 4th time .. every time we visited we had the best memories to take back.. the music and the dance floor are their plus point .. and the service too... the food here is reasonable
Best place to hangoutüî•"
Club Rogue,Laxmi Kanth,17 March 2019,4,"Over all good experience but

Cons: Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much. And also rude behaviour of bouncers. Instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

Pros: Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing. The way DJ plays music is awesome, He makes even non-dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing"
Club Rogue,Pooja Kale,17 March 2019,1,"1. Bollywood music starts only after 10.30 pm. Dont fall for the incorrect timings posted here. Before that, its routine boring music which is unnecessary loud and you cant converse
2. Theres no outdoor or smoking zone, so be ready for a lot of passive smoking
3. DJ is okay (we went there on a Saturday) not many latest songs in the list. If you're' a bit away from the dance floor, you wont hear the music properly.
4. Food & ambience & service is fine.
5. Drinks are below average. LIIT was okay.
I asked for fresh lime soda with salt only and even after returning once, i got it mixed with sugar syrup and without fresh lemon.
6. They serve wine and cocktails in cheap dirty plastic glasses. It totally put me off"
Club Rogue,Sandeep Vishnubhatla,17 March 2019,4,Good place to hangout on weekends..nice crowd..good music. The ambience is really good and also the service was quick. Just a suggestion if anyone else going here do book a table before hand or else with this crowd it‚Äôs impossible to stand as well
Club Rogue,Ishita Narain,10 March 2019,4,Good crowd and ambiance. Pre booking of table is highly recommended if you don't have plans of just drinking and dancing. The floor is big enough though the crowd outnumbers the capacity of it. Great place for a crazy weekend party!
Club Rogue,Ujwala Dindi,08 March 2019,4,One of the best places to hangout with friends. Ambience was good and cozy. Food was good. Service was appropriate. One of the happening place during weekends.
Club Rogue,Sthiti Pragyan Rout,07 March 2019,5,"I am very regular at this place. Infact this is the best clubbing experience I have. Though I tried other pubs but m so much attached to the ambiance, people and crowd. Every Sunday to Thursday free drinks for ladies. The food is amazing. Someone should definately try chicken drumsticks here. They are yum. I am in love with this place."
Club Rogue,Varma,06 March 2019,4,"One of the best looking places to hangout for an bar and the dance floor is quite decent, the ambience is so nice and should defiantly have a visit,

The food is decent and the set menu they serve for lunch is good, dont expect much from service"
Club Rogue,Runjhun Chandra,03 March 2019,1,Staff was very rude. Confused the order and asked our group to leave. Worst service staff I've seen so far in Hyderabad. STRICTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND.
Club Rogue,Paridhi Mehra,03 March 2019,4,"A good place to spend an evening with your gang of friends or your partner. Has good ambience, great food and drinks.

Few negatives about this place includes not being listed on zomato gold and sometimes it gets a little difficult to get a reservation specially during weekends. But overall a good place to hangout."
Club Rogue,Krishna Sai,27 February 2019,5,This place is awesome compare to the nearby restaurants in gachibowli Ambiance is 5/5.. must go place best time to enter is after 21:30 ....
Club Rogue,Dharnekiran8,27 February 2019,5,"We were there on a Saturday night and the place was crowded as obvious, the DJ played decent tracks and kept the crowd on the edge of their seats. We had a good time with the booze and the food. Be there on weekdays if you are looking to spend time with the friends. Wanna go crazy weekends should be your choice"
Club Rogue,Ujjwal Sachdeva,26 February 2019,3,"Everytime I go to this place, I‚Äôve experienced different experience. The staff is fine but I didn‚Äôt like the DJ. Only once I have enjoyed a lot with good music out of 5 times. A heart cup is far better than this."
Club Rogue,Rajarshi Biswas,23 February 2019,4,"Great food, awesome music!! Service is very fast and portions are apt considering the price. Staff demanded for tips, that was the only bit that was annoying. But rest was an amazing experience!!"
Club Rogue,Siddharth Bhayana,23 February 2019,1,"The DJ that came on around 11 PM yesterday night (some lady) was a terrific disimprovement over the guy who was playing right before she. Killed the buzz for us entirely (and for many others, too, visibly). Liked the ambience, though. Would want to visit again iff the same DJ never presents themselves again."
Club Rogue,Priyanka Chandak,22 February 2019,1,So unprofessional place being a girl I felt the staff was inappropriate on behaviour and I love the Dj anyways over there but the staff is making the place worst so freaking rude
Club Rogue,Abhinav Rakesh,22 February 2019,1,"They serve you wine in plastic glasses. Staff is very rude and unprofessional and they literally force you to pay exorbitant tips at the end. Was a loyal customer earlier, never coming back here ever again. Try 10D or the lal street instead (in the same building)."
Club Rogue,Akhil Kumar,21 February 2019,5,"I guess have been here for almost 10 times. Every week when Friday comes I really miss club rogue. It has become like my permanent place for freaking out!! Everything is awesome here you just name it weather it be food, Serivice , ambience anything picture perfect."
Club Rogue,Shantanu Paul,20 February 2019,1,"Visited the place on a weekday but it was jam packed with people. The music was too loud to the point that we would not able to discuss on what to order across the table. I have been to many places but never had such loud music. My ears were ringing after coming out.

The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. This was pretty humiliating. This place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to.
The food was average at best.
They entered ‚Çπ200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this s***ty service.
The valet meddled with my car's infotainment system.
I will avoid this place from now on and stick to more classy places."
Club Rogue,Sharleen Phlpz,20 February 2019,2,"The staff is not at all friendly As we entered we asked for place and no one even responded to us order was taken after almost an hour and the straight no answer it‚Äôs very rude added they don‚Äôt have half of the things in menu available. Place being popular amongst the crowd even on weekdays must ensure to meet the menu mentioned food items and sometimes we specially come to try those food items and also serving cold food is a big disappointment
So I think if the place gets the humbleness and little more friendly it would add on."
Club Rogue,Mayur Gangwal,20 February 2019,5,"This place is in the SLN terminus mall...it's a huge place with young IT crowd of hitec city pouring in...very good place, nice ambience and setting, food is good and the party scene is electrifying"
Club Rogue,Sheetal Adapa,19 February 2019,1,"I am thinking where to start, there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2-3 hours of time we spent there. We were a group of 8, we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us.
To start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
Secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
The service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.
The Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said ""Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
Our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
This place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever."
Club Rogue,Vikrant Nakhate,17 February 2019,3,Greetings. The ambience is good ( okayish! ) with artificial plants towards the gallery area. Too dark for a pub. Sitting is good. Dedicated Dance floor with good Hindi new and old songs to garnish upon. Too loud though. Don‚Äôt have draught beer. Have pint prices slightly towards higher side. Crispy corn made the day ( night! ). Do try!
Club Rogue,Pranay Agarwal,15 February 2019,4,"this place freakin crazy lil fuzzy over crowded but crazy mood changer enterin it changes all ur mood

food 4/5
service 4/5
ambience 4/5
musix 4/5

visitin is repeated for me"
Club Rogue,Sudhakar,15 February 2019,3,"Rocking club....
But where is my Bro....DJ ASIF IQBAL
WE WANT ASIF
WE WANT ASIF
WE WANT ASIF
WE WANT ASIF
WE WANT ASIF
What a music
What a class Man..."
Club Rogue,Maria.cancer78,15 February 2019,4,"Hello...
The ambience is amazing..and the food is awesome...
But this friday i literally came for Dj Asif Iqbal...
But it was an utter disappointment...he was Not there...some other dj was there..To be rather frank..i come to this club coz of Asif's music.It is so mesmerising...We missed him..
What a talent..
He is a rockstar
Where is ASIF IQBAL..
Hoping to see him this coming Friday..."
Club Rogue,Aditya Reddy,13 February 2019,1,Worst place in Hyderabad. Staff has no etiquette‚Äôs to talk to customers. No idea about what is available and what is not in their drinks menu. Takes more than 30 minutes to get your order. Horrible experience
Club Rogue,Amlan Dutta,13 February 2019,2,"Ambiance is good. There is a dance floor with a good DJ. Food and drinks quality is good and price is ok! But service is very bad, stuffs are not at all polite and not cooperative. Even they force to pay tips and use to bargain for the tips which is very unprofessional. We did not find any manager as well.."
Club Rogue,Vaishnavi,11 February 2019,3,"My friend gave his birthday treat here! We opted for the buffet going on there. Buffet was not that great! Buffet had one chicken starter one vegetarian starter one main course (we opted for non vegetarian option) choice of roti biryani and Gilab jamun.
The ambiance was great. We clicked alot of pictures there! It was fun overall."
Club Rogue,Saurabh Lugun,10 February 2019,1,"Very unprofessional and rude staffs. If you order 2 beers, they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket, they will take half an hour to bring your order. The place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. Then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. Despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. Crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. Music and DJ is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller. One can have a really nice time if you can bear all these and if crowd is what attracts you."
Club Rogue,SrinivasKumarGoud,10 February 2019,1,"Very unprofessional and arrogant staff.
It takes 30mins to take order üôÑ
Staff is so careless towards customer. Ambience also not that much great. It's a chillar pub. Not recommend for couples.
Crowd is tooomuch because it's they allow stags aswell if you show your office id.
It's a budget friendly."
Club Rogue,Avishek Chakraborty,09 February 2019,3,"Well the service needs to be a bit organised. The staff is polite. But it's overcrowded place at weekends. Otherwise the pricing and ambience is quite good enough.
Cheers"
Club Rogue,Jaideep,09 February 2019,5,"An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

Closing line... Best hangout place in Gachibowli area."
Club Rogue,Aby C Alexander,07 February 2019,5,"A great place to hang out with your friends . One of the best pubs in the city . It‚Äôs a little highly priced but overall the ambience, music and food matches the bar. Great food and great music . Courteous staff and great service."
Club Rogue,Prashanth K,07 February 2019,5,"Ambience - 4/5
Food - 3.5/5
Service - 4/5

Hop on it's a nice place to hang on for some lazy lunch over and above they do run corporate offers very often which will save our pockets ."
Club Rogue,Hritik Sharma,05 February 2019,1,"This is the worst place i have ever been too.
Such a illiterate crowd and the management is too fucked up and i'll never visit this place and never suggest this place to anyone."
Club Rogue,SM,04 February 2019,1,"We were there in a group of 9, for drinks last weekend. And we had the most horrible experience ever. Happy hours were till 7, but they were very reluctant to take any orders in the last 30min.We had to call them repeatedly, and then they came dragging their feet. When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse. He outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us.. Really!?! LIKE REALLY???
Anyways we got the hell out of there and went somewhere else.. But it was a very unpleasant experience. Club rogue indeed has rogues running it. Would advise everyone to stay away."
Club Rogue,Parijat Ray,31 January 2019,3,The non veg starter items (specially chicken) comes on good quantity and are tasty too. The ambience is little shady. The service is satisfactory.
Club Rogue,Babier.f98,31 January 2019,5,"The place was amazing! People there were really polite
It was crowded af which was good.
The music could be better but it was a great night."
Club Rogue,Prashanth Ch,31 January 2019,4,"Awesome place with excellent ambience and pocket friendly prices , entry is restricted to couples and corporates on Saturday and Sunday during night."
Club Rogue,Raj Kumar,31 January 2019,4,"The ambience of the club is really nice. The staff are friendly and the best thing about Club rouge is the pricing, it is budget friendly for food and liquor."
Club Rogue,Deepak Banka,29 January 2019,3,"The music here is too loud even for a club. You can't hear what other person is saying even if they are speaking in your ear. Ambience is cool. Food is okay. I think the good thing about this place is that price is a bit low compared to similar places. And because of ladies night almost every day of week, you will never find the place dull and empty even on weekdays. Also I feel the dance floor lighting is bit too bright for my liking."
Club Rogue,Karna Haritha,27 January 2019,5,"It is one of the best places we have to visit in Hyderabad!
The food was amaaazzinnng....nd ambience was really cozy and great!!!and there's nothing negative about it it was a FABULOUS visit..."
Club Rogue,Sundeep Sethi,27 January 2019,1,"The worst place in the city, I was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours (which is till 6pm) and they were so adamant in taking our order at 5.50 stating happy hours were closed, we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price, surprisingly they didn't like it and the drinks were diluted. What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business. Disappointed!"
Club Rogue,Kiran Chinthakayala,27 January 2019,1,The place is not soo good. Staff is very arogant and doesnt care abt custor service. Initially they served drinks in plastic glasses and doesnt even have normal glasses to serve drinks. Manager is using abusive language when requested for normal glasses..
Club Rogue,Tanuj Malhotra,26 January 2019,4,"Not a regular to pub. We went with 4-5 colleagues on Friday evening. We landed around 7 and within an hour, crowd started flowing in...
Prices were reasonable and ambience was good. Service was good enough till it didn't get crowded. Had to get hold of staff member within this crowd.
Music was good.
Not much space left with so much crowd inside to dance....

A good place to try as its inside SLN Terminus and stores around for shopping..."
Club Rogue,Phani Varma,24 January 2019,4,"I have been here last night and for sure this is one of best places to hangout in the City. Have been to many Bars and have never seen prices like this . They are very moderate and Ambiance is very good.
Over crowded for sure . May be this would a big issue here.

Food is nice , DJ is good and with a dance floor this place rocks if you want to go mad and forget yourself dancing . 

Sound system would be very loud and prepare for that if you want to visit."
Club Rogue,Sai Sree,24 January 2019,4,"visited this place recently... its a good place.. the food tastes good and service is good, friendly staff.. mocktails didnt taste good but over all the place can be visited again üòÖ"
Club Rogue,Pukhraj Singh Gurjar,23 January 2019,5,"Waaw, have been there almost every fortnight but aura remains same, pure 5 star pub within its locality. Food,music, crowd this would definitly meet with your expectations."
Club Rogue,Vrushabh Gaidhani,23 January 2019,4,"Good place to hang out and relief from your stress.
Good Music, excellent Dj.
Please try: Crispy Corn, chicken tikka kabab
Best of luck guys."
Club Rogue,S√•i T√™j√•,22 January 2019,5,It was absolute fun here. Really loved the ambience and atmosphere.. service and people working here are awesome. Location is ideal for a chill out.
Club Rogue,Saurabh Chalana,21 January 2019,5,"great ambience...dj is superb..food and service good..pocket friendly club to go ..convenient location.. have tried a few items, i think their crispy corns is really good..great place to hang out with friends..must try for everyone"
Club Rogue,Doyel Maiti,19 January 2019,1,"Worst experience ever. We were three girls and waiters were rude as much as possible. They even denied to accept orders and it was just our second order.
Never seen such a pub run by rude and unprofessional people."
Club Rogue,Prashanth Kodhumuri,19 January 2019,1,"It's a pocket friendly but not a customer friendly club. Have been here with my friend and I see the staff was busy with own works rather than offering a menu card. When the same was raised with the manager, he was very arrogant asking us it can't be changed.
The place is a definitely a crowd puller but they should remember that even the best clubs go down the pecking order as the time goes.
Never going to visit this place again."
Club Rogue,Keval Kumar,18 January 2019,3,"Ambience was good but when we were drunk , the waiter has charged extra 100 on our bill. Please ask the management not to misuse the customers"
Club Rogue,Priyal Baradia,18 January 2019,4,"Place was pretty good.We went on thursday nite and it was almost full .Dance floor is quite good as compared to other places and nice place to party .We loved the food here, not over priced and taste wise it was great. Somehow i didn‚Äôt like the person serving us there, while billing he was forcing to add tip for 300-400 atleast and was not getting concinced in small amount . Managers should take a control over that.
Otherwise a must visit place :)"
Club Rogue,Indrajit Ganguly,17 January 2019,4,"Amazing place.. If you visit at day then this place has an entire romantic environment and if visit at night then this place gonna rock your night!!! Service is good... Music has a standard... Foods are okay. Dance floor is nice too.. Best is architecture of the pub !!!! However the staffs are insisting for 5% tips, which I didn‚Äôt like..!! Otherwise good... Hence 4 star otherwise it deserve 5 star..!!"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Anu,24 May 2019,2,I am a big soup fan and both hot and sour and tomato soup was disappointing. The starter was too paste like in the mouth. The garlic naan was amazing. Daal makhani was below average. They gave us complimentary brownie and ice cream which was average as well. Definitely not a place worth your money.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Gautam Gada,18 May 2019,4,"Lovely ambience. Felt relaxed. Service could be more prompt ....
The roof top besides the pool and the entire view of the city is mesmerizing."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Navdeep Kohli,17 May 2019,5,"This intimate and cozy restaurant is located in the Gachibowli area .  The service is quite good, with all servers being polite and efficient .  Ambience of the place is breathtaking and perfect for having group , corporate events or a romantic evening.

This place is so good, that I've been there three times in under a month.  
Pasta arabiatta is one of my favourites with the right amount of sauce and seasoning which makes it a perfect dish for all occasions.  The homestyle chicken is also very delectable and mouthwatering.  All the flavor is kept in while cooking and goes well with a good cocktail .

The prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places.
A must go place to chill and relax with friends or family."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sunshine,14 May 2019,4,"Was here for Sunday brunch, the view was great üëçüèª the pool sky... u can sit inside the restaurant or by the pool side... the spread was really good they had really wide variety of options in food and desserts üçÆ they had live counters in that I really liked tempura fried prawns üç§ and vegetables the starters the main course was really delicious the desserts r really delicious üòã . The staff r courteous"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Ananya G,12 May 2019,3,"Went there for my husband's birthday.

We ordered fish and chips and Basa fillet.
In both the dishes the fish were not served fresh.

Service was not that great either as it was the busy hour and only one server was seen trying to serve everyone.

Ambience is excellent as one side of the hotel is the botanical garden and the other part is the hi-tech city. A beautiful contrast.

Food: 2
Service: 3
Ambience: 5

Will I visit the place next time ?!?! Yeah, may be for the ambience and no ""fish"" dish. :)"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vamsi Thota,12 May 2019,3,"Wanted to checkout this new place and this visit we visited Mazzo and opted for A‚Äôla Carte. Overall only the Drinks, Soup and Fish and Chips were good, service was good. The value of food experience was not satisfactory and I wouldn‚Äôt visit next time.

Asian Clear Soup Chicken - Just Warm
Sweet Corn Soup Chicken - This is better than Clear Soup
Lamb Pepper Fry - Cold, Rubbery, No Sign of Pepper, Tasted like South Indian Dry Chicken Curry
Roasted Spring Chicken - Tasted Bland due to thickness of Chicken Breast
Fish and Chips - This was decent enough

#Chicken #Fish #Lamb #Dinner #Wine #Scotch"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Ghanashyam HS,12 May 2019,3,"Went for my birthday dinner on Friday night here with my wife
Ambience is good. But food is very ordinary.
We ordered only 2 items, fish and chips, and sea bass fillet with vegetables. Both of them were not fresh.
Service was not stand out either.
Overall a very meh experience."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Priyanka Naidu,10 May 2019,1,"This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.

So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg & Non-Veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.

Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. 

1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. 
2. The livery was stained.
3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.
7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.
8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi. 
Lamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
Nalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.
Murgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.
9. And last but not the least, Dessert.
Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
Kesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. Ate 4 and went home."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sunil Khatri,09 May 2019,4,It's a romantic place. Pool side wine on 10th floor gives a feel that deserves a high ratings. don't try food as we were only for the ambience and the feel of Hyderabad breeze with wine.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Nikhil Naik,06 May 2019,5,We wanted to have small reunion of our old colleagues and being friday it was difficult to get any quite place so we talk and send some quality time. Friend recommended Mazzo but the time we came the pool side area was full but we requested after sometime the staff arranged a place near the pool area. The ambience is very beautiful and romantic. On the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to all. Food was very tasty and filling. After ages I must have had so tasty and upto the mark Rogan Ghosh. I would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time. The only 1 part I would suggest as improvement will be the wait area for giving the order and receiving the food on the table...rest it was a beautiful experience.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vidushi Mittal,04 May 2019,4,"On the B-day I was looking for a place which has outdoor/poolside sitting and after searching lots of places around including Prego which I also like, Mazzo by Marriot came up in the results while Zomato-ing and I thought why not to give it a shot. . Anyways, this place was in my list since long to explore but I was looking for an occasion or right time to visit and what could be better than a dinner date on your birthday! ...

It is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside.. Basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live IPL and indoor seating arrangement with some light music.loved their ambiance..

My review is based on session invite..

Soup - coconut Thai soup which was amazing..It has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and Thai spices were enhancing it's taste to the next level..

In starter, We tried beetroot paneer Tikka which was damn good..Paneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney .Taste wise it was good..

Sikampuri kebab - This was show stealer dish of the day..It was stuffed with many ingredients like casher,potato, capsicum,green peas, onion, khoya, kismis and the list goes on..It was luscious..MUST TRY

Mocktails,
Mango mint - It was one of the show stealer Mocktail..The hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing...

Apple cooler - it was sundowner Mocktail..Very refreshing..Apple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink.

In main course,

Stuffed capsicum - This is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste.. .. Capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate.. Loved it and I would like to day plating was damn attractive..

Malai kofta - lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravy..Kofta was stuffed with paneer, khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet side..It lip smacking good..

In Desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balanced..It was heavenly good .

My overall experience was amazing..chef Bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning time.Mr.Nitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable... I would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too... Loved their hospitality..

I would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and Ambiance.."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Karthik Yamsani,29 April 2019,5,Amazing pool side table was given to us. Hospitality of executive Gopal singh is very good as he took feedback frequently and gave us interesting options available. Looking forward to visit this place again. Great place for couple to have dinner.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Naimish Chandarana,27 April 2019,5,"Instagram | veganyums_

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.

We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.

In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.

In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.

Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.

Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vinya Reddy,26 April 2019,5,"I have been here for my BF birthday and the ambience was really gobsmacking although we have already booked a table adjacent to pool in prior.I must say this is one of the finest roof top in Hyderabad .The place is sumptuous and perfect for a date
The staff was really friendly and available all time over all it was a great experience for us.

Coming to food ist was good and worth the price
As I was on a birthday occasion we got a complimentary browine from the team.

If you are looking for a pool side space and need to be seated outdoor I recommend you to book in prior.

Over all it was really a great experience üëçüëç"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Anil Kumar Pradhan,24 April 2019,5,"This is one of the best place to celebrate any occasion specially with your spouse. We were here on our first marriage anniversary and we were spellbound with the pool view ambience. Mr. Gopal Singh helped us in the food serving and was great help all together. Food is average but no comparison to AMBIENCE. To conclude with, it‚Äôs an amazing experience."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Havish Gadepally,23 April 2019,5,"Great place to unwind, hot and sour soup is not recommended and Biryani is must try.. may be menu can have bit more options specially on Indian Cuisine....

Vikrant was very helpful in giving feedback to chef and getting less spicy food for kids...

Ambience .. Best in City!!"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vandana,22 April 2019,5,"Today I had an awesome experience at Mazzo @Marriot. We wanted a lot of customization on the food and our Chef @Aritra personally made sure that our food was above our expectations with those intricacies taken care of. It was just a pleasure to talk to him as he himself became our host for the evening.
1. The ambience beside the pool was great2. Great hospitality starting from manager to our Chef and the person who attended to us.3. Great view4. Our chef made our evening by adding his suggestions and giving us a discount too.5. Food was great
Great place to visit with family and special person."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Ritish Kumar,21 April 2019,5,"I had been to this place on a Sunday evening, it was calm and pleasant not too crowdy. They gave us the table of our choice.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Abdur Rahman,21 April 2019,4,"Anyone looking for a place on the rooftop with a great view.
this is the best place for that.
Ambience is on point.
The view is amazing. i think its the 13th floor.
there is a pool on the outdoor section.
which has an access to the people on sundays.
My experience was really good.
the staff was very polite .
when dining in a 5 star one cannot expect much from the food on taste basis.
but i think.
by far the best i have had.
buffet spread is good. they can add more drinks though.
just one drink wont be sufficient.
but overall its worthy for a good lavish dinner."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vineela Kuruva,19 April 2019,2,"Ambience wise it's the best rooftop place one could possibly ask for. The behaviour of staff however is highly disappointing. They have this bad attitude as though you're blessed to be dining there, now that certainly isn't accomodating, is it ? In fact, it ruined the entire experience despite the place being amazing and food being great. I guess it really is important to keep tabs on whom you're hiring."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sumedha,18 April 2019,4,Gopal Singh.. was very polite and friendly..the place is really very good can .enjoyed alot leisuring with family ..food is tasty too though only limited vegetarian options
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Avin Seth,16 April 2019,5,"Amazing place to be with the one you love on a romantic date. Spent my first valentine after marriage over here by the pool side having dinner. The food tasted great. I would say its a place to make memories and go down the memory lane everytime u visit this place. Guys go and have fun and make memories at mazzo

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Kiran Tanwar,15 April 2019,3,Giving three stars only because of the good staff and the amazing ambiance near the pool. Completely disliked the food which I felt was half cooked and tasteless.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vivek Rachamalla,14 April 2019,5,"The place is awesome with swimming pool on the roof top. It's my first visit to Mazzo , liked the ambience, good. Service.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Maurya Dutta,14 April 2019,5,"Greart place. Aritra was of great help. Too nice. Great servers. Kudos to Aritra and others. Will come back for sure. Too good. Best in the city. Above all, pool was brilliant. Nice concept. Food was top class"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sabir Khan,12 April 2019,5,This was my first visit to Marriott executive apartments Hyderabad and Here I got one of the best food I ever ate and the service provided was amazing. I Would truly thank chef Amit from Mazzo for the wonderful experience and would surely come back soon..
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Lavanya Vijaya Kumar,11 April 2019,5,"I came first time at mazzo. It was excellent poolside restaurant in Hyderabad.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Muthu Kritisha,11 April 2019,5,Really loved the ambiance and food. Thanks to chef guru and chef bhuvanesh for delicious offering.Evening very well spent with my kid. Planning to do my daughter's birthday here
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Akshay Krishna,10 April 2019,1,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Saloni Singh,10 April 2019,3,"The ambience was really nice, rooftop view makes it for a quiet romantic outing, the staff were nice. But the food was served cold and wasn't up to to the Marriott standards. Breathtaking view and the quaint corner near to the pool balanced our entire evening."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Akshay,09 April 2019,3,"This place has an awesome ambiance, it is really worthy to spend money on this place. It is the best place to chill out with girlfriends üòú but the food it just average"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sheik Reshma,08 April 2019,1,"It‚Äôs true that ambiance is good, but the staff has failed to direct me to the restaurant. Though I requested to book a poolside table they didn‚Äôt reserve, only the buffet people will have access to it, it seems. Food was good. But the staff was not professional enough."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Siva Kumar,03 April 2019,5,"Ask for a five star experience..will sing this experience for lifetime..
Ambience-(10/5) I was awestruck. Everything related to this place was awesome. The pool side was international standard. The view would ease all the tiredness which you ever had. The place would bring a certain calmness which you would cherish for very long time. I thought my Paisa wasul from this ambience itself.

Food-(4/5) Everything in the buffet was good. Starters Tikka n roll was really good. The welcome drink was also really good.

Service(5/5) They have certain standards and they really live up to the reputation. Really enjoyed their hospitality.

I suggest everyone to have the experience of the wonderful ambience."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Nupur Saxena,01 April 2019,5,"First of all the ambience was just breathtaking, there was around the pool, I really like pool side sitting arrangement and light soothing music , very quiet place . Best for couples

Service was great and quick . The staff was very polite and humble . I really like the way they treat customers . You will definitely get a VIP like treatment there üòâ .

Coming to the food , we ordered chicken tikka, paneer makhani and naan . All the three dishes was great . Perfect combination of all spices neither too much nor too less , just the Right amount of spices and other stuffs.
In drinks we ordered LIIT (Long island ice tea) and minty mango , drinks was also good.

This place was bit expensive but worth paying money."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Aman,30 March 2019,4,Amazing place with amazing view. You have to sit outside near poolside when you go here. Great drinks but average food. Amazing ambience especially with poolside table. Overall 4 /5.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Arun Tej,29 March 2019,2,"The only reason this place gets a two is because they‚Äôve got the best ambiance and the food in brunches is very very good. But trust me, they have to change their attitude towards the customers. We were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch. The reservation was confirmed, and it was all good until the brunch was over. We wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours. An hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they‚Äôve reservations. I informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. However, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. Here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. They made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. It was all EMPTY! I went to the manager and asked him if he can help us checkout, and confronted about the reservations. The manager now tells me to continue till dinner. I did not understand the issue they had and never bothered to ask too. We all left and agreed to never go back there again."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Prashant Sharma,28 March 2019,4,"Amazing place..the seating by the pool is beautiful.. excellent staff!

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Peri,25 March 2019,4,"This place is worth a visit! A rooftop with a pool - the ambience is just awesome, specially in the evenings. One of the best places for small parties/romantic dinners.
A good range of food is available. Have tried Thai curry and it‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve had."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Murali JB,23 March 2019,4,"Nice place to visit. Food is good exception of biryani, starters are preferable but it has an excellent view. Pool view is quiet enjoyable and just awesome."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Anjali Gupta,22 March 2019,4,You will love the ambience as soon as you step in. Good collection of cocktails and food make this place a must visit among others in Hyderabad. A great romantic getaway.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Aman Gill,21 March 2019,5,"Jaw dropping ambience!!

The place is on 13th floor, it has 2 sections open pool side and inside area. Pool side is the place where you should be sitting.

I ordered biryani which was pretty nice just that it's with bone and some extra masala's I could taste in it.
Must try Ice tea and chocolate milkshake!!

Staff is quite polite.
Valet parking
They don't take reservations after 9pm
Usually over phone they say the pool side is full but you'll get some seats available for sure.
The place is open 24*7"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Siddhant Chaugule,20 March 2019,1,"Ambiance is good..
Servers are courteous..
#FOOD is COLD & INEIDBLE ..QUALITY IS NOT GOOD and PATHETIC..
Walk in for drinks and the ambience, KINDLY FIND ANOTHER PLACE FOR FOOD if your really hungry.."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Dian Shmilev,18 March 2019,5,"Roof top restaurant with a great atmosphere. You feel like you are not in Hyderabad. Food is really delicious, cocktails are worth trying, especially Long Island Ice Tea. Waiters are friendly and helpful. Music in the evening is be a little louder than necessary."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Kaushal Vadlamani,17 March 2019,5,"Was here on a Saturday night for my dad's birthday. A wonderful place to spend an evening with your family and loved ones. The ambiance is calm and perfect. The staff is very helpful and understanding and will help you with anything you ask them for. The place is managed by Nithin and his courtesy and nature of serving the customer is just worth to note. Had a wonderful time, cheers."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sonal Ambani,15 March 2019,4,The buffet is good and rather than the ala carte. 10/10 for the decor and ambience. The service was quick. Beautiful view of Hyderabad. A must visit place.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vinaya Chekuri,15 March 2019,4,"Elegant ambience, can't say stellar but an interesting place. For its suave, it ought to visited.
Brownie tasted perfect. For a moment didn't know if it was really tasty or I was just hungry, my date voted the former idea. It was delectable anyway. üòÄ
Chicken Tikka Kebab was good enough for me as a first timer. Probably the second time, I may not stop appreciating the taste of kebabs at Bawarchis-Green, Red, Gold or VIBGYOR at each of those street corners.
I was optimistic enough to ignore consequences of only I among two of us decided to have buffet. Hope against hope perhaps, the guy said that we can't share from one buffet order. Voila, I also had to give up buffet. (I can't force the lady to have it when she wasn't keen about it.) Thatz the 4 stars, else an easy 5üå† experience.
Best place for photographs; one can cherish the look at Botanical garden, chunk of greenery with a silver traffic lining from the rooftop.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Shailesh Agarwal,13 March 2019,4,"The place is pretty beautiful with serene ambience with a poolside sitting.
The food was also pretty good but was disappointed with the biryani served as it wasn't hot but just a tad warm which certainly affected the taste.
The service staff were also very friendly.
Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice and a calm dinner with the loved ones."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Anjana Dandekar,13 March 2019,5,"Reach out to @thehedonisticbhukkad on Instagram for more! :)

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

Overall, dining at Mazzo is an indulgence. The prices might seem steep for some, but for the experience it provides, it is definitely worth a visit."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Satya Rama Varma Tamminidi,11 March 2019,5,"Visited 3 times every time enjoyed the food, tomorrow 12 th March again i am visiting to celebrate My Kids Birthday hope it will not disappoint my kid"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Jayadev Moturi,10 March 2019,3,"Been there for brunch, food is average at best. Ambience was good and service also pretty good. Aritra the staff there was very friendly.
The place has a lot of potential, lovely view and swimming pool area. They should improve food and also the menu itself."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Abhishek And Moumita Ghosh,09 March 2019,5,Too good..food taste is really awesome...taste was really awesome...Amit..one of the cooks was really nice..really enjoyed..went to celebrate 11 years of togetherness..thanks Marriott..will come again
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,T R L,07 March 2019,4,"Hyderabad's best rooftop as of now. With an unparalleled ambience, Mazzo is hands down the prettiest pool side eatery I have visited in town. Evenings here are absolutely beautiful, sunrises and sunsets are magical. Open 24/7 this rooftop will have you falling in love all around the year.

Ive tried their Sunday brunch. And it's an experience you don't want to miss. I won't exaggerate, the food isn't out of this world. It's decent. A respectable salad bar"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Ariema Singh,05 March 2019,5,5/5 for the ambience. The pool side tables under the starry sky is the best - super romantic. No complaints with the food. The bruschetta is great but only if you have a taste for English food with a sparkle of Indian touch.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sai Kumar,05 March 2019,5,"This was my first visit to this place. Hospitality is something that needs to be practiced and valued and Manager ""Mani"" mastered it! Received a warm welcome from the staff.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Aletimounikareddy12,03 March 2019,5,This place is amazing. We went for Sunday brunch and the food was really good .View and the ambience was awesome. Would definitely recommend for those who want to have lots of food and relax and have a perfect weekend.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Debangana Tarafdar,27 February 2019,5,"Mazzo, located on top of SLN Terminus, is the dining wing, for Marriott‚Äôs modern extended-stay apartment hotel.
Marriott is known for it‚Äôs hospitality, and you will experience that, here at Mazzo.

I went to Mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. The view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking.
I could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.

I had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! I had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, Amit, for getting everything so right.

I had Indian Shorba and Fish n Chips for starters; Pork Chops and Spaghetti Carbonara for my main course; and a Brownie with icecream for desert.

Every dish was fantastic. But the Fish n Chips and Pork Chops blew my mind.

The fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.

The Pork Chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. And, how can I forget that demi-glace sauce. Beautiful!

The spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.

Plating was just so Marriot! Elegant yet simple.

And, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.

A heartfelt thank you to the team at Mazzo, for putting together such a beautiful meal."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Eat Like Jo üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥,27 February 2019,5,"Such a special night to remember when we decided to dine in for a midnight dinner at the beautiful poolside restaurant at Marriott Hotels. We had made the night special and Marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too. We had our hands on few cocktails namely Eye of the tiger and Bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night.
The Chicken and Thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste. Hands on this was the best compared to any pasta I tried in restaurants at Hyderabad. Absolutely wonderful.
Wok tossed Hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it‚Äôs called a Hakka. It purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was. At above ‚Çπ400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel.

Food-5/5
Ambience-5/5
Service-3/5
Value for money-4/5"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Saugat Roy,25 February 2019,5,"This is one place where one can spend a Lowsy Sunday. Mr. Nitin was courteous enough to welcome us when we reached Mazzo. The first view which attracts everyone is the pool side arrangement. As i am a hard core non vegetarian the live counters attracted me the most. The Macrail and pork were the best starters of the lot. Chef Aritra was courteous enough to come and check for the taste of food. He also ensured that my son gets to taste the non spicy foods such as Japanese noodles and Murtabak. The cocktails served were also as per expectation.
The buffet lunch was good but we all were full to taste them. Desert section attracted my son, so we had few chocolate crossant and pastries.
Overall a great place to hang out with family and friends. Looking forward for evening visit now."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Kavya Reddy,23 February 2019,5,The food was very good and Tasty though there were limited options in menu. I liked the ambiance and service more. Best time to go would be in the evening.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Susmitha Yenugula,20 February 2019,5,"I will start off with what impressed me the most and go from there:

Service (5/5)
I worked with Nitin to host a wedding shower for my sister and brother in law, with a guest list of 30 people. Nitin was so easy to talk to and tried his best to accommodate all my requests. His staff was very courteous and even helped me when the decor team came to setup. At the party, they were attentive to all my guests and followed instructions well. Nitin even provided me with a speaker so I could play songs during the party. There are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party, but the location and the staff were not on that list. It is a genuine relief that I had Nitin and his team to help me.

Ambience (5/5)
The location is PERFECT if you want to host a party, take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a Friday evening after work. Good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is - the rooftop, the pool, the bar, the lounge chairs by the pool, the lighting at night, the city views. 

Food (4/5)
I created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from Nitin. Mazzo has a HUGE menu you can choose from if you're hosting a party. I for one was confused with all the choices but Nitin's suggestions were well received. Appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good. They even have the option of live stations - pasta, Mongolian, chaat etc. Overall, diverse options."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Rakshit Agarwal,18 February 2019,3,"Went there for dinner with family,it's located just above SLN Terminus.
Must say it has a terrific ambience and decor, especially loved the poolside view of the place,but the food is strictly average and their service is terribly slow and a big let down."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Alice S Iased,18 February 2019,5,"Absolutely stunning! From their customer service, ambience to food! From the get go, The Manager Nitin was helpful and assisted me in organizing an awesome Couple Shower for my Sis and her Partner! They let us have the best spot by the pool, let us decorate, served us entree at the table and set up speakers for us play our own music! Their service was impeccable through out that night. Thanks Mazzo & Nitin for helping me to make it memorable for my sis and her now husband!

Just look at those happy smiles!

Cheers and keep up the stellar service!

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Diwakar U R S,13 February 2019,5,"Of all the places I have ever been, Mazzo stands on the 2nd place. With the amazing view of the city and open air dining area, this place definitely leaves a great impression in people's mind. Variations within the available type of cuisines, this is a place for everyone. The service was fantastic. The food was really amazing. Salads really melt in your mouth, especially the Woldrof Salad. A connoisseur will have no second thought in choosing this place. As they say, good food goes well with good wine, you have a bar with a wide am variety of drinks. People will love this place. I say it's a bit pricey, but hey, good quality comes with a high price...

Thank you Mazzo. It was an amazing feeling to eat here."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sanjana Sridhar,12 February 2019,3,Reservation was confirmed on the phone multiple times as I was hosting a group of 20 people but we didn't have a table when we reached. I was told that I spoke to one employee but the other employee didn't know so its not his responsibility. I however contacted the hotel so not sure how I am supposed to inform ALL employees for a simple reservation. It was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well. The staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed. This was a corporate booking with colleagues so we would not have expected this to happen
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Debabrati Sonia,07 February 2019,3,"The place has an amazing ambiance, nice seating at rooftop beside the pool with amazing view. And all 3 stars goes for it. But the food is not great at all.. u can go there just to enjoy the view, but food a big NO.. the biriyani was very dry, hardly any options for starters or desserts. The staff were extremely courteous and srrvice was also okay."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Hezy Long,06 February 2019,5,"Sunday brunch can't be better than in this place.The food,the drinks, ambience and the view- it's all WOW.I had my share of awesome drinks and splendid time that I hardly clicked any pictures.

I tried the thursday menu as i went on a thursday , they served me yummy kodi fry, kodi curry bagara rice , and yummiest smeiya paisam with a moctail (strawberry) i had the best time i m sure u guys will too :)"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sidhant Dhirsamant,14 January 2019,5,"Revised Review:

It was an absolute delight to be at Mazzo. The view is something worth looking forward to. It‚Äôs probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in Hyderabad. After a not so pleasant first encounter, I decided to give it another attempt. And boy, this time, it was definitely worth.

We were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. Soon after we were served with Fried Papad to nibble on and Cranberry Base Mocktail to give some company. The poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.

A little later, the Hot and sour soup arrived. It was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later. For starters, we had Veg Manchurian and Paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. The Veg Manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. And the Paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft Paneer cooked in real balanced masala.

We, then got in Veg Lasagne and Veg Biryani for main course. The lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that I had earlier. This had a very different taste, I‚Äôm not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. And it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. The Biryani, as usual, was good. Accompanied with this was the Apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time I had a sip.

The best was saved for the last. Although, we were full to the brim, I couldn‚Äôt leave the beautiful Rasmalai untouched. And of course, there‚Äôs always a separate stomach for desserts, so. 

Overall, I had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. And I recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you‚Äôd have a sublime time, regardless of who you‚Äôre with.

Old Review:

Overall Rating - 3/5

Such a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. Me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. I was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. We asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. The menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. We ordered in a Subz Shammi Kebab to start with. The staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (I guess). Due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a Salted Lassi and a Hot Chocolate. I don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. Both the drinks had thin consistency. We then went ahead with the Vegetable Biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less. 

I'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. But, to be perfectly candid, I don't think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. Definitely, not worthy enough."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Eben Paul,13 January 2019,5,"I have been a regular here @ Mazzo. Evereybody that has ever accompanied has fallen in love with this place. I would like to point out one special person ""Sudhakar"" he is the chef. A very polite and cordial gentleman, exactly sets the mood by dishing out the most mouth watering- smacking dishes. I would like to give him 5 stars for making me every visit memorable"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Kiran Venkatarayappa,13 January 2019,5,Really we enjoyed food here .. thanks for amazing food .. love to visted again and to have a tasty .. Thank you sudhar for your tasty food you provide
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Robin Mukesh,13 January 2019,5,Awesome experience from the beginning. Amit and the manager was too customer centric. They had a private party ongoing and they still took care of us very well. My kid was feeling cold so they bought a shovel that was too kind. Zomato Gold was accepted without any issues. Ordered Long Island Ice tea which was perfectly mixed and Margarita was Awesome. They served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks. They checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and TASTY food. Lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday. Definitely going to recommend this place for perfect and tasty food. Thank you Amit and the Manager on duty
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sambhangi Sandeep,12 January 2019,5,"We loved the ambience to the fullest. Been here for my wife‚Äôs birthday dinner. Pool side/ lovely ambience/ buffet dinner - What else you want?
The buffet is simple and nice, nothing so great about the variety, but what ever they have - They are done well.

Amit and Pratik helped us and made us feel home. Thanks guys. Appreciate.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Virat Kothari,10 January 2019,5,It is one of the best rooftop places in Hyderabad. Wonderful ambience and pristine environment in addition to city view puts this place in a goto list. The place has an Amazing Poolside outdoor sitting to offer.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Vaishaliwow88,08 January 2019,3,"3 stars only for the ambience of this place. Its amazing !! For once, you forget that its actually in the city. Zero stars to the food though. We went for a sunday brunch. Limited menu and not so tasty food. Prawns were half cooked. To my surprise, drinks were good. Had apple Martini, which was really nice. But there are better sunday brunches in hyderabad than this."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Harsha Jonnala,07 January 2019,4,"The ambience is extremely beautiful and so are the service levels with the staff being healthily courteous and interactive
The chef is ever ready to customise the dishes to your liking
The drinks were below par in comparison to the other aspects of the place"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Kumuda Naidu,06 January 2019,3,"Starting with the ambience it has a warm indoor and a pleasant outdoor with a pool
Polite staff
Food of gd taste (chicken biryani a must try )
Very late service ; takes around 20 minutes though the crowd is very less !"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Srivatsav YM,03 January 2019,4,Till now its the best place for a perfect dinner date if you really have one üòâ. Food i rate it at 3.5 as pasta we ordered was half cooked but quantity was better than my expectations.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Surya.nandu.SN,31 December 2018,5,A perfect date place to go. Open top pool view cool breeze and delicious food with your loved ones is a perfect combination. Prawns fry is at its best. Service is great and kind and special mention to Arun who served us with patience.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sourav Datta,29 December 2018,3,"Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Gopi,28 December 2018,5,Nice place to spend with family great ambience warm welcoming great ambience of restaurants smiley faces quick service by service staff we will definitely come back to spent more time and same will suggest to my friends and family members.
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Raj Choubey,27 December 2018,5,"Okay, so finally I visited this amazing place I had heard so much of. The view of the city is really mesmerizing during evenings, the pool side view and the couple sitting area is one of their attractions.

Service is very slow which decreases their overall rating.
Food quality is good but not great. you can try white sauce chicken pasta, it will not disappoint you.
Ambiance is fantastic.
It's a costly affair so pick up only you have something special to celebrate.

3.5 rating overall, best is the ambiance rest you can get find it anywhere else."
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Priyanka Patra,25 December 2018,3,Visited on Christmas eve. I must say overall ambience is good. But buffet desert menu is limited and cost of the buffet must be updated on online zomato menu.(i.e online mentioned rate 999+ taxes which is actually 1200+ taxes)
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Siriisha Mulpura,17 December 2018,4,"The moment we enter in we will fall in love with the place ., especially in the nights .. great view , friendly staff and yummy food . Try their chat and cheese balls .."

Speacilly my favorite dishes chicken biriyani & mutton biriyani. I order one hundi mutton biriyani. But I am very discpointed for this biriyani rice not good. And mutton raw. After few minutes order mutton curry & zera rice. Same discpointed. For food not good. And taste bellow poor
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Hari Hara Sundaram,17 February 2019,3,Very nice Mandi. All Mandi r best but service for Briyani section is not good. Quantity for the price is best pieces in Mandi r best. Go with friend to eat mandi
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Pradeep,30 January 2019,5,There are very few places where you get the original aroma and the taste of Mandi and amongst them this is one... excellent packaging and taste of the biryani hope this continues!
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Furious Abbadi,17 January 2019,3,"Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad. They spread over Hyderabad. You will find any green bawarchi near your area.

Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants, they have crowd for taken away customers. We had take many times.

Coming to dine here. It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy. Roti and butter naan both were fine.

Pocket friendly. We can go with family and friends.

Food 4/5
Ambience 2/5
Service 3/5
Value for money 4/5

Overall an option to have food according to your convenience."

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Anupkumar,08 January 2019,1,I visited with my friends for dinner . It was a fake experience. Becos the sttaf behavior was like unprofession n rude .they don't know how to speak with the customer. No sense no manners nothing.
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Pramod Gatla,04 January 2019,3,"sorry for the late review , ordered for mutton biryani hundi taste was good but not great good quantity with the high quality meat , but they have to follow the instruction which the customer has placed i have ask them to give double spice but they did not followed . one thing for that the rating will be 3 will see in next ordered how they react to the instructions."

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Rahul Dogra,01 January 2019,4,Biryani tastes good service is little to improve. Will not say the best but better to go here if planning to eat biryani in Gachibowli area.
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Naresh Battul,30 December 2018,1,Very pathetic. Found two insects in the biryani. How one can eat such an unhealthy food. This is really unfortunate but they should also care about these things. I will not ever try again.

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Kaushik Padmanaban,09 December 2018,5,"This is the first place I experienced Hyderabadi Biryani. I walked in and ordered a chicken briyani. No big deal. The cost was nearly the same as in Chennai, about 200 bucks (I don't remember exactly, but it was around 200). I was shocked when the waiter came with a big serving of briyani. How big, you ask? Two people could share it easily. The taste was first class. I for one can handle briyani as much as you think, but I was stunned. It isn't the best briyani I've ever tasted, but its my first Hyderabadi Biryani and I loved it. Such a great experience."

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Big Bong Thali,03 May 2019,3,"Hello everyone ! We visited this place a few days back and tried their buffet . We were not happy with the quality of food served. The variation was good enough. There were 2-3 veg as well as non veg starters. The main course also had 2 veg and non veg dishes each . But the taste was not at all satisfying. We expect this place will improve in future ! üòä

If what you read is in any way helpful for you , do like the review and follow us ! We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ! üòÉ"

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Foodie Bookworm,01 May 2019,4,I was planning planning to go to the place since a long time and finally I went there few days back. The price we pay for the buffet is much lesser than the quality of food we received. Really impressed with the service too.
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Jayachandra Kanala,30 April 2019,5,"Food quality and taste awesome. Today tried butter chicken, tikka, biryani and butter naan. Roti with butter chicken is mouth watering. Gulab jamoon melting in no time. Best for the price"

Rotis and butternans are very good here
Mughlai chicken - not so spicy but tasted good
Chicken fry piece biryani - totally disappointed as the chicken was fried too much and biryani rice is okay in taste
Sides are good

Ambience is quiet bright and friendly
Staffa nd service are good
Price s of dishes is reasonable"
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Manisha Panda,11 March 2019,4,"Went for a lunch buffet a little while ago and found the place to be moderate.
Food here was good, only hoping for better choices.
I understand that providing buffet becomes a tedious task when everything has to be covered up under one roof so not complaining much.
Ambience wise the place doesn't have much to offer. But the staff was the sweetest.
There was this lady whose name I can't recall but she when I asked if I can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.
That gesture made me like the restaurant better.
PS. They don't really serve on banana leaves. üòú"
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Priti,07 March 2019,5,Great pocket friendly restaurant. We went for the buffet. There were good number of options. The food was great. Great for partying with group as it goes easy on pocket. Ambience is nice. AMust try place.

Everyday i am ordering carrot halwa from this restaurant. but a small suggestion from my side to the restaurant that is please don't add food colour.Its not good for health.

All the starters and main course are good in taste and quality, chicken biryani is one of the best made which I prefer to eat at least a cup only in this restaurant for buffet.

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Hemanshu Bhushan,30 August 2018,4,Veg manchurian was very delicious. The manager took our order personally and also the staff was very friendly. They took really good care of food preferences since we ordered jain food and I am quite surprised that they had so many options in jain food. Areas of improvement are the desserts which they serve in the buffet.

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Abhijeet Bebarta,11 July 2018,2,"I had taken Dinner Buffet. The ambience was good. The food taste and dishes were below average. Everything was self service even the starter. For Veggie people's, I would recommend not to go this restaurant as they don't have items in Paneer and Mushroom in Veg. Apart from this, they had dishes like Egg Burji, Egg Curry, rajma masala, plain rice(not even fried rice), Bhendi fry, etc. Such dishes gave me a feeling that I am dining in a roadside dhaba/tapri. Coconut Barfi, Ice cream was not at all special and seemed to be of low quality, The Pastries tasted as if they are preserved since many days. Overall I would say the buffet is a waste of money in this restaurant."

My son had a wonderful time and liked that he could order special food and the chef would make it so he could eat it. If you wouldn‚Äôt mind telling me how you prepared the fish, I would like to try making some for him at home, since he enjoyed it so much.He said that he wanted to have his birthday party at here!

My son and my mom enjoyed their desserts as well. Thank you also for having the special Jamoon for my son. I tried the sea foods and prawns was delicious!

Sea foods & Soups was amazing. Buffet was mind blowing

Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a great time, and you and your staff helped to make it that way! We will be back for my son's birthday! I‚Äôll be sure to let you know in advance before we come again.

Thanks again for all your hard work and consideration,"

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,17 June 2018,2,"This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.

The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.

One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

Ambience : 3
Taste: 2
Service :2
Value for money: 2"

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Apurva Ganesh,10 June 2018,2,"Good ambience.good spread, buffet for dinner yesterday night.Highly dissapointed about the vegetarian curries which were rottened, 2 out of three were rottened. The triple pudding in the deserts with rottened fruits was pathetic. Overall vegetarian food for the buffet was ignored by the restaurant. Pls do takecare #bananaleaf, don't dissapoint your customers."
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Boge Srikanth,06 June 2018,1,The worst biryani and tandoori I ever had! Looked like some leftover is delivered to me and so expensive. Idiots!

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Phani Nagendra,01 June 2018,1,worst food
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Shyam Reddy,01 June 2018,3,"Approach to the hotel could have been better (on the top floor of an old building with smelly ground floor), location could have been better (not very visible from the outside), lift could have been better (pretty old lift, not sure if it passes safety norms), ambience inside the restuarant could have been better (doesnot give you a good vibe)! Thats about the appearance and appeal. Spread was decent for a discounted price of 400 per person inclusive of all taxes, food was ok as well. I could see a lot of smiling faces (familes) and that sums it all. If food is good, then nothing else should matter I guess."
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Vishwa,30 May 2018,3,delivery very late more than 30 min
Kritunga Restaurant,Sarvade Divyanka Rajesh,17 May 2019,1,"The worst biryani i ever had in my life till date. I am sure kritunga biryani tastes good, hope this is zomato fault they have delivered me a local biryani instead kritunga, theres no kritunga cover when i got it, it was packed in a normal cover. The worst exp i had today"
Kritunga Restaurant,Sai Nadh Reddy,07 May 2019,5,"Nice food, good. Value for money. The food is much spicy as u like it most. It's quality and food smells very nice. The package also very neat and strong"
Kritunga Restaurant,ABHISHEK BERA,02 May 2019,1,"A complete and absolute disaster. The place where we sat was dirty. There were cracks on the walls. We ordered the food to be less spicy but I guess they cook how they want to cook. The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.  If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good. I think Kritunga Gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money. Wish them the best"
Kritunga Restaurant,Debasish Choudhury,30 April 2019,1,"I had ordered chicken dum biriyani...There is no chicken dum inside it also the chicken pieces are very small in size . I would also suggest to work on your food packaging ..
Very much disappointed with the quality of food."
Kritunga Restaurant,Sai Kumar,29 April 2019,1,"Hi,

I have ordered king of kodi pulao, Never expect too much from the title of the food. It is the worst thing I have ever eaten on this planet. The chicken is undercooked, The rice is giving a weird smell. As it is not cooked today. I have ordered Paya as well. I don't know if it is fat or oil but it's too spicy and oily. This is not the adept quality of Kritunga because I have been eating in this cuisine for more than three years. It's getting worse every year."
Kritunga Restaurant,Raghavendar Kandikonda,18 April 2019,4,"Food for only spicy lovers , be careful my dear mild food people.
Quantity was huge for one person if u r going with biryani, plan for two people"
Kritunga Restaurant,Ankita,15 April 2019,3,"We had picked up Sambar rice to satiate the craving for sambar daal. 
The dish was quite spicy to our tatse but tasted heavenly with curd as side dish. pretty easy on pocket too!"
Kritunga Restaurant,Abhishek Katta,21 March 2019,4,"Perfect place to taste Rayalaseema food. If you love spicy and eat well, this is the place. Raagi mudha with naatukodi pulusu (guthi vankai if you are vegetarian) is a must try. All the other items are also good."
Kritunga Restaurant,Naveen Kumar,17 March 2019,1,"Yesterday I have ordered biryani where in I found insect in my biryani and I‚Äôm trying to call restaurant till know no response. And by mistakenly I post my review kritunga palegars restaurant, where in I should post in kritunga restaurant"
Kritunga Restaurant,Venky Pawar,15 March 2019,1,Don't drink water in the given glass for more details please check attached images...:)Or ask for plastic glasses or take water bottle and drink with it only.
Kritunga Restaurant,Abhilash Reddy,03 March 2019,1,I‚Äôve been to other kritunga‚Äôs many times since 6 years and never was disappointed. Ragi sankati one of the benchmark dishes served by kritunga was bad and I‚Äôm hesitating to use the word worst. Pulavs weren‚Äôt good either keema pulao was below average and veg pulao wasn‚Äôt properly cooked. After receiving the order and started eating waiter says they ran out of soft drinks which we ordered. If kritunga really consider reading these reviews I would like to quote a statement ‚Äú kritunga you‚Äôre just selling your brand but not good food anymore‚Äù
Kritunga Restaurant,Pavanpentapaty,04 February 2019,1,"Ordered veg biryani. It is like rice mixed with red chilli powder. Not even tasty. Never order it.

Kritunga Restaurant,Aditya Kumar,03 December 2018,3,"I had ordered food from Kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once(Gachibowli). The ambience here is good and the staff was attentive.
The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes."
Kritunga Restaurant,Shravan003,01 December 2018,1,"The restaurant is not hygiene. All houseflies around. The staff especially the receptionist was rude when asked about the hygiene. Even if you order food, they don‚Äôt provide basic stuff like plastic spoon along with food. Totally disappointed with this restaurant."
Kritunga Restaurant,Leher Sadhnani,01 December 2018,4,"‚ÄùReasonable‚Äù

While going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for Ragi muda. Ordered one ragi muda, the quantity was good, properly boiled and happy to satisfy me. Have gone with many orders from this place.

Also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service, food and ambiance.

They have given it a old town look. Butter and Tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it. Little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place.

Again Ragi muda is my all time favorite from here, no doubt the chutney served with it is deadly spicy. But again you ask for some more ghee or take another curry."
Kritunga Restaurant,Sphurti Joglekar,28 November 2018,4,For vegetarians- They have amazing Ragi Sangati (Rice like ball made of Ragi) and Vangkaya(Brinjal made in coconut and nut gravy). The veg biryani was ok but my group really liked the chicken biryani! Recommended if you are looking for Andhra cuisine.
Kritunga Restaurant,Bheemu Arjunsaikrishnareddy,07 November 2018,4,"THEY SERVE WITH HOT AND YOU CAN ORDER SPICY OR LESS SPICY WHAT YOU WANT , IT IS VERY TASTE . SPICY NATU KODI AND MUTTON BIRIYANI IS VERY TASTE ....."
Kritunga Restaurant,JaiReddy,26 October 2018,1,Very bad service. People just roam around. Not even one gives a menu or takes order. Few don't know what's in menu. Tables aren't clean. Onion places got others finger prints with food.
Kritunga Restaurant,Vadde Venugopal,24 October 2018,2,Over Hyped place.No neatness. They open branches in hot places so that they will get the customers no matter what.Especially this DLF branch is no where preferable.

The Glass Onion,Varun Kuhad,21 May 2019,5,"Yesterday I was here with my two friends, it was raining and weather was amazing. The best fusion food I could ever eat. It's a must go place guys, I would rather say best place for romantic couples, good view, ambience of the restaurant, good yummy yummy food and silent music. The manager and people who were serving here are so polite and humble to suggest food and drinks. I would like to visit again soon.
üòçüòçüòç"
The Glass Onion,Dharma Teja Alaparthi,20 May 2019,4,"I liked the food very much. The best part is the ambience of it, you cannot ask for a better one in Hyderabad. It is so peaceful and one could spend hours sitting there. We had a hard time finding parking spot as the parking is full. Other than that, I loved this place and would go there again and again!"
The Glass Onion,Shashant Singh,19 May 2019,4,The ambience was very calm and soothing. Great view from the outdoor deck. Service was prompt by our server Mr. Anup. Food was absolutely delicious!! I recommend this place to try!
The Glass Onion,Manika Paliwal,19 May 2019,3,"It is a great place for a quiet dinner and ambience is lovely but the food was a disappointment.
the place doesn't feel like we are inside the noisy city which is absolutely delightful, but I wish I could say the same about the food and drinks!!
staff is courteous and serving time is excellent, you don't have to wait for your food or drinks for more than 10-15 mins no matter what you order.
Ambience: 5/5
Staff; 4.5/5
Food: 1/5"
The Glass Onion,Madhusha Urlam,19 May 2019,3,"Surprisingly the Sunset was an eye fiest. Evenings can be well spent. Feels like not in the City anymore. Quite peaceful and lovely ambience ü§©
Food is little disappointing though. Chicken is not at all spicy. But the Apricot Delight is a must try.
Go....have the most of the place with an Apricot Delight is what I can give 5/5 üòõ"
The Glass Onion,Ashish Paul,17 May 2019,4,"This was place was a surprise as it is better than you imagine. Though it turned out to be a bit hot, the air circulation could have been better. The food and drinks were as how they were described. Must try."
The Glass Onion,Arjun,12 May 2019,5,"The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.

Once you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.

The servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.

For the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.

Finally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.

One small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, I wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits."
The Glass Onion,Mr. Ego,12 May 2019,5,"Truly a hidden gem. This place is situated far from the city, inside Emaar courtyard. The have both indoor and outdoor seating, and the ambience is the best part about this place. Its just amazing.
The food was also great. Something that good be improved is the customer service. There is a bit of delay in getting the orders.
Top Picks :
- Mint Cooler
- Chicken BBQ Pizza

The ambience will offset the price you pay. Overall, a must visit place."
The Glass Onion,The Hungry Turtle,12 May 2019,5,"This place looks really nice with some good music. They have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it's a best place to hangout with the family and friends. Outdoor seating has an amazing view of the Golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening.

They welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
First we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.

Screw Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.

Tropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.

Mint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5

For Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5

Next we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5

Overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.

Overall - 4.6/5"
The Glass Onion,Pragati Magham,12 May 2019,2,"The place was in a very high end location. The ambience was not up to the mark. The service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions. And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the ""Classic Mezeh Platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response. Overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved."
The Glass Onion,Gaurav Agrawal,12 May 2019,4,"Visited glass onion a month back. The restaurant is very close to office, inside premises of Emmar boulder hills. We went with office colleagues on a celebration treat.

Ambience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.

Food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.

It was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.

For main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good. Deserts were good but served delayed.

Overall nice experience."
The Glass Onion,Saurabh Pareek,11 May 2019,5,"Place is cozy, peaceful and beautiful. Food is 4.5/5. Ambiance 5/5. Service 4.5/5. Good place to visit with family, friends or team. We tried their special nachos, 5 spice chicken kebab and Atishi murg tikka."
The Glass Onion,Jay Mehta,11 May 2019,2,"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar."
The Glass Onion,Divya,11 May 2019,4,"A classy place with fantastic ambience.The decor was lovely. A perfect place with indoor and outdoor seating options. Ordered Chicken wings- which were perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavours infused. Tempura prawns were okay. Can give it a miss. Lotus stem galouti kabab- mildly spiced, well cooked and melts in the mouth. Ordered Chettinad chicken Indian tray. It was amazing! Sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly. Ordered Goey chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu. Both of them were perfect.
VFM : 3.5/5
Service : 4/5
Food quality : 4/5
Ambience : 5/5
Music : 3/5 ( in the indoor seating area the music was too loud )"

The Glass Onion,ARJUN KAKKAR,05 May 2019,4,"Nice place to hangout with friends. Light Dj music. Good variety of fruit beverages. Margherita pizza is a must try. Chicken wings, chicken risotto and cheese broccoli"
The Glass Onion,Ashish Sharma,05 May 2019,5,"A memorable experience- would be the right caption for my recent dining experience with this restaurant. Staff was very courteous & proactive (special mention:- ankit & vishal). The restaurant has breathtaking views of the golf course around. The interior designing is another remarkable thing to notice.
Last but not the least - ‚ÄòThe Food‚Äô
I can still recall the tempting taste left on my tastebuds while stepped out that night.
MUST VISIT!! M definately coming backüòç"
The Glass Onion,Bhushan Maideo,05 May 2019,3,"I went there with my office colleagues. The ambience is good. The music played is little loud, may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking.

About food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.

We ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.

So, overall, good for one time."
The Glass Onion,Vibhor Dhote,04 May 2019,5,"I really like this place and I've been there multiple times. The best part is the ambience which is just really classy. You can bring your date here as they have that kind of a romantic ambience. On game nights you can watch live screenings of the matches too. They also have 2+2 on drinks for Zomato gold members, which is really nice to have as well."
The Glass Onion,Ganachariruchira,04 May 2019,5,"Had been here for lunch.
An amazing ambiance.
I tried the Italian cuisine.
My most favourite was the spinach ravioli, the best ravioli I have ever had.
Food - 5/5
Ambiance- 4/5
Cost- 4/5"
The Glass Onion,Pori Goswami,04 May 2019,5,"Talk about a perfect date night and The Glass Onion is the best decision to go for. With amazing music, perfect view of the golf course, beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering. The New York cheesecake (with blueberry sauce) was good, but I won't deny that I have tasted better cheesecakes before. We ordered one pizza which, was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two. Special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter (I apologize I don't remember his name, but he definitely needs some appreciation. I remember he said he was from Delhi and also Kolkata) who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert. This definitely made our night because it tasted so good. The menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes, it was not a hole in the pocket. Overall, it was an outstanding visit. A small suggestion, if they could include candle dining,that would elevate the romantic ambience of the place."
The Glass Onion,Harshet Agarwal,04 May 2019,3,"great feel, great ambianceterrible customer serviceU need a mesh and anti mosquito repellents ASAPwould not really want to be back after such an experience here

The Glass Onion,Sandeep Sahoo,01 May 2019,2,There were mosquitoes in the restaurant. The food was ok but there was a hygiene concern. The pickled carrot was stale and had fungus. The waiter replaced it but this is not expected of such a high profile restaurant.
The Glass Onion,Avinash Agarwal,01 May 2019,1,"The food is decent but the place and service is extremely horrible. Went there for dinner with my family and we were bombarded with mosquitoes all around us, even though we were sitting indoors. Called the manager for this situation and was told that they can't do anything about it. Brilliant customer service!"
The Glass Onion,Arpita,29 April 2019,1,Avoid this place in summer due to outside seating. They do not even have coolers in such weather outside and it is an expensive place. Not worth
The Glass Onion,Gautam,29 April 2019,2,"We visited the restaurant yesterday. We got outside table as all insides were reserved. Being 42 degrees outside, they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans. They are charging 1400 RS for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant. Quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers. Felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running around..I had same experience few months back. We went in th evening and it rained. We took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that. I liked the food here but if management can't simply think abt service, I am sure we can figure out other places to eat."
The Glass Onion,Richa Kulshrestha,29 April 2019,5,"Why Glass Onion üçöüçö: This place was trending on zomato ever since it has openned and it has gained the popularity in very short span of time. So, I was having an eye on it and finally felt delighted after visiting it at Saturday Nightüåô.

Ambience‚õ≤ : Oh Wobby !üòç Beautify ambience with indoor/outdoor sitting options and spread accross huge space. Its situated inside the boulder hills and hence the area is very peaceful and calm. You need to have a reservation for outdoors as this place is mostly filled with people

Service & Food : Super fast service and sumptous food. Period.
From Kung pow chicken , cheese based brocolli to Nachos to chicken chettinad , everything is lovely and you can go on asking more and more...üòå

Yay or Nay : üëçüëçüëç"
The Glass Onion,Amrit Acharya,28 April 2019,4,"I must say , Ambience is quite exotic and fancy. Food was well prepared . Have ordered different cuisines out of which Dan Dan noodles outshined. And in drinks the star was Afternoon fizz for us.

The Glass Onion,Chen Reddy Sundeep,27 April 2019,1,"Can improve your main course and desserts spread. I would have rated 3 but I am giving a 1 because one of your servers' behavior was bad in our office party. When my friend asked for a blue lagoon, he insulted him in front of everybody by saying that blue lagoon is for kids, not men... just because it's a soft drink. One need not believe in others' beliefs and customs, but at least respect them and not insult them. Train your staff appropriately."
The Glass Onion,Chandann Reddy,27 April 2019,5,Fantastic ambience and great service.... location is a must visit over seeing the golf course!!!! The food was great and meats quality was just superb..... will be a regular here!!!!
The Glass Onion,Nidhi Gupta,25 April 2019,4,"First time experience at this place was very good. Nice ambience, right from entry to the different seating areas offering different kind of ambiences. The food we ordered was also tasty. We had the veg Mezze platter and kungpao chicken as starters. Both were well made though quantity could have been a little more for the price they charge!
The main course was a custom made ravioli pasta in mixed sauce which was very good and a stir fry veg Udon noodles.

They can improve on service a bit as no one bothered to serve us food..not even first time!

Would like to go back again to enjoy the outdoor ambience next time where they played loud music..but looked like a good place to relax.."
The Glass Onion,Debashish Ray,24 April 2019,5,"Awesome food, great ambience, best service.

We went in a group and tried a lot of things on their menu, everything was unique and best. Cocktails were decent. Stallion stood out of all!"
The Glass Onion,Amlan Jena,24 April 2019,4,"I will start off by talking about it's ambience and location which I believe (and am sure most will agree) are it's highlights. Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills ,away from the hullabaloo of the busy city ,it offers a sense of calm. The simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in. It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. Now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality . The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have I believe this is a must try. Overall it's a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening , with family or friends.

P.S. Don't go there looking for dance and high pitch music, you might be disappointed."
The Glass Onion,Vikhyat Khosla,23 April 2019,5,"I don‚Äôt see how this place can be rated anything other than 5 stars.
Food, ambience and service, is awesome. There is no comparison to this place in Hyderabad.

I‚Äôve been served by Ani, he takes care of customers and suggests great choices from the menu.

Personal favourites - broccoli cheese kebab. Non veg kebab platter. Mezze platter."
The Glass Onion,Ramkesh Jhoorawat,21 April 2019,1,"All great except the staff. The service is quite poor and they made a lot of fuss about using zomato gold.
Lots of mosquitoes. Staff won't care to put some mosquito repellant either."
The Glass Onion,Eat Like Jo üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥,21 April 2019,5,"As far as date nights are considered there is music, lovely ambience, tables over looking a golf course and of course some rains to give you respite from the hot summer. This was my dinner night with Naina at Glass Onion, a beautiful restaurant at Boulder Hills, Hyderabad. The best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in Hyderabad.
.
Let‚Äôs take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. The beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. Lovely textures I must tell. Pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called Four Cheese Pizza! Yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. A classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
The penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and I must say I forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. It was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. We surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the Stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. Make sure to use your Zomato gold in good use here.
.
The cherry on top was Apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. We surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner.

The Glass Onion,Nikhil Sirivolu,19 April 2019,5,"What a beautiful place to go for dinner with family or friends! Headed to this place either friends for dinner and also for a special occasion.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.

A very serene beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy a beautiful evening!"
The Glass Onion,R Sai Kiran,19 April 2019,5,Been to this place newly opened last week with friends. It's simply wow had a great view of golf course. Service is simply amazing specially Ankit and Vishal. It's a best place to hangout with friends in financial district.. üòä

The portion is also less for the price but if you want a nice place to spend your evening with your loved ones, you can try this place. Just go and relax because the food will take time to come..
Would have given 3.5..."
The Glass Onion,Garima Nahata,17 April 2019,4,"So, this place is in Boulder hills and is spread across a huge area and the interiors is what one would love to go here for.

We had ordered pizza and vegetable Burger which was good In taste. The pizza could be improved a lot though.

We ordered noodles which was good in taste as well.

Overall, we had an amazing experience, cheers."
The Glass Onion,Shreya Matangi,17 April 2019,4,"I visited this place with my ex-roommate after 10 months.
Low crowd made us feel even more comfortable.
Attractive and romantic ambience..
Tasty food and very much reasonable...
Good service..
I had chicken breast steaks with mashed potatoes and salad üòã unexpectedly so good taste.
If you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
It tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
As we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
We wrapped up having sea salt Nutella dessert which was heaven of Nutella and different taste.
In recent times I've never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food.
I agree that prices are high but I forgot about the price when I had one spoon of food.

Do visit this place with your loved ones I bet you will have a perfect date."

Will come back again for breakfast, loved the view outside. Rice bowls are a must try. Broccoli Veg starter can be skipped."
The Glass Onion,Sawan Suman,15 April 2019,4,"Visited the place on a Saturday ! We had reservations made for 8pm and reached at around 8:20pm, only to receive a disapproving look by the lady and were told that it is difficult to hold a table this long! The entrance gave a deserted look and we were thinking why is this female so arrogant. Thereafter we got to know the real story as we moved towards the seating area. The place was well lit, with a posh ambience, perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment. Really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights.
We ordered Lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. The starters were delicious especially the chicken. Beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.
Ordered stir fried udon Noodles for main course. Although a bit oily, it was tasty, full of vegetables ! The dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering, the taste lingers.

The staff is courteous and the Vallet very kind and amazing person :)
All in all a good experience !"
The Glass Onion,Prithwish Basu,14 April 2019,5,Great food. Reasonably priced and situated in good location. Had lamb and pasta. Quality and quantity was great. We did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for the food. People coming for lunch would enjoy the Golf course view. A must try for foodies.
The Glass Onion,Rohit Goyal,14 April 2019,5,With the view of Golf Course and Selection between Wide variety of delicious dishes... This is one of the Best place to Hang Out... Perfect for a sunset view as well...
The Glass Onion,Ankita Dixit,14 April 2019,4,"Beautiful indoor and outdoor sitting, delicious food
We ordered Ravioli pasta (which was a show stopper)
Nachos, pizza and few of their mocktails.
Everything was just perfect , infact I have been to this place earlier and have to say they never disappoint. üëç A big thumbs up. Only down vote, for the place being a bit pricy. Would rate it as 4.5"
The Glass Onion,Sumeeth Varma,14 April 2019,4,"If you are searching for a place with great ambience, golf course view with a pleasent sit out area then this place is a perfect match. We had non veg platter, veg platter , classic chicken burger ( this tasted yum), pathari ghosh, bangok spicy rice bowl non veg ( interesting and a tasty treat) however there are fewer options for veg and menu can be improved.

Mocktails very not upto mark and definetly not worth the amount you pay for any of those options as were any other items so please note that its a pricey affair. Service was as usual nothing much to be praised about. Overall

Food & Drinks : 3/5
Ambience : 5/5
Service : 4/5"
The Glass Onion,Himika Saha,12 April 2019,4,"It's a must try place in Hyderabad. Located in boulder hills, this place is spacious and has a golf course in vicinity. The USP of the place is definitely the ambience. The large open area and also the pricey bar counter stacked with expensive liquor. Ideal place for a romantic candlelit dinner. The place reverberates the screech of birds at night and the experience is surreal. We ordered pizza and chicken wings and a couple of drinks. Food was average but the ambience is mind blowing"
The Glass Onion,Atreyee Ray,12 April 2019,5,"Amazing place. Spent a lovely evening here. the apple pie is really good, a must try. Korean waffles are nice too. Nice food, great ambience and great service. üòÑ"
The Glass Onion,Vipul Maheshwari,12 April 2019,5,"Awesome Place, Great View in love with the Place. Thin Crust Pizzas are great, curry combos are good but not sufficient even for 1 person. Great place to chill out."
The Glass Onion,Rohit Pareek,08 April 2019,1,"Tasty food, nice ambience, courteous staff. But zomato gold offers are not honored half of the times, depending on their mood. Service could be faster."
The Glass Onion,Vineet,06 April 2019,5,Super food and fantastic service by Vishal. He was extremely courteous and helpful. The ambience of the restaurant was out of the world . Very serene.
The Glass Onion,Aditya ReDdy,06 April 2019,1,"It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed."
The Glass Onion,Shivam Agarwal,04 April 2019,4,"When I entered the place I was impressed with the interiors and how huge the place was. What I really liked about the place was that it has a good veg menu as well. We had ordered for a Mac n Cheese Steak. I felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the Patty or The Pulao Rice, there should‚Äôve been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good. We had also ordered for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio. So the Spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn‚Äôt really like how it tasted. When we informed the management about the Spaghetti, they immediately changed it with Spinach Ravioli. The Ravioli tasted really nice, the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend.

Over all the experience was a really nice. Definitely a must visit."
The Glass Onion,Shashidhar Reddy,02 April 2019,4,"Ambience - 5/5 one of the best in Hyderabad, being next to golf course.

Food -3/5 can improve a lot on the taste. Ordered waffle fries, beer fish strips, double pepper lamb, four square pizza. Except for lamb none tasted great.

Service - 5/5 timely, courteous. No complaints.

U can get nice pictures :)"
The Glass Onion,Rhythma Raina,02 April 2019,4,"Let me start the review by complementing the owners for a catchy name ,'The Glass Onion'.
Great ambience, okay food and a mesmerising view and a perfect place to take someone out on a date.

Ambience 4.9/5
Food 3.5/5

Overall: 4.5/5

P.S: You will never regret visiting this place even if you don't like the food.;)"
The Glass Onion,Hungry Soul,02 April 2019,4,"Vegetarian Review ~

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

Overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. Ideal for romantic dates and celebrations. The whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all @theglassonion"
The Glass Onion,Rishita Mukherjee,01 April 2019,4,Great ambience. Very good service. Its a great place to go out with dates or family. As it is situated outside the place is quite peaceful too.
The Glass Onion,Aayushi Sinha,30 March 2019,5,Great place! Great staff! Great ambience! Best place for a nice Sunday brunch with friends and family. It's amazing for dinners too! Do try out the Indian cuisine!
The Glass Onion,Ritika Trivedi,30 March 2019,4,"Ambience 5/5 .. this place probably has one of the best ambience in town.
Service : exemplary 5/5 prompt courteous and polite
Relaxing and serene
Food is good
Kebab platter was nice . The cottage cheese could have better.
Liked the cottage cheese steak.
Nice blend of flavours.
Overall a nice place to visit to relax"
The Glass Onion,The Walking Glutton,30 March 2019,2,"Went for lunch along with my colleagues and ordered Salad, Lasagna, Chicken Pan Fried Noodles with Black Bean Sauce and Tiramisu.
Service was average standard, in terms of food the only thing I like was the Chicken Pan Fried Noodles as it had my favourite Black Bean Sauce."
The Glass Onion,Vishal Goel,30 March 2019,1,Place needs better staff. Food is good and lots of options. People who take orders are not the type for this level of formal restaurant. Food was above average. Won‚Äôt repeat it again
The Glass Onion,Srikanth Nagumalli,30 March 2019,4,"Had good food, good place to hang out with Friends, service was good. Fabulous view of Boulder Hills Golf Club. Calm place within the most busiest Hyderabad's Financial district"
The Glass Onion,Sriram Reddy,30 March 2019,5,Bit expensive for taste but worth for ambience and hospitality. One of the best venue for office parties and close to corporate offices around financial district.
The Glass Onion,Alfred Jerome Lazarus,29 March 2019,5,Anoop was really a great host. The ambience is lovely and the drinks are worth. Try the flaming Lamborghini and the lit without ice if you wanna get high.
The Glass Onion,Vishal,28 March 2019,5,MR.Sonai ur service and food was crazy along with your ambience.! Loved the TSC.!! The Ipl streaming makes it even a better place to chill out with friends and family
The Glass Onion,Surya G,28 March 2019,4,The ambience inside is cool and outside seating has nice view with golf court but only at nights. The menu has some good options. We liked double pepper lamb and non veg mezzeh platter. Staff was polite but bit lack of knowledge.
The Glass Onion,Rahul Reddy,28 March 2019,4,"The Glass Onion, hope it belongs to Global by what I've seen there. This place is built located exactly beside a Golf Course. The inside is just neat and calm. The food served is as good as their service. A calm alcoholic evening spent there is just astonishingly peaceful in the middle of the busy IT hub."
The Glass Onion,Manasa Redi,24 March 2019,3,"I have been to this for Saturday night dinner. The ambiance and the locality makes it a pleasant sit out with lush greens and golf court all around. The only thing which disappointed me is the service, which was very very slow and the response was not up to the mark."
The Glass Onion,Gopal Bhargav,24 March 2019,4,"Ambience is great, so is the food. Service is very fast. Serving people are very polite and are easily approachable. Food taste is great. Their location in Zomato is showing incorrect. It would be good if there are some directions put up on the road, it was not easy to find through the map. I would definitely visit again."
The Glass Onion,Ananth Popuri,24 March 2019,5,"Beautiful place to visit, perfect for a date to go with ur girlfriend. Staff is friendly and very patient when it come to explaining items in the menu. I have ordered waffles, pasta and noodles. Waffles and Pasta(white sause Alfredo) are delicious. One of the best pasta I have ever eaten till now. Noodles are okish. The wine collection is nice and they have all the whiskeys available and prices are also decent."
The Glass Onion,Renu Singh,21 March 2019,5,"Lovely ambience, good food, and very good service. Sanai waited on us and was very attentive and helpful.
Even on a warm summer evening the outdoor seating was a great experience as it was breezy and serene.
Loved the Bangkok spicy bowl. Chicken burger for the kids was strictly ok. Mezze platter was not bad."
The Glass Onion,Raashi Jain,21 March 2019,5,Glass onion is without doubt one of the places to eat at. Not only is the food amazing but the ambience is superb too. Friendly staff and good service . Check out the page s.t.a.s.h on Instagram for a detailed description .
The Glass Onion,Mishra1mayank,20 March 2019,1,"Extremely poor service and the staff denied the Gold benefits on the table. Overall not a recommended place at all, unless one wants to enjoy the location.

Summary - Location - 100%. Food - 75%. Service - 30%. Gold Membership- 0%"
The Glass Onion,Shubhangi Gautam,18 March 2019,2,"I had heard a lot about Glass Onion, but came back extremely disappointed. The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience. The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good. Overall, never coming here again and don't recommend to anyone"
The Glass Onion,Nikita Khare,17 March 2019,3,"This is place has good ambience and great variety of drinks considering cocktails and other acoholic drinks. But the food is a bit over priced and quantity is less.

The Glass Onion,Sayan Roy,17 March 2019,5,This place has an amazing ambience with very professional and premium service. Food is as well good and relishing. It's an amazing place to hangout with friends and family. Also can be considered for a dinner date. Very highly impressed.
The Glass Onion,Priya Vyas,16 March 2019,3,"We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday given the ratings we saw. However the restaurant did not live up to the high expectations, considering the average food and slow service. The staff was courteous though as we did not like our tomato soup, and they were prompt enough to take it back. Honestly, the replaced one wasn't much of a relief either. Would recommend there to go for the evening view with friends for few drinks, but don't expect mu h beyond that!"
The Glass Onion,Sai Krishna,16 March 2019,5,"This was a fantastic place to go the outer view of this place with golf course was marvelous, hospitality was good and every attendant informed about their food well
It was nice experience going there and especially their noodle bowls are awesome"
The Glass Onion,Apantham,15 March 2019,4,"This is relatively new place. Glass onion has a good ambiance and surroundings. Tried pasta , grilled chicken and couple of other starters.. service is very slow .. otherwise a good place and priced well"
The Glass Onion,Siju,15 March 2019,1,"Went here for lunch on a weekday with less crowd. Still pathetic service. Awful food. It took almost 20 min for the food to arrive. Another 20 min for even the bill to arrive.
Not recommended. Avoid it."
The Glass Onion,Jyothireddy.mj,14 March 2019,5,"Beautiful place. It is a best place to go. If your looking for a guite evening. An open golf course on view.
The food is amazing,Soothing music,Lovely ambience and highly recommend for continental and tandoori cuisine.
Service was slow for us.
But it is cool n clam place."
The Glass Onion,Prasun Gokhlani,12 March 2019,4,"Went here for the first time and the place didn't disappoint. Would love to see more seating places on the outside in the open. Great food and lovely ambience, a must visit !!"
The Glass Onion,Satya Kalluri,11 March 2019,5,"The ambience is nothing but awesome. Even on a summer evening, the breeze alone can make it a worthy visit.
The food is good, haven‚Äôt really experimented much - so wouldn‚Äôt comment. Loved the drinks, they have a good variety to offer than other ones.
The lighting, music, seating - fantastic."
The Glass Onion,Lasya M,10 March 2019,2,"We went as a group of 5 on a saturday night.
The ambiance and decor was good. Mosquito filled.

We had ordered
3mushroom soup : decent
Margarita pizza: we asked for a slight customization but sss not adhered to but given his own will on it
Quinnoa chat : surprisingly different and nice
Battered fish : decent
Kun pao chicken: succulent meat ... done well
Teriyaki mushroom: tasted more sour than like teriyaki
Borcolli kababs : melt in the mouth
Noodles were done well
Lamb in lemon butter sauce : i think a wrong dish of lamb was served
Cheese cake : done well..
Apple pie : okayish

All in all the food was decent but the service was pathetic.
We moved from outside to inside ac due to mosquitos and the rooms were also mosquito filled .. when asked he bluntly cited that there is nothing they could do.

The staff have no clue of the menu. Also food is not served in time, the lamb came 20 minutes after we finished rest of the maincourse.

Food : 3/5
Ambience: 3.5 / 5 it would have been a straight 5 if mosquitoes were dealt with
VFM : 3/5
Service : 0"

The Glass Onion,Neeraj Ramani,06 March 2019,5,"Well randomly searching for a restaurant in gachibowli area, we stumbled upon The Glass Onion.And what a lucky choice it was. Right from the entrance, the ambience vows you. The English decor, the taste and the service, everything was second to none. We tried a butter chicken platter and it was delicious. Especially the black dal was awesome."
The Glass Onion,Aditya Jain,05 March 2019,1,"Food and service everything is good. But not able to avail zomato gold at the end of dining. Vishal, Srikanth manager and vishawanath waiter everybody befooled that we can use zomato gold at the end but then it gets closed."
The Glass Onion,Shashank Karukonda,05 March 2019,1,"The service is shit, the waiter asked us not avail Zomato gold at the beginning of the order but to avail at the bill time. But gold was not available but to compensate no discount was given ... disappointing experience"
The Glass Onion,Shubham Jaiswal,03 March 2019,2,"Food was just ok. Visited this place after reading reviews and looking at the pics. First time when the dish came, it was burnt; we canceled and ordered again, but the taste was same like burnt. The only dish we liked was cheese broccoli. The mocktails were also ok.

The Glass Onion,Vijay Tiwari,03 March 2019,4,"Nothing ask more than this, nice place, good service, excellent food.

I ordered North Indian and other members ordered Italian food. Everything was tasty. One small suggestion to them that North Indian dish meal is little less for one people. Who eat only one roti in meal.

Location and ambience was very beautiful Empty bottle used nicely.

Service was good and quick.

Value for money, prices are little higher but I still say not bad.

Food : 5/5

Deli 9 Bistro,Saurabhdugar01,21 May 2019,4,One of the worthy places to visit. Loved the food#Deli9. Delicacies chocolate nougat pastry#Pasta#Indian cuisine. A bit overpriced with respect to quantity but not compromised with quality and hygiene.

Deli 9 Bistro,Bhargavi Vasudha Anantatmula,11 May 2019,5,Awesome place with great taste . You can taste desi along with continental foods. Nachos and pizza are must try. Sizzle rs were awesome. Desserts are tasty. Ambiance is great you might find prices a bit high but the taste worth‚Äôs it
Deli 9 Bistro,Abhinav Kulshrestha,06 May 2019,5,"This is the best place to have a casual outing with colleagues, during office hours.
Food tastes great! Menu is very well defined and have good amount of combos.
My favorite is punjabi puttar combo with lachcha parantha.. do try that of you go here."
Deli 9 Bistro,Kanak Mishra,27 April 2019,1,"Despite having a prior booking ... They made us sit in the last ,where the AC wasn't sufficient .
The management was too ignorant ... Said the same thing multiple times all to deaf ears .
There's nothing that was too good about it.
The food was below average and too pricy for the portion and taste they serve.
Won't recommend."
Deli 9 Bistro,Anuj Khandelwal,13 April 2019,1,"Why you have changed the menu guys. And the new menu is pathetic. I miss that old cottege cheese steak, enchiladas and lots of great items. Please revert it. I am rating 1 star for new menu, it's tasteless. Unecessary change. I was regular but now don't want to come after trying the new menu."
Deli 9 Bistro,Pallavi K,12 April 2019,4,"A cozy, comfortable and good place to enjoy a cup of coffee or have a complete meal. Ordered Thai green curry and it was really nice. Ordered coffee as well which was a perfect cuppa!! Certainly recommended!!!"

Deli 9 Bistro,Jesal Vora,17 March 2019,5,So i had been to this place like 3 months ago and we ordered chicken khou sey and chicken lasagna. I was just soo yum that my mouth still waters thinking about this place. I even loved the varieties of dishes in the menu. #happytummyishappyme ü§©ü§©
Deli 9 Bistro,Swati Singh,15 March 2019,2,Came here with my Family after 2-3 months and ordered usual chinese combo . They have changed their menu and made it more south Indian than continental like before . In chinese combo they gave us noodles topped with Paneer 65 ( with all curry patta and mustard seeds) This use to be my go to place until last year because of the freindly staff and variety in continental menu . They changed their menu and the new taste is not worth it.
Deli 9 Bistro,Abhay Hora,11 March 2019,4,The pasta alone is too good to fetch the high rating. The service is another reason for it. I would definitely like to have many more visits to try out other items in their menu card.
Deli 9 Bistro,Sahithi Anchuri,06 March 2019,5,"I have been there here thrice. The food is simply amazing but it's too costly.
Must try : crispy corn , cheesy french fries , deli 9 spl pizza and munchuria noodles lunch combo.
Mocktails : virgin motijo"
Deli 9 Bistro,Piyush Rangani,05 March 2019,3,The food is great over here.. we are sort of regular over here as its nearby to our office campus.. One can try the combos over here which have a great potion.. mocktails are good but expensive..
Deli 9 Bistro,Ashutosh Choudhari,03 March 2019,5,"Really a unique place with a subtle ambience, decent music and delicious food..!! I came here on a friday evening with my friend and we had burger and sandwich.
Price was quiet high but quantity was also more with a very good taste. To be honest, we were done for that day. Side dish was also nice.

Also this bistro is near to all offices, so
I must say it is a very nice place to dine in with your colleagues..!!!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Krishna Chaitanya Jayanthi,02 March 2019,4,"Liked the veg manchow soup very much, have been there for the soup few times . Even the other food items were pretty tasty and decent . There is a little wait time. A good place to hangout with friends ."

Deli 9 Bistro,Rohit Rao,19 February 2019,5,"Oh Deli9. I got memories here. Well, for a start the place is just one of the best. The ambience is something else. Love their service. üíì their choices of food they have. It's a complete mix but it's just very good.

The cafe has an impressive interior decor and comfy seating area.The cafe has outer seating too which is very spacious and beautifully done up. The cafe serves amazing snacks and drinks which can be enjoyed at a very pocket friendly prices.
No meal can end without sweets, thus to satisfy the sweet tooth, the cafe has a variety of bakery items.
Thus this cafe should be on the must visit eating joint of hyderabad."

Chicken Steak with mash potatoes, chicken pizzas and fried rice are must try. Never forget to order something to drink, they are simply the best combos available out there.
Parking could be tricky to obtain and make a call before you leave to this place."
Deli 9 Bistro,Satwinder Singh,10 February 2019,2,"Nice ambience, wonderful service but not so wonderful food.
Ordered the Thai green curry, was just a watery mess, probably the worst ever had.
Kung Pao chicken was overly sweet, the noodles were just tossed around in a few eggs and probably 2 pieces of chicken.
The rice was very dry giving us an overall average experience."
Deli 9 Bistro,Suraj Shenoy,09 February 2019,3,Had ordered veg lasagna and enchilada for home delivery. The lasagna was good but after taste wad not that great. Enchilada was more like an Indian preparation. Could be better.

Menu is perfect to cater to any cuisine, a bakery for your sweet tooth. An all at one stop place. Try the citrus iced green tea if you prefer unconventional teas."

- Quick Service

Food Recommendations:
- Chicken Loaded Burger"
Deli 9 Bistro,Akshay_Globetrotter,27 January 2019,5,Must Try Beef Grilled tender loin steak and veg stroganoff it's just simply awesome . One should come here for food in low budget but awesome quality .
Deli 9 Bistro,Ajoy Thomas,26 January 2019,4,"This is one of the best dining place situated near Wipro circle . Since it's near by to our waverock site it's easily accessible .good place to hangout . Decent staff , good food .chicken steak is the one you must try .would have been in this for more than 10-15 time trying out different food .

So every time we go we use Zomato Zomato code which one of the best option here .but last time when I went they have removed it since the contract is over .

Wish you @deli9 team should consider Zomato again which will allow to enjoy more food and suggest other . Totally a good experience .

Deli 9 Bistro,Jameel Ali,17 January 2019,4,"Nice and cozy place to hang out.professional service,dishes were pretty awesome too.loved the fish n chips,veg lasagna was quite delicious, must try more dishes, definitely a place u can visit more often!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Ashish Minj,17 January 2019,2,"Had a very disappointing experience. The place didn't do justice to it's rating. I don't know what happened, maybe the chef had a bad day or maybe that's how the food generally is. Ordered fries with cheese which was poorly seasoned, the fish in fish and chips was literally dripping in oil. There didn't seem any effort put into the Potato wedges that come on the side of the burger. The service was good.. if only food was half as decent!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Anjali Sharma,17 January 2019,3,"Among all the dishes I have tried there, Cottage steak was the one which stood well for me. They serve this with cottage tikki, barbecue sauce (which was going really well in combo).
Veg burger was just fine, not really worth trying."
Deli 9 Bistro,Ani Rocks,13 January 2019,4,"Liked the ambience and the presentation of the food. More of a formal place . Tried fish fry, chicken lasagna, rice bowl mongolian chicken, garden veg pizza. The taste was good."
Deli 9 Bistro,Kalpit Shah,13 January 2019,5,"We were not that hungry, so we ordered veggie 9 burger and veg shawarma wrap and they were good. Service was pretty quick and ambience was nice."
Deli 9 Bistro,Nikhita,12 January 2019,4,"I had been to this place after long time last night for dinner. I must say the ambience is still so marvelous. Each wall has something interesting by itself. A great place for photography. Coming to the food. We ordered:
1. Bull frog
2. Fanta
3. Pepper chicken bao
4. Ginger chicken bao
5. Fish and chips
6. Cajun chicken breast sizzler

The bao's are a must try. Both of them were yummy. Fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish wasn't that great. Coming to the sizzler...i felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt. A little bland for my taste. Other than that everything was good."
Deli 9 Bistro,Maheen,11 January 2019,4,"A very cool place to hang around. I am a fan of their food and beverages. They will not disappoint you with any of their dishes. I think their Mocktails and coffee menu should grow now. Having the same standard stuff will become monotonous for regular customers because they are not very great! However, their soups and desserts are to die for.. Overall, I always had a good experience at this place. Staff is friendly and patient, but not good at suggesting you what to order. :D"
Deli 9 Bistro,Swastik Uprety,06 January 2019,4,"The ambience of the place was great and the food was really amazing...We had delicious Alfredo Pasta and Chicken Sizzler, though felt the price was a bit on the higher side, it was worth the taste and experience...Thumps up Deli 9 Bistro üëç"
Deli 9 Bistro,Jaya,06 January 2019,3,"Food is good and ambiance too, just that we ordered for Pasta for my kid with no spice and it was loaded with black pepper which was not a pleasant experience. Staff is a bit rude may be because they are not well staff."
Deli 9 Bistro,Utkarsh Ranjan,05 January 2019,4,"Amazing nachos and a really good tenderloin burger.
The ambience is really nice and cozy. Service is quick and polite.
Veg menu is limited and a few more starter will be great."
Deli 9 Bistro,Avishek Bera,05 January 2019,4,"I generally get my food delivered from this place. Kung Pao chicken rice bowl is my favourite from this place. It is served with veg fried rice. Not so spicy, you can have it daily if you like :) ...I have also tasted fish n chips from this place. The menu is bit pricy but tasted good!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Barnopriyo Barua,05 January 2019,4,"I recently visited here for lunch with my office team mates . The food was really good, and the staff were polite and quick to respond. The ambience was pretty pleasing too.

One issue with this place is that the parking area is really really cramped. It is small, and since it is shared with the other eateries in the same building, parking your car can be a bit of a headache here."
Deli 9 Bistro,Dheeraj Santosh,03 January 2019,4,"One good place to hangout in financial district ...Ambience is good and food is tasty , Tried pasta and chilli peppers rice bowl ...additionally zomato gold works"
Deli 9 Bistro,Anusha Sinha,28 December 2018,4,"Ordered:
Veg pasta
Lasagne
Butter chicken Biryani
Colsaw salad

The food is really good. I specially recommend the Biryani. The flavours are good. Ambience and service.. really good. Must visit."
Deli 9 Bistro,Priyanka Aggarwal,26 December 2018,4,"This place is very nearby to my house, and I order from here a lot of times. Mostly I have tried pasta here, almost all varieties, and all of it was good. Thai curry dish was also above average. Cute place to hangout. :)"
Deli 9 Bistro,Samrudh Kelkar,26 December 2018,5,"This place is Gold if you want a good dining experience in financial district. Amid all the star hotels and big names, this place has made its mark. It is not cheap but thats fine, considering the portions they serve and taste. You will be done with one burger or a rice/roti with a curry. Zomato Gold comes to your rescue if you have one. I like simple chicken burger and lemonade. Burger come with some potato wedges, salad."
Deli 9 Bistro,Jyotika Singh,24 December 2018,4,"Deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that's why I flock the place pretty frequently. My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz. It's a poor version of our limca. The mojitos here are pretty refreshing though."
Deli 9 Bistro,Dattaraj Naik,22 December 2018,5,"Tried the chicken stuffed steak and the fish steak which were genuinely impressive. Not only were the waiters friendly, they had fast service as well. With the Zomato Gold membership I could avail the 1 + 1 offer which destroyed my hunger pangs!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Deepak Ahuja,21 December 2018,3,"When you hunt for nice place.. and meet folks who are just busy in their own.. it‚Äôs a let down..

Staff really needs to pickup on the service and behavior..
not at all a nice experience
Food saved this place the 3 star.. coz it was tasting decent..( not great again..).

Not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)"
Deli 9 Bistro,Madhup,19 December 2018,5,This is a good place to dine. The food is really good. Although there's not so much that you can order. The ambience is really nice. Just giving 5 star because me and my friends just love the aloo 65 pulav.
Deli 9 Bistro,Moonis Ahmed,19 December 2018,4,"Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. 

Besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.

Highly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli. 

Ambiance - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 5/5
Value for money - 3/5"
Deli 9 Bistro,Ashita Agarwal,18 December 2018,4,"A place with good food, cute ambience and a small place filled with memories and good times. They have got it all in their menu from pasta to burger to various kinds of bowls. They have got amazing coffee and cakes.
Nachos was not that good so we returned that dish and their pizzas are finger licking."
Deli 9 Bistro,Sofia Ahmed,15 December 2018,3,Have visited deli 9 many times with good experiences but this particular time didn‚Äôt have the same. I ordered Singaporean prawns for starters. As I was using Zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which I haven‚Äôt heard anywhere before. After some question the waiter agreed. The quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good. Then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee. Overall the service disappointed me but its a good shot for some good food
Deli 9 Bistro,Akhil Tadikamalla,13 December 2018,2,The food was not good as expected. The service could have been better. Please concentrate on taste . This place is not for lunch better try for dinner
Deli 9 Bistro,Revanth Khambampati,08 December 2018,5,"Decent place to hangout and spend time , good food with a average ambience.

Decent place to hangout and spend time , good food with a average ambience."
Deli 9 Bistro,Sujeeth Mike,08 December 2018,5,"Rice bowls and dessert is a must try. The chocolate served hot was delicious.
Good ambience, price, speed of service and a special call out to their cutleries.
Menu is less complicated hence you won't get into paradox of choice.

They welcome Zomato gold and don't tamper the food quality when we use the the gold membership; unlike the other restaurants."
Deli 9 Bistro,Rohit Sharma,07 December 2018,5,Excellent place with very good ambiance. Great food and especially love the fact their portions are meant for one person so everyone can order what they want. Punjab putter and thai curry are a must have.
Deli 9 Bistro,Ajay Yadav,06 December 2018,1,Worst restaurant. They mentioned on Zomato gold but denied during order. They mentioned we earlier on Zomato gold we now not accept it.i felt cheated on Zomato gold if restaurant will deny such a way
Deli 9 Bistro,Astonishedflame7,04 December 2018,4,"A great place with good food and ambience, the sizzlers are not that great but the hot dogs and pizza are quite good .
Ambience : 5/5
Food : 4/5"
Deli 9 Bistro,Aakansha Mintri,03 December 2018,3,"Okay, so I really get agitated if the coffee that I order doesn't meet my credentials .

I don't think they understand the ingredients of the type of coffee that you order.coz I had asked for a strong cappuccino and what was offered was more on the terms of a milky latte.

The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.

All in all, this place isn't that great when you compare with other cafes in the town."
Deli 9 Bistro,Bipindharmic Veerlapati,02 December 2018,5,Amazing burgers and Pizzas. Ambience was good. We‚Äôve tasted a chicken burger and tex mex lamb burger. Both are very tasteful. Pizza was good too
Deli 9 Bistro,Sneha Bhat,01 December 2018,2,"Had a very disappointing experience here today. We had been eyeing this place since long and planned our brunch to be had here. Loved the place, it was spacious and the ambiance was really good. The first thing I ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages. Next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable. Did not felt like ordering anything after this. Highly disappointed."
Deli 9 Bistro,Manisha Yadav,30 November 2018,4,"Its like a second home. I have had dinner and lunch here like 25 times. Very comfortable place to be at.
The food is good . My favourite is paneer bhurji, dal makhni and tandoori roti. Love their pav bhaji. Have tried almost all of their menu."
Deli 9 Bistro,Anish Patwardhan,30 November 2018,4,"Been here too many times and as always this place never disappoints me.

So last time I went here and we ordered Chicken lasagna and Singaporean prawns, also cold coffee (not in picture)
Kheema pav is my all time favourite dish over here. Do give it a try. I will recommend you to book table because sometimes this place is too busy.

Staff is polite and well trained, service is prompt, and ambience is great."
Deli 9 Bistro,Umesh,26 November 2018,2,Food tastes good however had bad experience with freshness of food being served. Happened once at eating out at restaurant and second time while ordered home delivery.
Deli 9 Bistro,Dev,25 November 2018,5,We ordered Cape Ground Chicken Lasagne along with Garlic and Chilli spiced Chicken Pizza. Both the dishes were awesome. The minced chicken in the lasagne was perfectly cooked. The Pizza had a thin crust and good flavors. To top it off they have Zomato Gold offer as well!
Deli 9 Bistro,Yogesh,24 November 2018,2,"Deli 9 staff didn‚Äôt have the basic courtesy to inform that for 4 diners, it would be appropriate to unlock 2 Golds. They gave only 1 dish feee whereas we had ordered total of 7 across 4 diners."
Deli 9 Bistro,Shayma Khan,23 November 2018,3,"Once my favourite deli9 cheesy enchiladas are now a nightmare.

Deli 9 Bistro,Tejeswini Naidu,22 November 2018,5,Small but a Lively place . Very good service . I love the nachos here which are served with cream of mayo etc.... the main course dishes combinations are good and evethng here to worth trying .
Deli 9 Bistro,Surabhi Gupta,20 November 2018,4,This place has decent ambience.m and good variety of food. They also have a great variety in dessert. Food is good and the best part is the location which is close to the tech space.
Deli 9 Bistro,Vikas,20 November 2018,4,I had lunch many times here. Nice place with good food. Never had issues with services. They have many varieties of food starting from sizzling to paneer roti .
Deli 9 Bistro,Parinit Agarwal,18 November 2018,4,"The branch of Deli 9 in the popular Nankramguda building which houses a few more eateries definitely stands out. The place has a nice young ambiance and seems premium and inviting.
The service is pretty quick and staff is also very accommodating and knowledgeable
About Zomato gold.
The food is the best part about the place. Inspite of offering multiple cuisines ranging from thai to Italian to continental to indian and lebanese.. they seem to get the balance perfectly right."
Deli 9 Bistro,Amardeep Dabass,18 November 2018,2,"I had a nice dinner planned with my wife here. I have had lunch many times at this place, but that evening was special. We got a cockroach along with the meal. When complained the only thing they offered was to replace the dish."
Deli 9 Bistro,Fancardio88,18 November 2018,5,Burger was delicious so was the lemonade drink...first time used zomato gold...the ambience was also good...would love to come back again..moreover it‚Äôs near my working placeüòä..
Deli 9 Bistro,Aditya Kumar,18 November 2018,4,"I visited this place on a weekday in the evening to have a snack.
- Ambience was good. Service was prompt and responsive.
- I ordered Pineapple lemonade, cheesy fries and chicken burger.
Liked the cheesy fries (with mustard sauce)and burger.
Overall good place to hangout and have a snack. Will visit this place again. :)"
Deli 9 Bistro,Payal Khullar,18 November 2018,5,"This place never disappoints me. Never. Totally love the nachos chaat in the starters- prepared warm, crispy with right dose of sour and sweet flavours. Paav bhaji is also very good. In main course, their paneer bhurji combo is my all time favourite. Also must try is Lasagna at this place. Byw, I love how they give you good quantity of food as well. The staff is super courteous."
Deli 9 Bistro,Amit.kanodiya,16 November 2018,4,"Good place to have quick food to satisfy your taste buds. Been there couple of times with some friends, every time the food is good and service is prompt."
Deli 9 Bistro,Advait Shiralkar,12 November 2018,4,"the ambiance of the restaurant is very spacious and good. The service is very fast before you know you order is on your table. Must be very careful about the  quantity of the dishes. we went for Green peas veg soup. it was delicious  and heart-filling. in the main course, we went for punjab puttar (veg) it was delicious and sufficient for 3 people. we went for a fish main it was a very very spicy and a huge disappointment. Our overall experience was good, but not great."
Deli 9 Bistro,Vivek Chandramohan,09 November 2018,4,Have been to this place many times and have tried different dishes. Never had a bad experience. They do not have many dessert options though which is a little disappointing.
Deli 9 Bistro,Rob Forza,03 November 2018,1,"Lol. I paid 345 bucks for what tasted like ready made pasta without any salt in it, along with a tiny, flaky piece of bread (that had neither butter nor garlic) wrapped in aluminium foil. I've seen more effort from places that charge 200 bucks for a dish. It was BAD. I counted three pieces of capsicum, total. Most half-assed pasta I've had in years. Super disappointed."
Deli 9 Bistro,Sangeeth Reddy,01 November 2018,5,This is one of the best cafes around in the area with a wide variety of options on the menu. Singaporean chilli prawn and keema pav here are the always opt of in doubt! The ambience is also pretty cool and the service is impressive. A must visit place for hanging out.
Deli 9 Bistro,Seshadri Reddy,01 November 2018,4,"Overall a 4.5 experience.

This place has an nice warm ambience. As their tower burger isn't available we have ordered Chicken Burger along with Lamb Pizza and Lasagne. The burger was amazing the patty was so juicy and was perfect. The pizza was also good. The lasagne was a tad bit disappointing as it was felt grainy in the mouth but tasted delicious. The service was very prompt. Would love to visit this place again."
Deli 9 Bistro,Rishabh Wahi,01 November 2018,3,"More is not always merrier, hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich, although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice.

Home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland.

Penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked.

Best part was the desert, old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate.

Overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting"
Deli 9 Bistro,Namit Agarwal,01 November 2018,3,"Deli 9 Bistro is in front of Holiday inn express and suites hence becomes a perfect fit to order some dinner.

I have ordered one Veggie 9 burger and tried Shawarma wrap and Deli 9 Bistro garden veg pizza in the restaurant it self.

Veggie 9 burger - 3.5/5
Deli 9 Bistro garden Pizza -4.5/5
Shawarma wrap - 3/5

Pizza was very good .It was a thin crust pizza with cheese,sauces and veggies on top of it.
Burger had a Patty with cheese and some Vegetables like cucumber,tomatoes and onions.I found the burger pretty average.

With both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.When I ordered then as well as when I went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.I can understand if it was only in the case when I ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.That was seriously not expected from Deli 9 Bistro!!!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Mrinali Shobhit,27 October 2018,4,"Deli 9 bistro is one of the good find in this area for us.
We have been looking for a place like this near our office from quite a long and usually had to compromise with some ok places for lunch, but if you are also working around this place then deli 9 bistro is a place which will serve you variety of food options with satisfied palate.

The ambiance of this place is pretty nice, a place to have a conversation with your meal.

The staff is polite and friendly and very professional.
Their menu has food almost everything mood of yours, the portion size is decent and taste is also pretty good.

Kashmiri kebab platter and thai curry rice is good to have.
Looking forward to try more dishes and update the review."
Deli 9 Bistro,Prashant Banerjee,25 October 2018,3,"disappointed really disappointed. After eating at the original banjara hills outlet, this is a sheer letdown. Loved the banjara hills outlet"
Deli 9 Bistro,Tarun Attri,21 October 2018,1,Allmost all items we ordered were tasteless. Plus service was average with guy taking orders appeared rude. He was behaving like he is owner and does not care if we come back again or not.
Deli 9 Bistro,Utkarsha Goswami,14 October 2018,5,"Great ambience, great food. Ordered Thai curry with rice, paneer butter masala with paratha and veg manchurian bowl. Easily accessible place with a friendly staff. Definitely a must try!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Shreyansh Agarwal,13 October 2018,3,"Visited this place after office and I was not very impressed by the offering of food. Although the food served was differently presented than usual, I did not like it much.
Did not find it a place to repeat. Although, my friends did like it and I would recommend a visit just to chill with a group of friends."
Deli 9 Bistro,Ahmedconstruction2017,11 October 2018,4,"The best part about this place was the ambiance, music was cool with very friendly staff. Was there with a friend and ordered a lamb burger which was small in size, and not worth the amount but at the same time it was really tasty!"
Deli 9 Bistro,Food Nawabs,10 October 2018,4,"It's all about Food, a small and a ambience filled with memories and good times. Deli9bistro has been revamping it's menu across most of their outlets. From burgers to rice bowls and Noodle bowls too, they've got it all. But once in a while we like to sit back over the amazing Orange Frioska that they whip up and the Mangalore Fried Chicken. Deli9 bistro has some amazing cakes, Burgers and a whole lot of varities to choose from the Menu. A Must Visit place although there is a confusion of choice I clearly declare this as a winner for me. 4/5 is my liking"
Deli 9 Bistro,Ria Sur,09 October 2018,4,Really love the food. Itiqliand english food are awesome. I would really suggest people who are taking a break from traditional courses to reallt try out this place.
Frio Bistro,Oindrila Dutta,17 May 2019,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in the locality. Great food. Good interiors and good service. I love their set of menu. The quality, portion size and the taste of food never disappoints. Some of my favorites are stuffed chicken breast, curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli and Hyderabad hot pizza."
Frio Bistro,Rohit Rao,17 May 2019,5,"Frio! Like unique name like unique place. Frio is one Awesome place. Whats really nice is now a days you see these black interiors that's really catching the trend and not they have done it real good.

Food is amazing, they have baked pizzas that's really tasty and cool, their cooler drinks are tasty, snackers lip smacking.

We were 6 of us and this person there, Sachin, was really nice and on spot. Served us right, made sure our food experience was smooth, kept asking us feedback of the food. It's a lovely place. Must go.

Thank-you Frio! :)"

Frio Bistro,Sarvani Upadrasta,10 May 2019,5,"Best food I have ever had..Satisfied with every dish and there are so yummy. We tried club chilly cheese toast,mezze platter,florenten garden,spicy tomato arabiatta,signature mushroom risoto and
frio's signature tiramasu..Every thing is great and unique....It is not the place for spicy lovers....U should visit this place to taste unique and delicious food...Love the ambience too"
Frio Bistro,Akanksha Jain,09 May 2019,4,"Ambience- 4
Food- 4.5
Service- 3
Value for money- 4.5

Came here for a quick lunch.
Ordered mezze platter, wild mushroom fricassee and peach iced tea.
Hummus tasted good but the pita bread was a little hard.
The pasta was heavenly. Perfectly cooked pasta and lots of mushroom with an amazing sauce.
Iced tea tasted nice but was a little too sweet. Make sure you mention it to them if you‚Äôre not a fan of super sweet drinks.

Could improve on the service bit, the staff is a little slow and less responsive even when it isn‚Äôt crowded.

5/5 in terms of value if you‚Äôre a gold member.


Surely trying this place again."
Frio Bistro,Varun K,05 May 2019,5,"Wonderful restaurant! Absolutely fabulous food!

Ambience: very nice and comfy... Doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.

Food: every morsel is heavenly! They nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... Loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne Alfredo is pretty good too... As is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... Absolutely delicious! Mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... Couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...

P.S. - they do have a bar but no Bira.

Service - polite. But you must be patient. Food preparation takes time. If you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.

VFM - it's an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it. He's absolutely spot on with the flavours. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. You deserve it!"
Frio Bistro,Jayanthi Palanichamy,05 May 2019,5,This is my favorite comfort food place. Almost all the items in their menu are super tasty. Their keema puff is one of best I have tasted. Pizza and pasta are delicious too.
Frio Bistro,Harshet Agarwal,04 May 2019,3,"good location and menu
at first it seemed like an ordinary place, but had a good feel to it
according to food the prices are quite high, not like the ingredients are imported.
food was decent and so were the drinks
over an average experience"
Frio Bistro,Sreetama Pal,04 May 2019,4,"Really really nice addition to the Gachibowli food scene, this place is comfortably furnished and rather perfect for a long catch up over delectable food.

Pineapple espresso, burgers and the pork ribs are highly recommended. Pizzas looked interesting as well.

Good value for money. Good service, although our server seemed slightly clueless initially.

Definitely worth a couple of visits :)"
Frio Bistro,Arun,30 April 2019,3,Food is okay..but the behaviour of staff is unwelcoming.. really need to learn how to speak to your guests..when guests ask anything you need to answer patiently
Frio Bistro,Leena Gupta,30 April 2019,2,"This is one of the poor Italian restaurants in Hyderabad. The first giveaway was the menu cards. They were all torn and faded. Few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.
The chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.

Coming to the food, I can say that it was very disappointing. We had ordered -
‚Ä¢Chicken Wings
‚Ä¢Tangy Arrabita Pasta
‚Ä¢Farmer's Ortalano
‚Ä¢Tiramisu

‚ñ™Ô∏éThe chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt. Also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - Sweet and heavy.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe red sauce of the pasta was diluted .It was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. It was thin and it retained its shape.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe tiramisu was a disaster. The cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. We had to send it back.

Finally, the service. The service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.

All in all, I will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone."
Frio Bistro,Priyambada Choudhury,27 April 2019,5,I had first been here on my bday last year. This place serves some Kickass fried chicken starters. The service is prompt and lovely. Adding the Zomato gold on top of it just makes the experience even better. Deriving recommend it.
Frio Bistro,Saket Bhukania,22 April 2019,3,"I liked the interiors of the place. They are milimistic and simple with a decent ambience. Would rate 3/5
Coming to food, I had ordered bruschetta and Pasta and it was not the best, but just Ok. The cheese balls were good though. (3/5)
Would rate the staff - 2.5/5"
Frio Bistro,Rama,21 April 2019,4,"Food was great... We ordered Andhra chicken pizza which had a variant touch of Andhra flavours, Prawn n fish risotto and Fiery chicken meal. All the three dishes were tasty and filling. We availed zomato gold offer but as we did not inform them before placing the order, initially they were very reluctant to accept as we need to inform them well in advance before placing the order. The restaurant manager was very understanding and generated a second bill, though he will be questioned by the owner he took that extra mile just for providinding customer satisfaction. I will definitely suggest this restaurant not only in terms of food but also in terms of their polite and customer oriented generosity. Thank you frio for making our visit splendid."
Frio Bistro,Gokul,20 April 2019,5,"I absolutely love their thin crust pizzas and would definitely go there again and again.. The desserts were just good enough and it made the experience complete..
Service can do with a minor improvement.."
Frio Bistro,Ashritha Rao,15 April 2019,1,"I wish I could make you taste the Chicken Nuggets. No offense for the people who liked it. But, i never had such worst food in my entire life. The dip they gave with French fries was one of a kind.i personally would not suggest this place to anyone."
Frio Bistro,Rajorshi Roy,14 April 2019,5,"Was there for the desserts. I ordered a Tiramisu...it's one of the best I have eaten. Loved it. Only downside, place closes down relatively early for a dessert joint."
Frio Bistro,Asmita Pal,14 April 2019,4,Food and ambience was great. But the service was a little bit on the lower side as the person was a bit rude with us. Overall we loved this place ‚ù§Ô∏è and it made my bday awesome..
Frio Bistro,Sandeep Jangala,07 April 2019,4,"A really nice place with some great food

Location and Ambiece -4/5
Its placed right near the hitex city and gachibowli signal junction and very easy to access
The ambiece is good and decent to visit with your family and friends.

Food -4.5/5
The place has great food and everything is very fresh. The hand made pizzas are great and very thin. The fish for the fish fingers is fresh and not frozen. The desserts are great as well.

Service -4/5
The staff is very good and explain the menu well. Food is served fast as well"
Frio Bistro,Pruthvi Raj,02 April 2019,4,"After hearing so much about pork ribs, ordered blazed pork ribs and belly dance Pizza on my visit .
The ambience was good , but disappointed with the service. There was long delay for serving the food, no proper attention to the customer requirements was the key disappointment factor.

Coming to main topic the food Pizza was great but it was a mixed feel for pork ribs as I always like my meat to be spicy but the barbequed sauce was little sweet not to my liking.

so with my limited knowledge of consistency of meat the overall all food served was good.

But it's not a place for people like me who is more into spiciness.

With Zomato gold the overall bill was 860."
Frio Bistro,Rishav Sarkar,30 March 2019,5,"Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Ambiance 5/5
Visited this place for dinner yesterday night. I would say first visit was very nice. Pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied . We ordered Mezze platter and Frio Signature Chicken Wings for starters. Mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity. Chicken wings were also very delicious . The Barbecue one was my favourite. For the mains we ordered Barbecue Pork Ribs and Greek Chicken Souvlaki. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. Really liked the flavour of the Chicken Souvlaki.
Staff is courteous and friendly. Good experience all together."
Frio Bistro,Saugata Chatterjee,29 March 2019,4,"Very good quality food - I tasted the Baby Back Ribs here and they were delicious. One of my other friends had ordered pizza - though the presentation was above standard, the taste wasn't.
The ambience of the place can be improved because it's just slightly dull and cramped up at the moment, though they can do a lot with the place. Food-wise, a must visit."
Frio Bistro,Niveditha Barigela,27 March 2019,1,My pizza looks like they have pieced together the left overs! The cheese is hard and the slices look old. I'm so disappointed as I order quite frequently from Frio and this is the second time I am getting a pizza in this condition from them.
Frio Bistro,Sheeny Yadav,23 March 2019,3,"Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.
The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.
Service was fine. We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.
Here is what we ordered:
100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.
Dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.
Chicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.
Lamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.
We couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.
All in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either. Happy dining!"
Frio Bistro,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,4,"Expensive, but good food especially Italian and Finger Food. Decent service, though could have been better. Good location and seating with decent view."
Frio Bistro,Asisha Ayachitula,13 March 2019,3,"I'm reviewing a delivery order.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this."
Frio Bistro,Srayana Sanyal,12 March 2019,5,"Frio is one of my favourite places to go to in Gachibowli since it opened, and by now, I‚Äôve pretty much tried most of their dishes. Their staff is cordial and efficient, the black toned decor is very avant-garde, the quality of their food hasn‚Äôt deteriorated in the last 2 years.
The must try dishes on the menu are ‚Äì
1. Glazed pork ribs (sinful and heavenly!)
2. Chermoula grilled fish
3. House chicken salad
4. Turkish lamb pizza
5. Mushrooms fricasse pasta"
Frio Bistro,Kruttika Lokesh,10 March 2019,4,"The food is the best I've had in Hyderabad, by far. The music doesn't match the general ambience for me. But the concept of the restaurant is quite good. Service is great. The mocktail I had was average at best. Mushroom khari and the paella are must trys."
Frio Bistro,Naveen Kumar,02 March 2019,3,"I was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday.
Ambience was decent. It was a tad too dark for my liking, but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting.
Service was pretty decent. The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving.
The food was a big disappointment though. Of all the dishes we ordered, few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace. Main course (Spinach ravioli, Belly dance pizza, Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi) was a total disaster. Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch. We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake, which was good and filling.

Overall, an average restaurant. If you‚Äôre looking for good Italian, this is not the place to be. CIBO house is."
Frio Bistro,Mahathi Natva,01 March 2019,4,The coffee at this place was one of the I ever had ... A small cozy place with good food is something everyone needs to tackle a hectic week or take a break from the everyday stress... The broccoli with cheese and aglio Olio are a must have . If you are a coffee lover it's a must try.
Frio Bistro,Suvarnala M,26 February 2019,5,"Had an excellent evening at Frio. Well done coffee with stuffed chicken breast. The place is very cozy and always full of nice, friendly people."
Frio Bistro,Sindhu Ram,24 February 2019,5,"Food is too delicious. ambience is quite good and coming to the food service , staff - Manoj & everyone was good. Mushroom starter was yummy."
Frio Bistro,Soumi Mukherjee,16 February 2019,5,"This place is my go to place for continental food at Gachibowli. The food is absolutely awesome. My recommendations would be Doner kebab, any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs.

The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.

In pizza, I love the pigs over a blanket pizza. The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.

In mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.

In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...

The service is quick and the staff is courteous."
Frio Bistro,Nikita,13 February 2019,2,"Went on a weekend afternoon with some friends and the place was completely empty!
The service was good but the food was not. The pasta was completely bland and the pizza too stretchy! When we told them to add some spices they just reheated the same and brought it back.
The ambience was okay, but not worth going just for that!
Not a good experience at all!"
Frio Bistro,Spandana Bhoomolla,10 February 2019,5,I really enjoyed lunch at this place. Our server Mr Sachin was really nice . He helped us order and his recommendations were just on top.The pizza is the best. A must have here. Try the ravioli too if you like pasta. The place has a laid-back friendly vibe.
Frio Bistro,Ritesh Singh,08 February 2019,4,Always loved this place for quick food but tasty one. Staff is very friendly and with smile on face (specially Manoj). Must try is mushroom on khari.
Frio Bistro,Geeta37,06 February 2019,4,"4.5/5 Just WoW. Ambience is pretty cool . Loved the food. We ordered frio signature chicken wings and Bruschetta for starters. Pork ribs and pan seared fish for Main course and of course Tiramisu for dessert. Haven‚Äôt expected to have an yummy , delicious Tiramisu. Your palate thanks you for having such a delicious food. Definitely would recommend however I felt bruschetta taste was overpowered by olives which are not supposed to be in :)"
Frio Bistro,Shrikanth Reddy Aenugu,01 February 2019,5,"Visited the restaurant for a brunch with team.....

The service is not as expected.... I would give a 2 star for it.

Coming to the food .... the taste is good.

Fish was ok and chicken was ok.... pizza is tasty"
Frio Bistro,Abhinav,31 January 2019,3,"Food quality: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Whenever a menu of a restaurant is limited, we generally expect the taste to be phenomenon. Most of the things that we ordered were okay but the pasta had very thin sauce and also the pasta was not properly cooked."
Frio Bistro,Tripti Maheshwari,24 January 2019,3,"Being rated well on zomato, I had expected it to be impressive, but the ambiance was just mediocre, food was again average.. didn't find anything special about it. Also, there are not really much options on the menu."
Frio Bistro,Yum Yum YUMMY !,23 January 2019,2,"Overall Experience : 2.5/5

Service : 3/5

Food Quality : I'm not able to decide.

 Taste : It was horrible for me

Value For Money : 3/5

I dont know why but I really didn't liked this place much. Usually I avoid bad ratings but for the first time I really left my fav. chicken wings on table. They were too bad in taste. Will attach the images soon (y)"
Frio Bistro,Meenu Garg,22 January 2019,1,"We ordered food for home delivery with one line instruction ; garlic bread to be prepared without spices, which was not fulfilled. This was ok, what wasn't was delivery of chicken. We ordered vegetarian cheese balls and we received chicken! Can we ever trust you again, Frio Bistro!"
Frio Bistro,Samrudh Kelkar,21 January 2019,3,"They serve very small portions.. not at all worth the price. Service is good. Tried pizza, pasta, fiery chicken signature dish. None of that was above average. Taste and prices could have been better. Zomato gold can be redeemed here.

Giving extra star just for the service staff. They were helpful and prompt."
Frio Bistro,Karishma Bhatt,20 January 2019,2,"I had very high expectations from This one. But disappointed. Talking about food , the taste was below average. We ordered Pasta and pizzas both were not at all good. The only thing which i liked about this place is the Ambience. It's very decent. Coming to service, the waiters were very humble but our order took more than 1 hour to reach us to the table. Overall Below average experience . üòê"
Frio Bistro,Ramya Nambu,16 January 2019,4,5 stars for the Ambience--the place is super cosy and makes you feel at ease. I didn't feel like leaving! I'm a vegetarian so the veg food was pretty good. The garlic bread was otherworldly! üëåüèΩ Overall the place is a little pricey but still worth it.
Frio Bistro,Joycee Hanna,15 January 2019,3,"It was a funny experience there. While the main course is quite satisfying, the deserts were a total let down. The ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation, the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away."
Frio Bistro,Suvam Mohanty,13 January 2019,5,"Awesome place ! Food is great and so is the service ..
Nice view .. worth going and spending time.. surprises under Gold privileges , but nevertheless an pleasant place to spend time with friends & family ."
Frio Bistro,Anurag Paul,09 January 2019,4,"It was a late Sunday evening and we decided to go to Frio after pulling each others hair for an hour. Had to call in as the restaurant was about to close in 10 minutes. They were gracious enough to take our order and also served us well. The food was good, it was almost there both the pasta and the risotto. We had the curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli. Chicken was a used scarcely maybe that was a put down for me because I am a meat lover. The pasta though was perfect, spicy just like I want and the penne was well cooked. Thanks for taking us in Frio on a cold Sunday night. We will be back."
Frio Bistro,Tejaswini Sharma,07 January 2019,5,"Well if atall I am in Gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner times...my mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro. Each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation.
Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
Every time I go to this place...I come out happy tummy n happy soul .."
Frio Bistro,Kowsik,06 January 2019,4,Good place to visit and the ambiance was awesome. Best place to hangout with friends. Food was yummy the starters were good. The overall experience was awesome.
Frio Bistro,Jay Mehta,06 January 2019,4,"1 star less for the bad look the server gave when we mentioned about gold! Rest are for amazing food .

tiramisu and chocolate dessert best in the area"
Frio Bistro,Monali Mohanty,31 December 2018,3,"Been to this place last month. Quite a peaceful place not many people were there. We ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta. I somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly. But there were literally no toppings except chicken. Pasta was clearly not upto the mark. I had given specific instructions which weren't taken care at all. Also, later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership. We did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have Zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management, because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did. But didn't quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning.. Do they charge differently for the gold membership people because they have offers??"
Frio Bistro,Ritvi,31 December 2018,4,"Food was okay overall but the mocktail wasn't much. Tried chef's special fish but was not upto mark by a single iota. The ambience was definitely a big plus though, with a nice view of the cityscape. The service experience was also pleasant."
Frio Bistro,Kalyan Ch,30 December 2018,1,"This place was on my list for a long time.
Decided to check it out and was badly disappointed.

The mild mushroom soup was too bland and they don't serve a 1/2 of the soup. You will have to order 2 soups instead.

The Red Rooster pizza just didn't have any taste to it.
Gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster.

Stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place.

The regular water they served had dust floating on it, had to get bottled water.

Would never go to this place again. Won't recommend to anyone either.

The prices are on the higher side and they are just not worth it."
Frio Bistro,Priyanka Das,30 December 2018,1,Very unprofessional staffs!! Don‚Äôt even know how to serve the food on request!! Whatever you will ask their 1st answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. They also do have communication issues. Very disappointing!!
Frio Bistro,Sambhavana Kumar,29 December 2018,4,"We went to Frio Bistro on a lazy Sunday evening. It‚Äôs easy to find and a cozy place right on the main road. The portions are all made for one person only but are very filling. We had the Alfredo pasta and it was hands down one of the best pastas I‚Äôve had in the city. The starters are good and filling. The mocktails are fun tasty drinks.
What we had: tomato and olive bruschetta (highly recommended), Chilli Cheese Rolls, Spinach and Corn cheese ravioli, Artichoke and baby corn a la plancha, cranberry kiss (highly recommended) and Mojito.
Ambience- 4/5
Food- 4.5/5
Cost efficiency- 4/5 (could have been higher, but Zomato Gold is a saviour)"
Frio Bistro,Priyanka Aggarwal,26 December 2018,4,"Good food, nice ambience and quick service. We ordered, veg pasta, which was very good, pizza, above average taste, and cheese rolls - super cheesy and crispy. We like the food. The cold coffee was also quite good there. :)"
Frio Bistro,Being Prateik,22 December 2018,2,"The place had an amazing smell of bathroom pee when we entered. Hillariously the manager seemed barely aware of this horrible stench and promised to spray.

The lamb pizza which I suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it's meant to be eaten with spaghetti. The mezze platter is enough for one person barely. It's literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers.

The desserts is where this place shines. They apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake..? That fondant cake should taste still of maida because they didn't understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit OR apologize.

Don't go its bad."
Frio Bistro,Yash,12 December 2018,4,This is a great place to have good food with an okaish ambience. Me and my friends went there for lunch. I ordered stuffed chicken breast from the chef's special coloum. The dish was great and also looked very nutritious. I would recommend this place. Give it a try you may like it :)
Frio Bistro,Vishal Khandelwal,09 December 2018,5,We have been to this restaurant twice in last month.. the and taste of food is really nice and I like it a lot.. I like mushrooms khari the most and overall service was nice and good experience.
Frio Bistro,Heemaal Kaul,09 December 2018,5,"Really good food, friendly staff. The pork ribs are a must try. The food was well cooked, very well presented and the menu had a lot of interesting dishes."
Frio Bistro,Arindam,07 December 2018,2,Somedays it's decent but somedays it's so not good. Yesterday we ordered fish paella and the rice was tasteless just dipped in chilli water. I love spicy food but not like this. We also ordered lamb bolognese and for both dishes it looks like they recycled the same generic masala mixture. It was so pungent.
Frio Bistro,Abhishek Patel,07 December 2018,5,The place is not too huge or classy but it is good enough to have a nice peaceful meal. Went for dinner and ordered a pizza and Arabiata pasta(both veg). Pizza was thin crust and it was one of the best crust I had in a while. If you like the original taste of tomato then this pasta is for you as it retained that taste.
Frio Bistro,Sajeev N Sherine Medikonda,02 December 2018,4,"Interesting menu, backed up by execution. A variety of continental cuisines tried, one of the first places I have seen try a Spanish paella in Hyderabad. Good value too"
Frio Bistro,Nom.Nom.Foodie (Ruthwikkumar Durgam),30 November 2018,4,I was here with my pals for a lunch. We have tried a pizza and ravioli here which was so good. The whole review will be updated soon. The place has a good ambience
Frio Bistro,Ridham,30 November 2018,3,"I would rate it 3-4 star. It is a mediocre restaurant with different cuisine.
Food was ok. First was minestrone soup, it did not have any exotic vegetables or pasta. Tangy taste was good. Mezze platter was average.humus was good while pita bread was not upto the mark. Thin crust pizza Farmers Orelanto was good. Had nice crust. among deserts, ordered for chocolate fondant, it was the best with right amount of sweetness.
Presentation of each and every dish was superb. Staff is polite. Good place for quiet dinner. Can improve on food taste though."
Frio Bistro,Sneha Gupta,24 November 2018,5,Awsome as always! Keep it up!
Frio Bistro,Vikas Jagetiya,17 November 2018,5,"Veg guy review. Good Restaurant. Soup taste was nice. Pizza crust was with good, thin and crispy and very good olive, spinich flavour. Rosetto test is good.
Moctain taste ok. Can improve on their choice, options and taste
Service staff good attention
Interior of restaurant fine
Zomato gold applied so got good discount
Veg start can have more choices"
Frio Bistro,Jeevak Gupta,11 November 2018,2,Good food but not very friendly customer service. The servers were way unfriendly. Overall average experience. Would request management to improve the quality of staff serving the food. Their attitude needs to improve.
Frio Bistro,Sidharth Thallancherry,06 November 2018,3,"The place has a nice quiet ambience, I was surprised that it wasn't crowded as you'd expect a top place to be on a weekend.

We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place, the place had a nice charm to it . We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs, but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order. We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly, when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10:15pm.

Coming to food, the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that's probably my palate , the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender. Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too.

The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm. Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don't actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food, it just doesn't leave a good experience, Possibly the restaurant and it's employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way.

The rating is for the food and the place in general.Service is a bare minimum."
Frio Bistro,Kapil Thakkar,05 November 2018,3,"Average food. I had cheese garlic bread, pizza and white sauce pasta. Cheese garlic bread was good, but pizza had lof oil in it and pasta had no sauce. It was a bit dry. Didn't like it much. Staff and ambiance were good."
Frio Bistro,HappyHunger,01 November 2018,3,"Frio Bistro is located in Gacchibowli, below the Tilt. I went here with a couple of friends. I had ordered Belly dance pizza and ravioli. The pizza was damn good. Nice crisp crust and the toppings were perfect. But coming to the Ravioli, I was very disappointed. It had way too much pepper in it. And the taste of the sauce wasn‚Äôt satisfactory either.

Service: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Pizza: 5/5
Ravioli: 3/5
Overall: 3.5/5"
Frio Bistro,Anjali Sharma,01 November 2018,3,"A sophisticated and calm place to eat. I'm a big fan of their Stuffed cheese steak (chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach, served with mashed potatoes and veggies). The sangria was not up to the mark and the chocolate shake was also average. I would definitely go there for their pastas and the stuffed steak."
Frio Bistro,Aviral Singh,31 October 2018,3,We ordered Spinach and cheese cream ravioli and spicy tomoto pastas. Spinach and cheese cream ravioli was delicious but i expected it to be white sause pasta and it was red sauce pasta. Pit Master oizza was good. Cheese lovers was not so good it was thin crust and taste was awful.overall it was overpriced and taste was not very great but ok ok
Frio Bistro,Shubhangi Gautam,29 October 2018,3,"I really had high expectations for Frio Bistro. It'd been on my To-Eat list for a while. The food is average. We had a pasta, the Chicken & Sausage paella, and a cheesecake. Nothing was really sooo yummy/out of the world. And it was really costly. But the staff was courteous. However, I probably won't come here again"
Frio Bistro,Bhargav Nilagiri,28 October 2018,4,Great pizza. decent rissoto. But no wifi as mentioned. Had difficulty using gold as there is no network. would recommend this place to a friend
Frio Bistro,Ankita Mohanty,28 October 2018,4,"Hummus Hummus Hummus ...
Went crazy for the hummus ... already been there twice ...
Nice variety of international cuisine and deserts .
Looked the decor ... should go there in the evening !


Must try‚Äôs : Mezze platter ....
Prawn and Fish Paella...
Chicken chilli nuggets"
Frio Bistro,Saurabh Jain,27 October 2018,1,"Just be careful ordering here, they mix up vegetarian and non vegetarian food. It's a good chance that you get served a non vegetarian dish instead of veg version of the same. Staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). Overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. Nothing great or distinctive. This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time."
Frio Bistro,Mallika Rahut,27 October 2018,5,"The food and drinks are amazing here.The beer cocktail is very good.
The service is also very good.The ambience is vertical soothing.
They also serve coffee which is awesome."
Frio Bistro,Kunal Haldankar,27 October 2018,2,"The ambience is excellent , the food not so much , we ordered a half n half pizza , margarita & bbq chicken , the pizza was not up to the mark , now for the second dish we had ordered was Alfredo Chicken Pasta , the pasta sauce was very liquidish , chicken was undercooked. I am have visited this restaurant before & it was an awesome experience , we used Zomato good during this visit of ours , not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste , there were 2 pizza slices left & the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders / rules from zomato , they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but not give it to the customer , this is very strange rules , zomato relook at your guidelines"
Frio Bistro,Hyderabad Food Bowl,24 October 2018,4,"Frio bistro is a fine-dining restaurant with classy interiors which was painted full of black color which brings the elagance to the place. The bar set-up was small,quirky & the inverted glasses tied up with the ceiling made it look beautiful. This place offers italian,Indian & Continental as well.
.
I visited this place yesterday for a quick lunch & ordered two main course dishes. The first dish was belly dance pizza which is a 12"" thin crust pizza topped with Arabian shawarma peices,capsicum which had that earthy flavor in it . The chicken pieces were juicy & tender. The whole pizza tasted delicious with it's toppings. The other dish we ordered was spinach & cream cheese ravioli. Pasta was hand -made by the chef added with Italian styled tomato salsa & fresh parmesan cheese . Ravioli was stuffed with spinach which wasn't up to the mark. After having pasta, I felt like I should have ordered the white -sauce variant.
.
And,service was a bit late. If you are in a hurry, the service might create a problem for you."
Frio Bistro,Pankaj Parikh,18 October 2018,4,"If you are looking for an authentic Italian pizza, this is the place to be. Loved the food, esp the pizzas and the pasta. Service is good while ambiance is totally worth a visit."
Frio Bistro,Alok Kaul,14 October 2018,4,Great service especially the barman; He took care of the kids and their needs. Small gestures go a long way. I would strongly recommend this restaurant. Thank you Frio
Frio Bistro,Bhargavi Neti,11 October 2018,5,"A nice place for a date, went there on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fast. We had 1. Ceasar salad - which was good 2. Spinach and Cream cheese ravioli - which was okay."
Frio Bistro,Bhavin Gala,10 October 2018,4,"Was here with my colleagues. The service was excellent. Vegetarian food was good. My colleagues liked the non-veg dishes a lot. Ambience is decent.
Would visit them again to try more options in veg."
Frio Bistro,Sridhar,08 October 2018,4,"So, we decided to have some grub on a Monday afternoon and dashed off to Frio Bistro for no particular reason. There were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was OK. We carefully curated our order - Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, Lamb Ravioli and Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. I must say the food tasted authentic and delicious.

Chimichuri Pan Fried Fish, the chef's special, came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust, salsa, sauteed spinach and scallion rice. It was easily the best dish we ordered. The Lamb Ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. Then came the spicy Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. It generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.

All in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.

Frio Bistro,Radhika Burra,02 October 2018,3,"Have been for lunch. Honestly speaking had a good expectations, but not really did the food satisfy my taste buds.

Soup ""Rustic Itallian Minestrone"" was a good start to begin with. Assuming something different it will be ordered ""Gacchibowli Fried Chicken"", only to realise it was another version of KFC Friend Chicken. This was little disappointing. And in main course ""Stuffed Chicken Breast"" was descent and not so out of the world taste but it's ok.

All in all descent ambience, ok food but service has to be improved a lot. For me for sure not a second time visit place, rest you can do try for sure you may be lucky and fortunate to get better taste of food."
Frio Bistro,Arjun Sharma,24 September 2018,5,"Awesome food keep rocking guys ,had lunch yesterday and their cheese cake both were awesome.i will visiting this place more frequently.will suggest to my friends also"
Frio Bistro,Hari,23 September 2018,4,It is a good place. Food was good. They can increase quantity little bit. Service was fast enough. Ambience is good. Overall we liked the place.
Frio Bistro,Sudhir,21 September 2018,2,"after looking at all these good rdviews i thought the food would be great..but it was not..dominos pasta is far better than this,i orderd salsa pasta cost 415 rs..not upto the mark..then ordered few more veg items nd they were not good ..it does not justify the prices at all..i ate better pastas at my office restaurents at half the price..not happy with food quality. though ambience nd service was good...may b in veg they dont hve better quality food.."
Frio Bistro,Monideepa Chakraborty,19 September 2018,4,"Frio Bistro is a little quaint place tucked away somewhere in the crowded area of Gachibowli.
The decor was very pretty and the place looked very cosy.
We had non-veg pizza and chicken wings for starters. Both were equally good. The highlight of our meal was pork ribs which was served with veggies and mashed potato. The pork was soft and succulent and melted instantly in our mouth. One could easily say that was prime moment of our dine at Frio Bistro.
Desserts were good as well, but could have been better.
Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place to visit if you want to have a comfortable meal in the midst of the hustle bustle of this city.
Would definitely go back to this joint for their amazing Pork ribs!"
Frio Bistro,Kshiti Dubey,13 September 2018,3,"Food was good. Service was great. The staff is super courteous. But the food didn't really make me go wow this is amazing. It was good, but then again, not out of this world. It's a great place to hang out. We had the bacon pizza, Alfredo pasta, and the prawn and fish paella. On a visit before that we had the mushroom risotto. The mushroom risotto was great! The bacon pizza can have a bit more of the pizza sauce on it. I didn't like the taste of the raw red pepper in the paella. Finished with hot chocolate which was amazing. Looking forward to trying a few other dishes there on the next visit."
Frio Bistro,Snehakumari,11 September 2018,4,Really good taste..tried twice ..both the time had a good experience.. good ambience.. vallet available.. courteous staff.. can be a go to place on repeat without doubt
Frio Bistro,Syed Ghouse Mohiuddin,10 September 2018,3,"I wish I could give it a 3.5 but don't have the option. Just for the record it deserves a strong 3 (closer to a 4).

We tried the Pizza, Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach, spaghetti followed by deserts.

The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us (we did not expect that). The others were also very good and I would go again for sure.

The Tiramisu, although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down. The Bakhlava was just okay, not a bad attempt. The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm...

Overall, I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side. We ended up paying about a 1200 per head ..."
Frio Bistro,Sreenadha Bezawada,10 September 2018,3,"Had a family lunch while on a visit to Hyderabad. Suggested by my son settled for the meal.

We went with the suggestion of the Steward, for starters had Mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. He was okay.

Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. A bigger disappointment."
Frio Bistro,Balasubramanyam Karamala,09 September 2018,5,Very Awesome place for people who loves the Continentals with European . I totally very very impressive of Frio's Team hospitality . My favorite here is English Chese Balls and chese cake.
Frio Bistro,SHADAAB ANWAR,07 September 2018,2,Unhappy. Mezze platter had no taste and they took over 45 mins to prepare the food in spite of showing an expected delivery time of 30 mins. Not satisfied with service or taste. Thumbs down for me. üëé
Frio Bistro,Kavish Jain,05 September 2018,4,"One of fav place to eat the Italian food.Whenever feel like having good Italian food I come over this place and try different dishes . I love their garlic breads , pasta , thin crust pizza , some rice items etc etc. if you love Italian food and cheesy food this is the must try place here.

Frio Bistro,Anu,04 September 2018,2,Not as good as it used to be.Used to like pasta a lot but turned out to be a big downer this time with degraded quality. They definitely lost a repeat customer.
Karachi Bakery,Anupam Acharya,17 May 2019,5,"Well you know what they are famous for - Karachi Biscuits. But there is a whole range of stuff to eat at their outlet.

Karachi Bakery,Rajalaxmi Panduga,27 January 2019,2,I love Karachi for its taste. No issues with the food. But I ordered a pastry and asked it to be given as parcel. They just threw the pastry in the box and no spoon was given. However the pastry was awesome!!
Karachi Bakery,Sourav Roy,06 January 2019,5,Loved this bakery for its amazing variety of biscuits cookies n variety of pastry plus there tit bits. U would have to be there to understand what this place is all'about. USP of the chain is its reasonable pricing.

Karachi Bakery,Anusha Sinha,28 December 2018,3,The snack items are nice. The pasta here is good. I have also tried the cupcakes which were also good just a bit too sweet. The ambience is very good and there is sofa seating available too.

Will I go again? Definitely! Been there many times already and will continue to go."
Karachi Bakery,The Walking Glutton,04 December 2018,1,"I visited on 27th Nov morning around 11am to pick up a cake. The outlet was medium crowded. As I pick up my cake and go ahead for billing, I see only one out of three billing counters is operating. Although I was the second one in the cue but the family whose billing was under process had more than 4 basket filled with items which approx would have more than 40 items. In not less than 5 mins the cue extended till 5 people waiting for the billing. When asked to the manager, to operate other billing counters he replied ""WE DON'T HAVE MANPOWER"". Frustrated with the cue, we asked how can you just have manpower for one billing counter where you have machinery available for 3 he replied, ""WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO HIRE""!
What an experience!"

I found this outlet nearby where I was staying and walked down there post lunch to buy some stuffs back home to Chennai. It has got a nice ambiance and when you enter, all you see is boxes and boxes in different shapes & sizes ready to be taken. 

I took in a couple of boxes. The Premium Assorted biscuits box which consisted of Fruit biscuits, Osmania salted ones, Pistachio and some Cashew biscuits and also another Fruit Biscuits box for the office."

Karachi Cafe,Shivangi Singh,21 May 2019,3,I have tried Irani Chai and Pasta Sandwich in Karchi cafe and the taste and not that great. I feel this cafe is really hyped and the taste didn't go According to my expectations
Karachi Cafe,Vignesh Rk,11 May 2019,4,"This place has a really aesthetic ambiance starting from the vintage design to the 60-70s music that plays in the background.
We ordered the famous Irani chai with a bunch of onion samosa, fries and a pasta sandwich.

This place serves one of the best Irani Chai that i have had in hyderabad. The onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so. They tasted amazing here. I wouldn't recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all. Kills the taste completely. These needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint.

Talking about the fries, i wouldn't say they were amazing but they sure weren't bad. We did not like the Pasta sandwich. This item wouldn't be something that i would recommend.

This place would remain one of my favorite spots to hangout at.

(Could be a little cleaner though)"
Karachi Cafe,Akash Pingley,03 May 2019,2,"One of the worst services I would have ever come across. There were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed.
The first time, I ordered an Irani Chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed. It was served in a broken glass. Very disappointed.

The second time, my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling.


It‚Äôs sad to see such disappointment from a brand like Karachi."
Karachi Cafe,Andleeb Zaidi,29 April 2019,4,"Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you‚Äôre at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!
Food:
‚Ä¢Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and saut√©ed vegetables.
The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
‚Ä¢Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.
‚Ä¢Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it‚Äôs literally addictive!

Beverages:
‚Ä¢Cold coffee- The beverage wasn‚Äôt cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.
‚Ä¢Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn‚Äôt very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.

Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. Perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family."
Karachi Cafe,Isha Chakraborty,27 April 2019,5,"Staffs are Very polite, friendly and understand customer's problem like I was unable to eat continental in the plate that they have served but they noticed and served extra plate before I ask them for.
Ambiance of cafe is very nice, full of old stuff, photographs and plants as well.
U can also put the plant on your table.
Food is good and quantity is more than enough.

This place became one of my fav. Very frequently I started visiting this place.
I think you people should give a try, will be in love with the plants , stuff, food, ambiance."

Food:
Food tastes classic karachi types and the prices are high.
Had a Bombay Roasted sandwich and Dum Ki chai.
Bombay Roasted sandwich
Price:INR 150
TASTE:4.5/5
Dum ki chai
Price: INR 55
Taste:4.5/5
The sandwich gave me a classic Bombay vadapav taste and was baked and roasted well.
The dum ki chai was to the next level of Irani Chai and ultimately said to be well
Ambience:
Ambience is a classic karachi ambience where all the walls are filled with posters of 19th centuary movies and the classic advertisements of beverages.

Overall rating :4/5
Price:3/5
Taste:4.5/5

Karachi Cafe,Priyanka Lenka,21 April 2019,2,The food was okay. The ambience was good but the waiter's behavior was not good. A zomato guy came to receive an order he asked for a glass of water and they denied him and told him to wait outside.
Karachi Cafe,Shalini Mukherjee,17 April 2019,4,"Been to this place a few months back. I must say, it has a very aesthetically pleasing decor. Both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement is available. It is also pretty easy to locate.

The items we ordered were Barbeque Mushroom Sandwich, Spaghetti in Alfredo sauce with Vegetables, Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice cream, Irani Chai and Filter Kapi. Apart from the apple pie, all the items were really tasty. The pie's crust was a bit too thick. Rest, everything was worth every single penny. I would love to visit this place again.

Quantity: 4.5/5

Value for money: 4.5/5

I also happened to order their Exotic Vegetable Pizza through Zomato. I found the price quite reasonable. The best part was the sauce with a desi twist.

Karachi Caf√©, with a variety of food and beverage items and an amazing ambience, is a really cool place to hangout."
Karachi Cafe,The Food O‚ÄôClock,01 April 2019,1,Very bad service. I had to askfor a glass of water 5 times. One waiter passes the message to another and the other one doesn‚Äôt care!!!! Horrible service. I m never going back there.
Karachi Cafe,Shalu Singh,31 March 2019,4,"This place has a eye catching ambience. A small cafe that is best for a quick meeting, short break etc. I tried the pasta that was a bit spicy but good in taste."
Karachi Cafe,Subhendu Khan,17 March 2019,4,"It's a very mind soothing place, you may find out childhood stuffs. A aroma of 80's are all around. A great place to hang out for friends and couples. Food prices are not beyond limit."
Karachi Cafe,Ankita Mahajan,03 March 2019,5,"Looking for a cute place for a date and chai, then it is among my top 5. Loved their pasta and the jam roll was wow. Can't wait to go there again."
Karachi Cafe,Shubham Billus,02 March 2019,1,"Man! Who the hell are giving such high ratings to such useless cafes? Yesterday I went to one cafe seeing a 4+ zomato rating, and it was horrible. Today I went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure pathetic-ness of the cafe. The service is so rude, slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service. The food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices. And the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered isn't available; let alone bring drinks along with the food. I don't know how these inflated ratings in Hyderabad is working, but in my hometown, a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato."
Karachi Cafe,Anjanaa Karthik,01 March 2019,5,"I really wish i could finish off the review in a word, but yeah, zomato is not letting me to that! If you guys want to have irani chai, i guess this is the place. And omg, that onion samosa? Before getting there, do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go ga-ga for? Yes. They have it! You don't need to go street to street searching for them. They have it right here. So one plate samosa, irani chai and osmania biscuits. You hit cloud nine! Oh i forgot, this is for you guys! To the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa, you'd definitely wanna hit this place listening to 'mere sapno ke rani kab..'. yea. Only Kishore Kumar ! And the place. Let's just say, it's all VINTAGE!
Ambience, food chai, music, cleanliness- 5/5 ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Karachi Cafe,Alisha,28 February 2019,5,"Nice place to hangout with friends and also I must say thar its an hidden gem at Gachibowli. It takes back to the different world.
Very creative ambience
Polite staff
Great chai
Stylish and vintage decor."
Karachi Cafe,Akhil Mahajan,28 February 2019,4,"Recently visited this place.
Food-4/5
Ambience-4.5/5
Service -4/5
This place has amazing interior and a cafe without good interior is not worth to go to. It has rustic feel.
The food is really good. Amazing north indian, mughlai food they serve here. Service was okayish"
Karachi Cafe,Rachana Srivastav,27 February 2019,5,"This restaurant deserves a special mention for their superbly amazing Keema Pav!! I usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (I prefer home-made), but the Keema Pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! We had even ordered for Baida Roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (By the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) Suleimaani Chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.
The ambience is also so good! They had these old ad posters put up on their walls - it really reminded me of those old Parsi restaurants in Mumbai."
Karachi Cafe,Palak Kashyap,24 February 2019,5,"Love the ambience, has a rustic feel to it. I recommend the chai and their baked goods. The service is good and everything is reasonably priced."
Karachi Cafe,Devesh,18 February 2019,4,"The ambience literally brings you the vintage feels. The service of this place is brilliant.
When I visited this place firstly I had ordered for some bun maska and Sulaimani chai, really liked it. I also had the chicken kabiraji, personally I felt it could have been slightly better."
Karachi Cafe,Soumi Mukherjee,16 February 2019,4,This place serves some authentic mughlai dishes with a modern twist to it. Do try the mughlai paratha here which is stuffed with chicken with a sip of irani chai.
Karachi Cafe,Akshay,11 February 2019,4,This place brings you vintage feels. The ambiance is adorable with all the wall frames and vintage decor. Tried Alfredo pasta with fried chicken toppings which tasted good. Service was fine.
Karachi Cafe,Tanya Gupta,10 February 2019,5,"Vibrant colors and delicious food. This place has all you want to lift up your spirits. The combination of raw and retro ambience will leave you mesmerized. Immerse yourself in their zesty food variety because they have a lot to offer.
Don't forget to try their potato fingers."
Karachi Cafe,Sarthak Gakhar,08 February 2019,5,"Visited this place to have Irani chai during my visit to Hyderabad. It's a small cafe with nice and cozy interiors.

Irani chai was made to perfection. I got a strong, sweet and milky tea in one chai glass.

Service was great!"
Karachi Cafe,Aamir Nawaz,04 February 2019,5,"Dishes Tried: Keema Pav, Baida Roti

The food is pretty good. I mean I have tasted better keema pav but this also good, notbhrrst but good. Baida roti was pretty interesting taste.

The staff was very welcoming. Ambience is pretty great."
Karachi Cafe,Varun Barla,02 February 2019,4,"Went to the place not expecting much. The menu threw me off as most of it seemed overpriced. We ordered Irani chai and mawa cup cake to begin with. Both of these were really good! We followed that up with barbecue mushroom and club chicken sandwich. The sandwich was filling and very delicious. We topped it off with another round of Irani chai. The place has an old worldly feel about it with old posters, transistor, old TV etc yo take you to the good old times. Also, old Bollywood songs add to the charm. Great place to have a cup of tea and snacks!"
Karachi Cafe,Anupam Agarwal,31 January 2019,4,"Looking for a nice evening Chai and something to go with it , this can be one really good option. Located in Gachibowli just off the main raod it's a nice small cafe.

The interiors give you a feeling of a hangout place for the millennials , to just come, sit, relax , have tea and just engage in hearty conversation. If you have a office in Financial District one can take out probably an hour and can visit the place.

I would definitely recommend some of the items
Tea - I am a tea lover and hence can never get over this
Keema Pav - good
Irani onion samosa - definitely recommend
Bun Maska - dip it in tea and enjoy

Overall a nice place can be visited at leasure

Overall 4
Food 4.5
Ambiance 4
Value for money 4"
Karachi Cafe,Prateek Chhipa,31 January 2019,4,"Had veg puff here a number of times but this karachi cafe never disappointed.
Everything is fresh and tasty but the only downside is that the sandwiches and burgers are just reheated and served.
A few of the menu items are available only from afternoon and get over pretty quickly so I usually call them up to check before I visit this place."
Karachi Cafe,Hardik Seth,29 January 2019,4,"A vintage themed cafe by the legendry Karachi Bakery with a soothing ambience, having some posters, advertisement, old movie scenes hanging up framed on the wall. Liked the old time Television, Telephone, Sound Tape which are also an add on to the decor. The food variety they offer is something that can be related to quick bites. Had Dum ki chai and it was soo refreshing one. Could be compared with "" Kadak chai"".
A visit may uplift your mood ! :)
Overall good experience."
Karachi Cafe,Hearty_connoiseur,27 January 2019,4,"This retro themed cafe was cozy where u can get lost reading ur fav book at the corner table indulging in retro music..!! U can‚Äôt help but shake a leg
The famous Irani chai With thr richness of milk is all u need for a gloomy day
Stylish chicken sandwich is a must try with perfectly grilled chicken
Don‚Äôt try the items marked as must try (they are actually the ones that doesn‚Äôt taste good ü§£)
On a sweet note u must try their Victoria cake slice & blueberry cheese cake"
Karachi Cafe,Duggu,16 January 2019,2,"I had a really bad experience in Karachi cafe. I have visited this place with a lot of hope as the rating and the review are really good. Ordered only ginger tea, Irani tea, osmania biscuits but unfortunately we did not like anything they offered.

Even the tea was not good and the pricing is really high and I am not ok with paying rs. 75 for a bad cup of tea.

Sorry folks. You guys need to improve."
Karachi Cafe,Priyanka,10 January 2019,2,"The retro theme ambience was classic.
But I didnt like the food over there, it was average. I even ordered ferrero rocher shake and would rate it 2/5."
Karachi Cafe,Sourav Roy,06 January 2019,5,Cozy place that offers good variety of food. We loved the burgers n pastas. Would love to try the kabiraji in my next visit to Hyderabad. It is bit overpriced but quality wise it's very decent. Must try one u r in Gachibowli
Karachi Cafe,Guru Prasad Das,01 January 2019,4,"This was the first place I visited after reaching Hyderabad... Located off the main road in Gachibowli, this place serves delectable food... The ambience gives a feeling of retro space with the decor mostly consisting of retro themed wall hangings...

We tried the keema pav, paneer Tikka sub and macaroni sandwich... The service was on the slower side... The food took around 30mins to reach our table... Keema pav was simply awesome... The keema was nicely done... It was quite flavorful... The macaroni sandwich and till sub was also good but have had better in the past... We were also served for fruit biscuits which was again simply delicious...

Overall a good place to have some snacks and chat..."
Karachi Cafe,Vinita More,01 January 2019,4,"What a variety of biscuits, cookies, cakes etc. It was a delight to find gluten free and sugar free options too. We ordered for hazelnut coffee, muffin, tomato cheese sandwich, veg puff etc. Everything was delicious. Enjoyed."
Karachi Cafe,Pragya V,18 December 2018,4,"I tried their ginger tea, some cookies and apple pie. And I loved all of them. The price is definitely high for tea but so is the quantity. The picture is showing one by two of one ginger tea. üòÖ"
Karachi Cafe,Moonis Ahmed,03 December 2018,4,"The visit to this place was something on my mind for a long time. This was rated highly on Zomato and was recommended by a number of my contacts, so decided to give it a shot on a Friday night with the 'homeminister'. 
We came in late but the place was still lively. On entering, you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro. With the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background, you definitely feel like going back in some time. 

We settled in and ordered fries, keema pav, and chicken farcha. To gulp it all down we ordered the Irani chai. 

Boy o boy we were in for a treat. All the dishes were simply delicious and mouthwatering. Their keema pav is true to its name and fame, amazing. The chicken farcha was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. All the dishes were served piping hot which enhanced the taste.

Service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot. Though the place is small, it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well. Slightly on the pricier side, we still felt it was worth it given the quantity. With the trusted name of Karachi sweets as the backers, you can definitely count on the quality. 

Ambiance - 4/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Value for Money - 4/5"
Karachi Cafe,Paramita Sarkar,30 November 2018,4.5,I was introduced to this brand in airport. Then came across their biscuits in Spencers. So when in hyderabad how could i miss visiting karachi bakery. This outlet was near my temporary residing place.. I like their cookies a lot but i have fallen in love with their chocolates.. The sugar free ones are also yumm.
Karachi Cafe,Salimuddin Ansari,15 November 2018,1,"I have ordered red velvet cake once. They asked to change the order as red velvet was not available. So, I asked the available list of cake and on that list I ordered chocolate cheesecake. After 50 min of waiting they again call me and told that cheesecake is not available. What kind of behavior is this. Never order from here"
Karachi Cafe,GoSouGo,13 November 2018,4,"This place is lost in the row of cafes and restaurants in Gachibowli. Cute little cafe with vintage Indian vibes, having posters of old Hindi movies and early Air India adorning their wall. Can be a good spot for a casual date or a catch up. We ordered an Irani chai and nankatai. Both of them were yum!"
Karachi Cafe,Anirban Saha,06 November 2018,5,One of the best cafes in Hyderabad to spend time in. Do try Irani Chai if you're here. The staff is really courteous. The decor is top notch. Love the ambience of the place. And again do try the Irani Chai if you're here.
Karachi Cafe,Shubhangi Gautam,29 October 2018,4,"I'm OBSESSED with the Irani Chai at Karachi Cafe. The first time I had Irani Chai was here and I fell in love with the place. My friend and I come here once in a while to catch up and we just love this Cafe. It's so cute, quiet, and very pretty. I love the theme. I'm not really sure how the food is. We've had their Mawa cake which goes great with the Chai and the paneer sub which wasn't that great. But nonetheless, it's one of my favorite places."
Karachi Cafe,Karthik Vempa,16 October 2018,5,"Another place where I wanted to visit from long. This is vintage, brings back your childhood days (only if you are a 90s or earlier born ;)). Excellent place ambience and tasty food. Their rolls are yummy and keem pav is a must try dish."
Karachi Cafe,Hrishikesh Mohile,13 October 2018,5,"Back with review as I promised
The Kheema Pav is amazing and a must try .....

Nice retro ambiance, very well done. The interiors has been very carefully done, love the paint on walls and the props used.
Didn't get much time to spend but would definitely love to spend more time at this place.
The crew is friendly too...
Will write about food after my next visit ..."
Karachi Cafe,Aman Agarwal,11 October 2018,3,Nice place to go for a casual snacks and smoothies. Rate is slightly higher but the food quality is okay. Dinning space is very good. One can seat outside watch the road and enjoy the food as well
Karachi Cafe,Bhargavi Neti,11 October 2018,5,"A really nice place for a date! Ambience is very good - old songs playing in the background, antique looking showpieces hanging all around. Food is great too! Tried pasta, sandwich and samosa here, and they were good."
Karachi Cafe,Trisha Mondal,10 October 2018,3,"Nice place to hangout with ur frnds over a cup of irani chai and endless gossips..
Very affordable and usually very busy place.
Must try bun maska here."
Karachi Cafe,Tamal Sarkar,07 October 2018,5,"Starting off I was amazed by the looks and ambience of the place from the side of the road ! So I was anticipating it !

On a sunny Sunday morning I convinced my friends to come down here !

The ambience and the themed decorations was fascinating and how they maintained it so well and beautifully
The kettle shaped water jug and the bulb shaped salt containers the rough and old furniture look and the old Bollywood movie dialogue and old popular brands ! All of it put together was so so appealing to me !
The old big radio and the dial up Telephones brought back so many childhood memories !

Coming to what we ordered

BBQ chicken Sub
Chicken 65 Sub
Omlette Sandwich
Crispy Chicken burgers
Apple pie with Vanilla ice cream

The first thing that as lovely about each of these(except Apple pie of course) that they were whole some and there were generous amount of French fries t and wedges to go along with the mains !

I had the burger and it was damn fulfilling
Crispy square chicken patties and layered with veggies and lettuce, it was really nice! however to be critical it could have done with more cheese or mayonnaise !

The Subs were spicy and had substantial chicken pieces and the omlette Sandwich was pretty decent too !
Overall I felt the pocket pinch was quite normal for a cafe ! At least the food satisfied our appetite !

P.S. - They took their theme very seriously and that shows when you enter the washroom !
You'll find a old Rexona ad in a frame !

All in all the place seemed perfect for all occasions for a romantic date or getaway
For a group outing for people who love Ambience and for random tea meet ups as well !

Must Visit !! üòöüòçüòçüòçüòé"
Karachi Cafe,Shovan M,06 October 2018,4,"Yesterday it was a good evening we spent at Karachi Cafe along with the entire team. It's a very decent place for discussion, eating or for a date.

We ordered various things like samosas, chicken kobirazi, veg cutlet, paneer kathi roll, macaroni sandwich, veg grilled sandwich etc. All the items were very good and pretty tasty. The Irani chai was fabulous.

It's a place with the theme old is gold, so you can see pictures from the past hanging on the walls.
All of you can try out this place as it's located very near to IT offices.
Service was good, cost wise also it's not very high. Would like to taste some more items from the menu."
Karachi Cafe,Ria Sur,04 October 2018,3,Food is good and also service. If someone wants to have a touch of Bengali food this is the place. Also dinner can be completed in some reasonable price
Karachi Cafe,Karan Parseja,01 October 2018,5,"Old is the New New! üñ§
A 19th Century themed Caf√© which has a soothing ambiance, it will remind some of you of your childhood. Posters, advertisements, scenes from the past are framed and put up all over the 4 walls. The food is is amazing, I went for the Pink Penne Grilled Chicken Pasta and we couldn't resist finishing it even though we were half full. Lemon Tea (Barfeilly Chai) is a refreshing mix.
Must Visit as this place will definitely uplift your mood."
Karachi Cafe,Nishanth Reddy,26 September 2018,4,"Had pizza at near by pizza hut and badly wanted to have a dessert, so randomly choose this place to have dessert. We‚Äôve ordered victoria cake slice and old fashion chocolate cake, and we deeply liked them both. Interior theme should be mentioned here specially, its rustic, antique and has a distinctive style to it. Must try place"
Karachi Cafe,Satya Mounica,24 September 2018,4,"Ordered Barbecue Mushroom Sandwich and Mawa Cake. The mushroom stuffing in sandwich was sweet, tangy and spicy. Potato wedges were given as a side for sandwich. It tasted good and the Mawa Cake was fine too. They were of reasonable price. Overall it was a good experience."
Karachi Cafe,Krishnendu Kundu,23 September 2018,4,4 for the ambience and the biscuits. The taste of the Irani chai and mawa cake can be improved by at least 4/10 levels. But the brand name really works.
Karachi Cafe,Purnima Khanna,16 September 2018,3,"Ordered red sacuce pasta and got white sauce pasta by mistake .

Rate
Pasta 5/2.5

However delivery was quite quick ordered from swiggy and also got a refund same time for delivering wrong order ."
Karachi Cafe,MONISH BHARGAV,16 September 2018,4,"Si please place with simple food, reminds of those good old days before technology took over. Best place to come over for a chai and a conversation.
Fine biscuit, Irani chai and roohafza are my favourites here."
Karachi Cafe,Madhanpr,15 September 2018,2,Went there with a friend on a weekday evening. Ordered bbq chicken and nizami roll. The chicken in both dishes did not taste good and was not fresh. Irani chai was not up to the mark. Cost wise its on the higher side and not worth it. Overall a bad experience.
Karachi Cafe,Sanjay Kumar,13 September 2018,4,"This branch along with one at Madhapur and in forum mall is one of the better and upmarket Karanchi joint. This is just below the diners pavilion and next to Paradise. Quite a good offering of bakery and light snacks with a sitting area at the back. Place for light snacks, pastries and muffins"
Karachi Cafe,Bhavik Parikh,09 September 2018,4,"One of the first thing that one would notice as soon as you enter in this cafe is the sense of nostalgia with old school themed pictures and walls which makes for a great ambience. The food here is also very good, specially pasta sandwich and mava cake are must try."
Karachi Cafe,Anita Maji,08 September 2018,2,"Visited this place for an early lunch, as every other nearby place dint start serving.

Ambience looked classic with those vintage vibes.

Ordered penne in Alfredo sauce which took 40 mins for them to serve. It tasted average. It was loaded with way too much of cheese which I don't expect in pastas (I wouldn't mind that if it was a pizza though)."
Karachi Cafe,Divya Pasumarthy,05 September 2018,5,"Absolutely loved the place, the food, aesthetics everything! I was pretty lost looking at the antiques and having veg cutlet with filter coffee. Thought it was expensive while looking at the menu but the quantity was pretty good. Much recommended."
Karachi Cafe,HyderabadiGluttons,05 September 2018,3,"The perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon with your loved one. This retro Cafe will rewind you back to the 70s. Ambience is the USP of this cozy little cafe. Old classics playing in the background would soothe you with nostalgia.

We settled for an Irani Chai coupled with Mawa cake. While the tea was top notch, the cake was just about average. Service is very good.

Overall, one of those places where ambience can pull you again and again"
Karachi Cafe,Astha Sharma,03 September 2018,4,"If u r looking for a place to chill and relax, this is the place. Fruit juices are fresh. Ordered bombay sandwich which was worth the money. Ambience is nice and service too. Overall
Food - 4
Ambience - 4
Service - 4
Can be re-visited- Yes"
Karachi Cafe,Nupur Rani,03 September 2018,4,"A cafe by the legendary Karachi Bakery,it lives upto the name. The ambience literally transports you to old times with posters from old brands and smallest of details taken care of. Like the television and telephone from the old times that no one uses now are a part of the decor. Service is also good with prompt and courteous staff. Food presentation is good and taste wise, can't say much as we only tried the Irani chai (which was really good). Overall, a really good experience."
Karachi Cafe,Lakshmi P,01 September 2018,4,"Lovely decor. The service is slow. But the staff are good. Love the menu here. Pocket friendly prices.
We tried out the Chicken Kabiraji, BBQ chicken sub, Paneer chicken sub and the nizami khati roll.
Loved the taste. The quantity was perfect too."
Karachi Cafe,Jalaj Goyal,01 September 2018,4,"It was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in Indira Nagar area when we encountered Karachi Cafe!! As you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s-90s era. The wall paint, bit rugged, and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era. To submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! The old melodies make you just go wow!!

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji and Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta!!
Let's discuss each in an order.

Chicken Kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!

Next delicacy, Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta. Remotely similar taste of pasta which I experienced was a long time back. The blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. The quantity was great for two.

I would suggest to visit this place with good hopes and do try other items on the list!!

Karachi Cafe,Ramya Sruthi,27 August 2018,2,Had cutlet.... was a big let down!! üëé can do better with the taste. Even the accompaniment is a normal store bought ketchup!!! Menu could be listed as ‚Äòbeet root ‚Äò cutlet instead of cutlet to prepare the mind.
Karachi Cafe,Ierum Imam,26 August 2018,5,"I Like the Food. I would like to Come. Againüëçüòä
Though the service was a little slow and it was a buzzing place. The Irani chai was awesome.
-Zain"
Karachi Cafe,Ankit Singh,25 August 2018,4,"I visit karachi bakery regularly for biscuits and sweets. This cafe is located on the same road as the karachi bakery outlet.
The cafe has a brilliant old school charm, which will take you back in time. Posters of old films and redundant brands are all over the walls of this cafe.
This place serves the best irani chai, period. The mawa cake was decent too. Osmania biscuits, as usual tasted brilliant.
Irani chai, osmania biscuits, and mawa cake is a brilliant combination.
People with an ‚Äúold school taste‚Äù can definitely try this cafe."
Karachi Cafe,Simran Swain,24 August 2018,5,The interiors and the ambience are lovely. Perfect old bollywood music is soothing. The food is great. The presentation and the service both.

Karachi Cafe,Srishti Bhardwaj | Exploring Life Tastes,20 August 2018,3,"Quality of food was average, although the service of the staff needs a little improvement. I had to wait for long duration even for a glass of water.
Potato wedges - 4.5/5
Penne alfredo - 3.5/5

Karachi Cafe,Rohith Koundinya,19 August 2018,2,"Went there with good expectations.. coz I have been here many tyms but felt of writing a review today coz food was baad.. mainly standards...Bun Maska in initial days it used be best but now I didn't find it great, but ok.. kheema pav was today best I can say.. had bheja n roti as well, it was well cooked but missed the actual flavours of the spices, I some how liked the Hyderabadi style but one can try Irani style here..I didn't like the Irani chai one can get a better chai outside small local cafes.. well maintained ambience.. overall it was average with taste n flavors.. may I need to try some more dishes....ü§ò"
Karachi Cafe,Ahmedconstruction2017,15 August 2018,5,"An amazing cafe by karachi bakers, each and every corner was used in a much different way, a very retro theme was given with all the vintage pieces placed, interior was very colorful and the yummiest part was the food, i tried the pasta sandwiches which were just mind blowing! A must try place."
Karachi Cafe,Karan Dadure,14 August 2018,5,"This cafe has a retro feel and it carries it very well.

Their speciality, baida roti, a stuffed paratha is AMAZING!!"
Karachi Cafe,Dhruv Gupta,12 August 2018,4,"The ambience reminds you of all the 90's things; Old movies posters, brands, etc. Tried Irani Chai,Bun Maska, Dum Ki Chai(strong tea), mushroom sandwich, crispy chicken burger and Mutton Keema Pav. The food is really nice but you will have to wait a bit longer for the food to be on your table.

Karachi Cafe,Vinay Srivastava,10 August 2018,5,"This place is as perfect as a cafe can be. It's beautiful, soothing, and calms you down.
The ambiance, walls, furniture is all old fashioned, would remind you of the old Parsi cafes in Goa or Bombay. They play old Bollywood music of 1970s, which blends perfectly with the mood. The staff is extremely courteous.
We were two of us, and we ordered so much. Irani chai, Bombay khari, fruit nankhatai, maska bun, keema pav, rice-Veg-khuchamber raita combo, and a sweet lime juice. Everything tastes delicious!
The portions are limited, and the prices are a bit on the higher side, but all in all it's totally worth it. This is going to be my 'go to place' in the city from now on."
Karachi Cafe,Shivam Khanna,29 July 2018,4,the whole package was upside down
Karachi Cafe,Aam Admi,29 July 2018,5,"Nice old school ambiance. Irani chai n biscuits are very nice. Fav tried and tasted dishes- chicken sandwich, Bheja fry, irani chai, paneer burji, Bombay biscuits and fruit buiscuits. Very weird but true- pasta is amazing.

Karachi Cafe,Ghanvir,24 July 2018,2,"The Chicken Kabiraji was too greasy, I cannot rinse off the oil.

The Famous Kolkata Style Fish Roll was tasteless and dry.
And to top it the delivery was not packed correctly, the yellow mustard sauce was spilled all over."
Karachi Cafe,Bharath Manapragada,23 July 2018,4,"Gone there with high expectations bcoz of the brand ‚ÄúKarachi‚Äù.

Karachi Cafe,Suman Ghosh,17 July 2018,4,"Excellent irani onion samosas, didn't like the chat masala sprinkled at the top though."
Karachi Cafe,Indira Chekuri,14 July 2018,1,"I've ordered their Keema Pav on Swiggy and I was very dissatisfied with it. The keema was stale and blubbery. Their is lot of fat and meat was very minimal. I couldn't finish even half of the portion served. And it was very clear that the dish/mutton is not fresh. Please check with them if you really wanna try this dish.
PS: It had a bad effect on my tummy as well."
Karachi Cafe,Shibu Messi,10 July 2018,1,too much of salt n oil ....not even good quality of bread
Karachi Cafe,Aditya Lambe,06 July 2018,4,Awsome
Karachi Cafe,Md Abid Khan,06 July 2018,3,Place is good but they are charging too much cost. Better to go Paradise as compared to Karachi Cafe. If you have too much money then you should go to this place.
Karachi Cafe,Jyoti Singh,28 June 2018,3,"chicken 65 is a Chinese dish , I don't understand why do you have to out curry leaves in it."
Karachi Cafe,Chetan P,27 June 2018,1,Delivery boy said that he met with an accident. Food got spill out of packed box
Karachi Cafe,Benazeer Khan,27 June 2018,4,"We saw their iftar special menu on zomato and went for iftar. To our surprise, the staff was not even aware of the word iftar. So we ordered from their regular menu. The service is quick, food is really tasty. The liveliness of the cafe and the retro music would surely boost your spirits!"
Karachi Cafe,Sidhant Girglani,25 June 2018,4,"Would visit this place again just for the calmness and memories it's ambience take you back to. The menu is limited, doesn't spoil you with choice and that might be blocker for you to visit the place repeatedly.

The service and the taste of the food both were decent and nothing to complain of.

If you love savouring snacks from the old City with a cup of tea, this is the place to be. Though there are places which give you a better taste for the same things in the menu, they don't offer the ambience of this cafe.

Visit this place when you aren't that hungry and want to unwind with a snack n a cup of tea."

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Veggie-Lover,14 April 2019,4,"Big fan of All day Breakfast in bed? Order from this amazing little eatery!

From vegetarian heart shaped nutella pancakes to a classic English breakfast with omelettes and hash browns they‚Äôve got it all.

They also have a dine-in available if you wish to drop by. Not to mention the place also whips up some amazing shawarma and rice combos.

Juices to coffee, they‚Äôve got everything you need. All this without burning a hole in your pocket.

In picture:

I had ordered their Nutella Pancakes and coffee: the packaging was perfect and the Nutella was well smothered. The coffee hadn‚Äôt leaked either.
While the pancakes were true to being eggless the baking soda/powder was slightly overpowering. But still manages to be one of the best eggless pancakes joint for me."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Anuj Rajani,13 April 2019,4,"As of now, I have tried 2 rice bowls and 1 shawarma from here -
1) non veg green slimy monster bowl
2) veg the iron monster bowl
3) desi original chicken shawarma

All 3 of them i liked a lot, especially 1) and 3).

Me being a healthy food eating person, instructions of using less oil and less chilli were correctly taken into account by the restaurant and the taste also was great.

Quality and quantity were both quite satisfying. Great job.üëåüèªüëçüèª

One suggestion from my side will be to add calories, ingredients and nutritients information (for ex: protein, fat, carbs content; micro nutrients information) for each dish being offered. This will be very helpful for everyone especially for people like me who want to eat clean and healthy."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Subhashree Dey,11 April 2019,3,I ordered Red Monster box mini for 95 rupees. 4 pieces of fried chicken were there. The taste was good. There was another box which had chicken makhani with biryani rice. The quantity was very less. It was not enough for one person. And the taste was also not so great.
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Sheri M John,10 April 2019,4,"The place might seem small from outside, but you have quite a good space for seating inside. The place had offers when we went and we had veg and non veg rolls which were okay okay. The waffles here are amazing.
Must try the waffles here."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Mahi Prince,19 March 2019,5,Rice bowls and shawarmas are very good.and tasty i had a chicken sabbha shawarama and iron monster rice bowl it had very tastey.. Nice restaurant amazing rice bowls delicious food

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,PJ Hari,17 March 2019,2,"I read about this place in best shawarmas listing in Google. And Ordered peri peri chicken shawarma. It's average because i regularly eat shah ghouse one's. For sure, shah ghouse is a lot better than this. And there is no reason to prefer this over that.

And for the coke drink they took 60rs for a 20rs bottle. Seriously?"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,The Foodie Bookworm,06 March 2019,4,"So i make videos on YouTube on food and books and the name of my channel is TheFoodie Bookworm and I just ordered randomly from the place because it was similar to the name of my channel, but I must say that I am super satisfied with the chicken Peri peri shawarma and the pancakes. They are just yumm. Do try this place out."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Nidhi,06 March 2019,1,Ordered for brownie which was completely dry and was not fresh at all. Choco banana Waffle was okay not so good. They send the food in big box which looks like will have good quantity. But will get a small piece and that is too tasteless
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Crezy Pavan,05 March 2019,5,Just now I have ordered chicken strips and pancake combo we like the food from here and chicken strips was crispy I like to order food from this restaurant
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Prasad Kayal,01 March 2019,3,Best place to order pan cakes in town. I have tried the pan cake with maple syrup and I must confess it was really good. The price is also reasonable.
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Indradipta Sardar,11 February 2019,4,"Earlier my personal favorite was cupid crunchy chicken rice bowl. But recently i noticed that the taste has changed, the gravy is sour and the Chicken pieces are not crispy as they used to be."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Shubham Srivastava,09 February 2019,1,"No maple syrup with pancakes and waffles.
If no maple syrup is to be included in your combo please specify it but serving pancakes and waffles without syrup or anything else is simply not acceptable. This is the second time this has happened."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ankita,08 February 2019,4,"Located near DLF, IIIT - This small place is mostly for Swiggy orders. Interior is simple and cosy. We had combo deals booked through Dineout. We were supposed to have pizza squares but they had run out of it. So they offered another shawarma instead. Shawarma and nuggets were served first. After waiting for sometime we got the mint cooler and waffles.

Food is tasty and delicious. However service is bit slow.

Will recommend for online delivery from comfort of home. Combo deals are really easy on pocket."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Sonali Kallani,28 January 2019,3,"We dropped at this place on Sunday morning for breakfast. It's a small cafe with quirky posters and phases on the wall which will definitely catch your attention.
Coming to food, we ordered two combos : shawarma + Nutella waffle + citrus mint cooler and best of both worlds. We also tried spiced bell pepper omelette which was really good. Other items were average, nothing great. Quantity of the food was good.

Ambience - 3.5/5

+ their waffles and fried chicken is a great way to start the day too"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Amulya,26 January 2019,3,"I ordered French toast but didnt taste like french toast.Chef team can work on this for a better output. There are very few places where french toast is available, if the taste is improved this place can lead."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Dhawal Lingam,26 January 2019,1,"I ordered a green chicken rice bowl (large).it had less than 10gms of chicken forget about the box size ,shawarma would have had more quantity.I don't know what would I have got if I said small portion.Totally bad experience."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Arjun Dhingra,20 January 2019,2,"First Impressions: Not a place for breakfast for sure. They aren't ready for dine in customers.
Tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before I placed the order). I checked in at 8 40 am!
Ambience is a great miss for sure. Super duper uncomfortable seats.
Add:
The pancakes are very average. Could be more fluffy.
They did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
Eggs: shambles not scrambled. Over salty in places. No salt in rest of the place. Why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
Tea: the only reason I beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. Lovely tea. Quite a hassle btw for just tea though üòÇ"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Anish Mahapatra || Thefoodpotato,17 January 2019,4,"I had ordered 2 varieties of shawarma. The order reached on time. The packaging was good and the Shawarmas itself were hot, creamy and delicious. It was wrapped in foil paper and quantity was sufficient wrt price. I used the 50%off coupon from Zomato. I recommend this place.

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ashay Deep Kulshrestha,22 December 2018,1,"Just ordered special desi chicken shawarma from this place and was the worst shawarma i had lately, very very less chicken filling and dull flavour. Not at all worth the price."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Syed Ahmed,10 December 2018,4,"A good place to have value for money food , the staff is quick to respond and polite , what I didn't like was the hygiene as some kind of foul smell was in the restaurant also the lights are not up to the mark which needs to be improved and the temperature inside was kind of hot even in winter.

When it comes to food it is very good with good cost and tasty , we had desi shawarma , Peri Peri and chilli garlic shawarma regular size , all of them were really tasty , their other options are also a must try."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Mounika Boddeti,09 December 2018,4,"Ordered pancake breakfast combo, quality and packing of food is really good, one of the best English breakfast for reasonable cost, Delivery was also quick."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Nalin Venkat Sameera,01 December 2018,4,"I aplogize for posting the review so late (after a year or so) but yes, the memories are still fresh in my mind. I must say that this one is actually very special to me.

This is the first place I came with my best friend. He forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food. Shawarmas. That was it. I saw that I could try the vegetarian version here, so I was happy.

We had our respective types of Shawarmas: he had chicken and I was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one. We got to listen to good music, hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas. It was good food, good company and a great experience. Just that, it can hurt your pocket a little!"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ramyakanagala23,26 November 2018,4,"Ordered online..

If you hate those colorful add ons on the food same as me, better to instruct them before, as they add those on all items üò†ü§£
Apart from that all good
Fav here: Pancakes and waffles.

Speed of Delivery: 4"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Charushila Biswas,18 November 2018,4,"Ordered classic waffle from the foodie monster kitchen, Gachibowli and it was so yummm! Beautiful balanced taste, no overpowering egg smell, a little crisp outside and soft and fluffy inside. Plus, the prices are also reasonable. Good find, will order from here again."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Saurabh Bose,12 November 2018,1,"I ordered garlic bread and cheesy fries with lots of hope since it had a 4.0 rating in zomato but sadly it disappointed me to the core , the garlic bread was as small as good day biscuits and very hard to bite while the cheesy fries were very cold and not at all consumable!"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Shiva Charan,08 November 2018,2,"I've ordered chicken pizza squares (6pc). I waited for almost 20 mins. They served 6pc of sandwich bread topped with some chicken. I thought that they've served it by mistake. I asked the staff and they confirmed that the served thing is called ""Pizza"".
I wish the name in the menu is changed to something else.. or mentioning the recipe beside name could help in choosing the right food."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ritika Malani,17 October 2018,4,"The food undoubtedly tasted amazing - ordered Crunchy Rice Bowl. Will definitely order again. However the delivery was delayed by around half an hour, so, work on the delivery time. Food is great anyways‚ù§"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Rahul Gupta,15 October 2018,4,"Loved it.

The shwarmas, the fries, the garlic bread and all the amazing dips that they serve are lip-smacking!! 

After eating his full course, one still craves to eat more... That's how tasty it is. 

Cheers!!"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Bhargavi Neti,13 October 2018,3,"It's a small funky place, with funky chairs and tables. It's a lot bigger than it seems from outside. A low key place with less people traffic. Food is average. It's self service there. So overall it's an okay place."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Dhruv Sharma,12 October 2018,1,"A sincere request, don't try waffles from here. Tried a Nutella waffles priced at Rs 199 and they just put half a spoon of Nutella on three quarters of waffle. Expected a lot more, disappointed."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Chandra Kiran Reddy Palla,07 October 2018,4,"This place is very common to the corporate people who work in DLF and its premises for its reasonable price and food with perfect quantity and quality .The only thing i would suggest everyone is do not opt takeaway/homedelivery for waffles because when hot waffles are made they are immediately stored in plastic boxes due to which hot air is released by the waffles and condenses in the box itself thus it becomes very soft and disgusting to eat .I have ordered Best of both worlds (Reg. Waffles,pancakes,scrambled eggs and cold coffee)and Veg iron monster(panneer biryani and coke) pancakes were yummy along with maple sauce,scrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oil.panneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavoured.Cold coffee tasted like regular one.Packing quality needs to be improved."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Himanshi Jain,06 October 2018,1,They just cancelled the order after an hour. This was not at all justified and not at all accepted. Had a very bad first experience of the restaurant
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Jithin C R,25 September 2018,3,ice cream low in waffle treat
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Stuti Maji,24 September 2018,1,Ordered peri peri fries online today . The fries were damp and cold. A suggestion to the restaurant to please not to accept orders if you cannot maintain quality
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Megha Shukla,22 September 2018,2,Kindly try putting more stuffing in the waffles.. we ordered two but it was all bread hence couldn't eat any. Ice cream waffle was all melted.. kindly remove it from online if we are unable to deliver with dry ice. Banana caramel waffle was all dry.. expecting better qualities for the next order. Thanks a lot!!
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Praful,20 September 2018,4,"Had one of those afternoon sweet cravings, so tried this place. I ordered a Caramel Banana Pancake

Add On : Maple Syrup. I also received a mini waffle for free thanks to zomato free dessert offer. Both the items are really yummy. I would love to try more from here :)"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Jayanth Majety,19 September 2018,4,"Have ordered their Mocha Waffle and not very impressed with their packing.

Expected it to be on the softer side considering the time it would take for delivery. Even then, it tasted good.

And the Peri Peri fries too.

Have bookmarked this place to visit and what a time to give it a try.

Will look forward to order again."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Sunil Kaushik,19 September 2018,5,The breakfast was delicious. Though tea was extra sweet but overall the flavour and aroma was great. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Great conversation on phone as I modified the order after order was placed.

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Udit Mittal,13 September 2018,2,Extremely soggy and no flavour at all. Worst waffle i had
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,The Fit Foodie üòãüòéü§ë,11 September 2018,4,"Delivery review
What I ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which I choose tea
Price - 199 plus taxes.
Food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. Waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down üëá. Tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. Special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 üåüüåüüåü for me. Over all if u r health conscious may be it's an absolute visit for u but for me 3 and half for now till next time."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Priyal Jain,09 September 2018,5,"Service is horrible, the food is good tho. I don't recommend going here to eat, but ordering from or just coming mid day is fine. The eggs were well made."

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ankita Dixit,08 September 2018,3,"Been to this place for breakfast . Choose pancake/waffle breakfast combo.

All in all I can say pocket friendly place with decent food."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Aman Tyagi,04 September 2018,1,"Pathetic food. Omelete is having black color on it. Breads are missing. Strawberry toast , something white is there which smells. Pathetic food . Yakk. Such bad experience. Delivery boy also came 1 hour late. Never gonna order from here ."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Priya Ch,02 September 2018,4,"I have ordered Cajun Omlet from this place. It tasted delicious. Over the time, the quality has declined but immediately it was taken care of when it has been taken to their notice. Their customer orientation is much appreciated."

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Vinay,10 August 2018,3,"Located in such a place where numerous food courts are available, their menu is a real eye catcher. Pocket friendly with decent quality & quantity.
Talking about the taste, we ordered chicken shawarma combo and rice bowl combo. The taste of shawarma didn‚Äôt reach our expectations but the rice bowl combo was really good! Need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high!
Regarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn‚Äôt working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.
Management has to look after these issues. Their ambience is good and clean! Spent some quality time.
Food:3.5
Service :3.0
Re-visit: wanna try their whole menu!"

Fruit pebble shake was the one which I ordered using Zomato but I think they delivered me the wrong one.
The shake has the taste of chocolate cookies, so it was definitely not fruit.

Irrespective of that, the taste of the shake was average and I think they can improve their bar."

All the rice bowls(both veg and non veg), the varieties of omlette, waffels(monster egg and monster chicken), different types of shawarmas, french fries and banana pancakes.

We went here to bid farewell to one of our friend and tried all the above varieties. All turn out be yummy!!! Simple and sober.

The crews were very friendly and the ambience is super!!!"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Dhiraj Goswami,04 July 2018,5,Superb Cooperation and order customization
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Suhani Bhasin,03 July 2018,3,the Restaurant didn't follow the special instructions mentioned
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Divya Reddy,02 July 2018,3,I had ordered out everytime. The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish. The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken. The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist. There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette. Also their waffles are okayish too.
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Amanjot Kaur,01 July 2018,3,"I had pancakes there, although they were beautiful plated and heart shaped but taste was not that up to the mark. They were bit spongy instead of smooth texture."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ankit K Maheshwari,01 July 2018,5,"Had a great experience. Good place on wekend.
If you want to enjoy some awesome food, TFMK is the name.
Ambience of the place makes it a perfect choice to visit with family."
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Preetam Srikar,30 June 2018,2,"shawarma isn't actually a shawarma, it's more
like a frankie"
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Dave Ria,29 June 2018,1,How can they not give my full delivery. You forgot to deliver my full order.
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Nissy,27 June 2018,5,Food is awesome. It will be great if they allow us to order each item separately instead of just combos.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vikram Gundraju,17 May 2019,1,"Worst service, food is not good. And people are not polite here. Very slow service. Not preffered for professional parties. Only appearance is good"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,D J Sunny,14 May 2019,5,"This is my third time visiting this place..
Good ambience for couples..
Food is absolutely amazing..
HIRAK the staff member is impressive with his attitude and friendly nature..
Good place for weekend partying"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Princy Doshi,14 May 2019,5,"Music is good, Dance floor is quiet big. Staffs are very friendly. Drinks are cheap and good. Do try veg Manchurian as starters it was mind blowing."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vivek Menon,08 May 2019,3,Place is a bit small and the music is too loud. Ambience is ok. Food is good and they have a very courteous staff. The rates are quite resonable.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Pradeep,04 May 2019,5,I like this place as it offers quite good buffet with better options and at reasonable price and quite near to my work place. Drinks prices are some what reasonable
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Chandan Mashetty,03 May 2019,3,Been here with the team .. felt that it‚Äôs a not a place for buffet.. in starters only chicken wings was good .. in main course chicken biryani was good..desserts was ok..
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Aditya Dixit,29 April 2019,4,"Nice place to hang out on a weekday with your colleagues. The orders get served quickly and service is courteous. Good choice of music as well, so overall a place I would definitely visit again."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Pratipurna Panda,29 April 2019,3,"The name is so appealing that when we saw it,we were like, yes let's go.
Because all of us just looovee the movie üòÅ
But also because it's on a busy roadside. Very convenient location.

It was Wednesday and had a ladies night I think. But as you know, gold can't be availed with ladies' night privileges üòî

We got seating very easily. Don't know of that was a good thing or bad, because the place was very empty. Only 2 other tables were seated I think.

Ambience is okay.. music- can be better. Cocktails were good. You can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it.
Service- can be better. was slow , when you look there were very less crowd.
Food is very nice. Pocket friendly place.

Hope next time I get to see a good crowd and good music"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Digvijay Singh,27 April 2019,1,"So now this has left me with no option but to write a review after coordinating with the manager Mr. Rounaq Ali to get my 678 + taxes INR back for the incorrect billing. I made the payment for a total amount and when I got back home realised that the bar used my Zomato gold coupon but didn't apply to the final billing. Utter disappointment. They need to ensure that they don't do an incorrect billing as everyone has trust. Sorry to say it failed here.
K"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Priyambada Choudhury,27 April 2019,4,Definitely recommend their kebabs n dance floor used to be one of my favorites. Their service is prompt and it offers decent mocktails. However I would love to see some signature drinks on the menu. Definitely recommend.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Rishant Garg,27 April 2019,4,"Food here is really good, but only problem is the lightning, it is directly above you and becomes annoying sometimes.
But in all i had a good time there"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Snehasish Behera,20 April 2019,4,"I had visited this place for their lunch buffet which is priced at Rs. 499 + taxes. They had 3 veg starters (paneer tikka, Hara bhara kebab and Spring roll) and 3 non-veg starters (chicken tikka, fish 65) and also an elaborate main course. For the price that they offer the food is pretty good and definitely a go to place if you want to enjoy a buffet."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Pratyush Madhukar,15 April 2019,1,"We were 5 friends and I specifically called to ask if stags are allowed. Manager told that stags are allowed. Once we reached, the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor. I called manager again he also denied entry. I can't understand why can't they clarify the same on call. I spent so much money on cab only to be denied entry. La la Land sucks."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Avinash Kumar,15 April 2019,1,"Pathetic customer service. We called and enquired if stag entry was allowed and they said yes. Once we reached here, stag entry was not entertained. When we told we had already called before coming, they said we will allow stag but not dance floor. Why the hell you can't clarify all your nonsense rules over call"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Subha Mahapatra,08 April 2019,1,"The most horrible and disgusting place I have ever been to. They have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served. The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English. The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. When we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like ""if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?"" I lost it and I was telling my friend, I repeat, I was talking to my friend stating ""what the fuck is wrong with this place"" is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language. I was like, WHAT? ""I"" am talking to ""my friend"" about the ""place"" What's your problem in that? And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ""ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo."" So that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. Don't be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review. But yeah, if u think u can reach Ali a nice lesson, please go ahead, all my blessings are with you üòã"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,P Raghuraj,04 April 2019,5,This place is one of the finest place and a great attraction is thursday karaoke nights which has been a main attraction and a crowd puller. Please continue this trend and keep up the good work. Courteous staff and KJ akshay is a friendly guy...entertains all....this place is great to unwind after days of hard work. Please continue and dont ever stop karaokes.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Shravani Reddy,04 April 2019,1,The disgusting part is the manager Ali.Such a disgusting disrespecting person to his customers. Will never visit this place again. The problem is if the manager is so rude just imagine how rude the staff can be
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Tushar Bhushan,04 April 2019,3,"Environment was kinda boxed in ,which was not so appealing  to feeling of being relax ,but food was great ,beer was cold.Cocktails were not so great but then there was a AC in smoking room so yes it can be rated as 3 star"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Kaushani Roy Choudhury,29 March 2019,4,"The food was pretty standard and the service was good. Ambiance is quite good and the food is worth the price.
The only thing that annoyed me to the core was the DJ. The DJ played awful songs which honestly killed my mood.
Otherwise a good experience."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Adhiraa Naidu,28 March 2019,4,"A small cozy place with a dim ambience and loud like very loud music, perfect for a bunch friends to hangout. Drinks and food were good but I felt it was a bit pricey. Overall, we had a good time. Oh ! Did I mention they‚Äôve a dance floor too?üòÉ"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sukant Dash,24 March 2019,2,"We went for lunch buffet. 
Very limited options for starter - 3 non-veg(2 chicken and 1 fish) and 3 veg(2 potato and 1 paneer). they were serving the starter cold. The tawa fish was over spicy and they didn't prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request. Only chicken wings was good.

Main course was kind of good. Egg fried rice and veg noodles were good. Chicken biriyani was stale.

Dessert was good. Chocolate cake, gulaab jamoon and Ice cream were good. Semiya kheer was horrible."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Ashish,10 March 2019,1,"Well sometimes rating can be misleading. We visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine.
The Beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of Corona bucket. Bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled. Well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp. We were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp. And the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer.

We asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had Dragon chicken served. Eating it all I can say if it's ur best then your worst is not for humans.

Next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud.

All i can say if you know what a good food, ambiance and hang out place Never ever visit this place."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mitesh Agarwal,09 March 2019,4,"They have a good amount of space with decent ambience for large gathering, dance floor and a value for price. I have been there couple of times and really like their starters specially cheese starter. üôÉ I do hate their spicy potato starter as it just burns your taste buds. ‚òπÔ∏è
Service is also good and I love their all 99 Tuesday menu for starters and drinks as it‚Äôs all the worth. However, they should maintain consistency in having all those limited menu items available and not just make an attractive Tuesday menu for sake of it.
4 üåü mostly because the value for tasty food is worth it. Hopefully in next visit they don‚Äôt say we don‚Äôt have cheese starters in limited Tuesday Menu! üòõ"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sphurti Joglekar,07 March 2019,4,Good food and service as well as classy ambience but music was too loud . I went on a date with my husband here and we had an over all good time . We really liked peanut masala and cocktail collection(2+2 zomato worked perfectly!) . Pepper chicken and corn fritters were good and spicy!
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Surya Tej Kanuri,05 March 2019,3,"*go here only if you want to drink and dance. Not a place for casual chat*

Food - 5/7
Ambiance -4/7 ( tooooo loud music)
Service - 5/7
VFM - 4/7

We went there for dinner and I was hoping it to be as good as the movie La La land.. But couldn't bear the extremely loud music at all.. It's impossible to talk even with the person sitting next to you..

Though the taste was decent, we couldn't enjoy the food for the same reason.."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Lakshmi Sona,01 March 2019,1,"Very bad service and worst food they showing with coke but they didn't send taste is very bad.dont go this restaurant
Very very bad experience with this restaurant"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Santosh,28 February 2019,1,"We wen
t for lunch ala carta today ordered couple of non-veg starters and veg starters, all of them are salty and uncooked. The quality is also not fresh, they are smelly. The chicken sheekh kebab is full of dough and no chicken in it.

The main course is also awful and the chicken dum biryani is not actually dum biryani it is pulao.

Please avoid this place

The star ratings are fake"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vasu Deva Reddy,27 February 2019,2,"This is my regular hangout place with my office buddies. The food was good thats the only reason for these 2 stars. But this review I'm writing is after a worst experience in this place. Last friday we have been to this place and we were looking at menu. my friend asked for a drink but floor manager said they don't have that brand. Then he asked for another brand again same reply. Then we looked at food menu and ordered chicken lolly pop then floor manager angrily said this is not local bar to ask everything whatever u eat outside. Then we literally got angry and said this is in your menu that's the only reason we are asking for it. Then he kept mum. We were literally pissed off by that floor manager behaviour and decided not to visit that place again.
Management need to take action against that floor manager or else they will lose some more regular visitors in future."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Akhila Akhi,24 February 2019,1,"This ppl were very irresponsible. There swiping machine was not working.
But still they have asked us to enter pin for almost 3-4 times
I have shown a person there that the money was deducted but still he was not agreeing and asked us to do again..
Nd said if it happens the money will be returned back in 24hrs
But actually very disappointing is
We went there on Feb 23rd btw 7 to 8: 15
We got a email that there

Today on Feb 24th at 10am 11: 03am the money was again deducted..
Am asking you very politely if you return them back it's okay..
Or else am gonna file a case for fraud transaction"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Love Mishra,17 February 2019,2,"Food-5/10
Ambience -5.5/10
Staff-0/10
Music -2/10
Food quantity is less compared to other places . If you are going after 8:00PM there are chances that food will be served cold to you.
Not suitable for couples or a group of ladies . Only a place for boys to hangout.
The only best part about this is that you have a dedicated smoking room."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§∑‡•á‡§ï ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞,09 February 2019,5,"it's good. I suggest this to everyone. Place is good, ambiance is OK. We danced for few hours. It's a chilling environment and foods are available at affordable prices"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mimi,07 February 2019,3,The foods are awesome. Place is very noisy. Even if you cannot here the other person's voice sitting opposite to you. Dance floor is not at all classy.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Anudeep Adiraju,06 February 2019,1,"The food's really below average. Although they've put a lot of items on their menu, all of them lack quality and flavour. The service is not at all good. Nobody's even around you to take your orders or your feedbacks. If you are planning to go to this place for food, it's really a horrible idea.üëéüëéüëé"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Suraj Shenoy,03 February 2019,4,Had a delivery ordered from here. Makki roti and sarsong ka saag was okay. Saag tasted more like palak. But packing and delivery was good. Price is on higher side.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Venkat,26 January 2019,4,"The Maintenance Was Good With Separate Smoking Area, The Dance Floor Was Nice with Lighting and The Food Will be Supplied to Us Quickly, Its My First Time Going to a Pub and I had a Lot Of Fun"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mounika Atta,23 January 2019,4,Have been to La La Land. Their food was so good and the ambiance was also good. This is an better alternative to 3b's. Must try place with cool setup.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sainikelash Jammula,19 January 2019,5,"This Place is Picture Perfect for the People who have immense love to Hang Around at the Bar Counters!
This place has a beautiful Bar Counter.
Dance Floor is too hot and lovely. Ambiance is too good and warm. Food is tasty. Serving is very warm."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Rohit Gupta,18 January 2019,1,"We went today for an office team lunch. We were around 25 in number and had made prior reservation. Reached there at sharp 12:30 .We had to ask the manager to get all the seats as he allotted seats to some other customers despite of our reservations. The first started was served 1/2 hr after we were all seated. One plate of starter served by one person to 25 people. I had to ask the manager to add few more people to serve but he refused. 
After the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins. 
My colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served, and this was his answer.
""Abhi aap ne kya khaya ??.. Panner khaya na.... woh veg hi hota"".
We were shocked to see such a response and rude behavior from him.
The staff serving the food were courteous, but this guy who I think was the manager was extremely rude. I finally had to getup and make him realize of his behavior.  
Starters and food was ok for the price."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Anusha Sinha,13 January 2019,3,"Food was great . The ambience was okay.
Crowd not so good.
Music was good.
But there was not much crowd to dance.
Had fun time with friends.
Ordered honey chilly potato. Chicken lollipop, paneer lababdar, butter naan."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Asha Bishnoi,12 January 2019,4,La la land is best place for those who love dance and music.Went to this place to celebrate one of my friends bachelorette amd we enjoyed a lot.Staff amd service were goodü§òüèª
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Prachi,12 January 2019,1,"This used to be a good place, the service level now is pathetic. They won‚Äôt even offer you the menu unless you ask for it, if a dish is served in a bad state it will take ages for you to give the feedback and by the time it is changed your meal would be over and the check ofcourse will take atleast 15 mins to get to you...so plan wisely at Lol Lol land"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vamshi Prakash Kondapalli,10 January 2019,3,"Went out for a team dinner sizing 30. Had non-veg starters and Biryani. Limited desserts options. Food was OK Ok 3/5. Waiters have no empathy for customers - very rude/late/unprofessional in serving 2/5. Music was too loud, very hard to converse with the team. 3/5. Ambience is good but looked pretty aged."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Jithin Meruga,09 January 2019,3,"The ambience was really great.The starters and desserts were top notch.But when it comes to main course,it's downfall.Could do better for main course."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Pooja Thakkar,07 January 2019,1,"We went here for 31st 2018 Evening after reserving table for 3. They told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything. So it was 1500 for us 3 and food & drinks charges being seperate. We saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine.
When we went there, for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500. Cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee.
We always keep cards mostly, luckily we had that much cash, paid and went inside.
Got a table for 4 for us 3.
So like first mistake of staff when ordered a Mojito- Mocktail as I dont drink, and they instead of Mocktail send a Cocktail - Alcoholic Drink.
Second mistake of staff, as we are purely vegetarians- in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter. And they came and served Non Veg starter.
After complaining about this both to staff, they apologised and said it won't repeat.
Now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again, AGAIN for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a Non Veg Starter again to us.
I complained to Manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do LEAST.
Not that I asked for any but that was courtesy on their side.
So when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it.
Ok and the last thing, the DJ mostly 70% of time was playing VERY OLD SONGS which I again didn't enjoy.
Oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st December 2018 with increased prices."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sweta Choudhury,04 January 2019,3,"Food is decent and the menu is also good, we want for team lunch. They serve starters on table rest is a spread. Service is so so, not that great. The place the food spread is kept is very congested, should be an open area."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Suresh,04 January 2019,2,"We went for lunch buffet. Food taste is average and limited options. Service is really bad. None of them show up when we are asking for food, water etc. But we got the bill on our table while we are still having deserts."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Jagannadh Chowdary,03 January 2019,4,"Ambience was superb .. food was good .. table booking is highly recommended on both weekdays & weekends.. I Visited with family felt very comfortable although it's a bar+kitchen. so, it's not the prefect place to hangout with gang but surely can have a try once .. initially we planned for ala carte , but went for buffet because ala carte seems expensive compared to other restaurants.. Peaceful experience no distractions what so ever..
prefer to have spicy food it's the best place to visit .. starters were amazing Fish was superb (Spicy) .

I booked a table 1day prior to my visit but still had to wait 45min for table after i entered the restaurant.. only this was my negative feedback on my visit.

7.5/10

Thanks!"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Yash Barmecha,03 January 2019,4,It is a good place to go. The ambience can be better. The food is above average and the service is fast. It can be better by improving the ambience.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Raghu Dahagam,01 January 2019,3,"La La Land!

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!
Overall the food was good but can be improved.

Service- 4/5
Very attentive staff who handled 15 people in a very decent and cordial way.

Overall do visit this place for with friends/ colleagues and enjoy the drinks and music!"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Maneendar,01 January 2019,1,The worse service. Food is worst and can't able to eat deserts. They can't even take care of customer. The fish starter was even very less items and less spacious.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Neha Gupta,09 December 2018,4,"Visited this place with friend. The administration is good. You've got two different seating setups. One is with the sofas and another is with the benches.
Ambience is nice and apt for night life.
Food tasted good and texture, presentation is decent.good open area for dance floor..Recommend for light evenings.."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Karthikreddy,09 December 2018,5,"Great place to hangout , ambiance are great and food tastes good . More over it‚Äôs the best place for a group of 4 to chill and enjoy nightlife"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Biswadeep Mishra,08 December 2018,3,"Seats and Tables in the center area are crooked. Couches are comfortable but only for big groups. Food/Drinks at par with any other place in the area, nothing special there. Lights are almost perfectly dim. Environment/Ambiance is really nice. They have Ladies, Karaoke, DJ nights too. Service could be a lot better, as in they put the food on the table and leave you be.

Hard to miss the place as its just beside Gachibowli flyover. Enough parking space. The place remains kinda empty on weekdays.

Service 2.5/5
Price 3/5
Ambiance 3.5/5"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sudip Nandy,03 December 2018,4,"The place was awesome, we went for team lunch last week. Ambience was good, food were awesome and tasty.

Thanks La La Land, we will try again to visit..."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Manidhar_pjr,01 December 2018,3,"La La land...... A place with great ambience.......

Ambience: üåüüåüüåüüåü
One of the best places with great ambience in the city. The place is dim lighted but not too dark. It's the perfect place to hang out in the evening for a drink.

Food: üåüüåüüåü
The place will serve you with a good buffet. A series of starters and main courses and desserts are just awesome here. Just make sure you are not late as the buffet strictly closes at 3:00 pm.

Hospitality: üåüüåüüåüüåü

The staff is well trained to manage the crowd and at making you feel good."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mohit Anand,01 December 2018,3,"We went to this place yesterday night for a colleague's farewell party.
This is situated adjacent to Over the moon hotel in Gachibowli.

We availed Zomato gold and got 2+2 drinks offer.

The staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour, there were a couple of instances when they didn't understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour.

In starters, Paneer Tikka, Chilli corn salt and pepper and Egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them.
In main course, we ordered Dal makhani and Paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations.

Nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering Gulab jamun.
I must say, it was one of the best gulab jamun's I have had until now.

Wanted to give them 3.5 rating but deducting 0.5 for staff behaviour."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Payel Biswas,01 December 2018,4,"This place is a play of light and shadow... Beautifully organized and carefully decorated with cushions and low height sitting areas.
We had lunch buffet and it was really nice.
Welcome: 1 good-looking and thirst-releiving welcome drink with veg or non-veg soup.
Starters: 3 veg dishes - veg tikki, babycorn and hariyali paneer tikka. 3 non-veg dishes - fish plates, chicken wings and chicken kebabs.
Main Course: It had wide spread of 5-6 types of salads, 2 types of papad, Veg biriyani, Bisimille bhaat, Bhindi fry, Mix veg, Paneer butter masala, Veg Manchurian, Veg noodles, Curd rice, Chicken Fried rice, Chicken biriyani, mutton handi, chicken shakahari and fish gravy.
Desserts: It had gulab jamun, rasmalai, firni, 4-5 types of sweets, 3 types of pastries, ice cream and whole lot of fruits.

The experience was really nice and each and every dish came with awesome deliciousness."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Bini,30 November 2018,5,"We went on Friday night for Corporate Team Dinner .. Eventually we made a right choice to go to this place ..
The place has 2 sections where there is nice comfy sofa arrangements with dim lights {ideal place to date üòâ} ..and other end has normal arrangements facing DJ and Dance floor .
Down to Food
The Chinese Non veg starters was cooked brilliantly . The best items to have Dragon chicken and crispy chilly wings ..
Even Alcoholic drinks were pretty cheap ...standout drink was ‚ÄúLong Island Iced Tea ‚Äú...Surprisingly they had Bira too .

Waiters reacted quickly to us although it was pretty jam packed ..

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Kushal Gummadi,30 November 2018,4,"Went for lunch and Opted for buffet. Dark and nice ambience you will like it as soon as you enter.
Notably Paneer tikka and chicken wings were very good. Staff could be a bit more responsive and we waited around 10 min just to pay the bill and didn't accept payment through nearby.com app reasoning a lame reason that we don't know.
Rest all was good.
Note: Location in Zomato is not accurate, please google it."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Arpit Kumar Jain,29 November 2018,2,"They don't seem to use good quality ingredients for the food they serve.
Went for vegetarian buffet.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Chandu Reddy,16 November 2018,1,"Very bad customer service booked a table for 6 before and when reached there, they are arraging 4 people table really worse seating.........."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Prajyot,14 November 2018,3,"Average food quality... Went there for team. Lunch.

They should increase the number of starters in their Buffet Menu. The Pastries and Brownies in the dessert section were Hard.

The main course was good the Paneer Butter Masala was very good in taste also their Veg Pulao is worth trying.

Overall good place to give a try."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Paresh Patel,14 November 2018,1,Just now had a buffet lunch and right now in restaurant only and writing this review. Not much option for vegetarians. Service is pathetic as we have to ask for starters and they are not serving and waited for 10 mins and had main course. After that they served remaining starter. Dessert were not at all good in quality.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sreejith Sreekumaran,14 November 2018,5,An amazing place with great ambience and lovely music. We went for their lavish lunch buffet and it was a great experience. Malai tikka and chicken wings we're amazing and so was dhana chicken. They served one of the best Phirnis I have tasted. A great place to hangout
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Dbs Gyale,09 November 2018,5,Be polite and friendly staff food is very good and dj dance floor is very nice me and my friends very happy so noce place the best pub in the hyderabad city wow........ Thanks all staff
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Surya Teja Alimineti,06 November 2018,2,"Though the ambience and food was good, especially been here to make some moves on the dance floor. When we‚Äôve gotten over the floor, bouncer refrained us from dancing on the floor and asked us to move away which was utterly disappointing."
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Sameer,05 November 2018,5,"Ambience- Very relaxing seething and decoration are good ,

Went with friends for buffet.
We have been welcome very gracefully .

The restaurant wasn't crowd. We got comfortable seating

Soup and snack has been served on the table. For main course we have helped ourself.

Service was very good and impressiveüëçüëè

Now coming to food all the dishes are awesome, Good taste and rich quality

Total value for money.. Recommended"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mihir Nawathe,05 November 2018,4,Went here with friends expecting this to have some cool jazz music because of it's name(lmao) but it was still a nice experience. Everybody enjoyed their drinks and the food was good. The dacefloor isn't half bad either if there aren't too many people dancing.
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vineet Nanda,03 November 2018,3,"This restaurant has its priorities straight. Unlike AB's, Flechazo, and Barbeque Nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste.

Which means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.

Instead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. Very professional, indeed.

The starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. This place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. Kebabs are to die for.

Having said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. They have tried a lot of things, from Mughlai, Intercontinental, to Chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.

But what actually took my heart away, what this joint EXCELS in, hands-down, compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department. For someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.

The variety and taste will haunt you for days. The desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.

I was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a RockaRolla discovery. Definitely worth one visit, and then the count will just keep on ticking!"
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Mallika Bhupathiraju,03 November 2018,4,This place opened last year and is a small place but is very happening . The evening I went there was an office party going on and there was a buffet catered for them. This place has a small dance floor and nice interiors. They have a huge variety in their food and alcohol menu and they taste amazing. They even have a lunch buffet menu at a reasonable price! Do visit this place if you are in Gachibowli!
Owm Nom Nom,Sravani,22 May 2019,3,Veg biryani they serve here is too good and loved it....located very well nearby to IT sector DLF gate 3. Can be more better and improvements can be made as demand is high in this area
Owm Nom Nom,Nagendra Reddy Nallamilli,20 May 2019,1,"Very bad biryani. Ordered fry Biryani but they brought Dum Biryani. Instead of changing they mixed and made food so much worse.

Don't encourage such restaurants where customers are not treated well and food is as bad as it gets"
Owm Nom Nom,Santosh,19 May 2019,1,"Worst experience ever. Food was spoiled and the same was informed to the staff but not even got a response from them. Atleast they should have some concern on the customers. Even after informing about the taste, they just handed over the bill without even checking my issue. This type of service won't earn anything. This will be my last visit to this restaurant."
Owm Nom Nom,Soham Sthitaprajna,11 May 2019,1,Extremely rude staff and costing like anything if u see there place and food ur going to feel like why the hell you are here.food quality 0/5
Owm Nom Nom,Preetham Kumar Myadam,03 May 2019,1,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.....!!

The worst ever experience which I have ever faced.....
Zero taste, zero service, NO ac nor fan, the staff has no basic respect nor they are worried about the customer.

The food served was rotten & no proper hygiene was maintained.

The Restaurant manager Mr. Anwar was rude towards customers don't know why they are running this hotel.

Completely ZERO."
Owm Nom Nom,Hemanth Reddy P,01 May 2019,1,"If you want to have gud food...Then DONT order in this restaurant...they will prepare late...Zomoto asusally worst delivery service...No one lift your phone call at restaurant...

Owm Nom Nom,Sourav Mishra,19 April 2019,5,"Best quality food with rich spicy taste in reasonable price, biryani lovers you can try for special chicken price , the staffs and manager is very coperative."
Owm Nom Nom,Varshasharma17971,19 April 2019,5,"If you love spicy food enrich with taste and good quality then this is the bestest place to have your food , must must try is afgaani chicken and fry biryani ‚ù§Ô∏è and and kaju paneer as well ‚úåüèª"
Owm Nom Nom,Sumeet Bhasin,17 April 2019,1,"We had a worst experience, waste of money no courtesy, pathetic quality of food. They serve cuddle milk soup instead of cream of mushroom. Server argue and justify you place wrong order. Old fish, cheap oil they use. We paid our bill and had to left food without eating. Never to visit this place again"
Owm Nom Nom,Sujana Velicheti,11 April 2019,1,"Today I have received worst biryani, getting some smell, previously I have ordered so many times then it was good, today I don't know what happened"
Owm Nom Nom,Narendra,11 April 2019,1,Food is not good it's below average and too costly ... Moreover their behavior is not polite..... Restaurant is not hygiene as well ... The smell is bad ‚òπÔ∏è . When you are into food business have some respect for customers
Owm Nom Nom,·¥Ä…¥.·¥è·¥õ ú·¥á Ä.s·¥á…¥,31 March 2019,2,"The waiters are super slow, the cutlery used in the restaurant are not even clean. Hygiene is a big issue here. Coming to the food, it's nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food. But again, the usage of oil is much more. Biryani and tandoori are the safest options here. Keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right. Check it before paying. I found a dish added in the bill which I did not order. When pointed out, the waiter seemed to be confused.

This place, if it has a target of surviving,needs to improve a lot in terms of food taste, consistency, service and most importantly, hygiene."
Owm Nom Nom,SEEMA MEHTA,30 March 2019,1,"I have been there 2to 3 times but this time i had the worst experience. Waiter was in some othe worls we asked him to bring something and he ordered something..
At the time of serving food the waiter told us paneer is there but paneer tikka is not available and the hilarious part was we did not order paneer tikka, so what we ordered in veg in that also it did not had paneer. At the time of billing they create a lot of chaos...
So I had the worst experience."
Owm Nom Nom,Jayasurya Varma,11 March 2019,3,"Very good place but we need to wait so long for the food to deliver us they serve the customers very good response,we had murgh malai kabab and muuton briyani with our office colleagues very good in taste I like the grren chutney which they serve with malai kabab ü§©üòõ"
Owm Nom Nom,Right Fooodies,05 March 2019,1,"Place located just opposite of DLF gate no 3, which is very much easy to reach. Just reached this place to explore some of their expertise dishes and found lost !
Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!
All the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part."
Owm Nom Nom,Prane ETh,02 March 2019,5,"Ordered tandoori chicken from here. Trust me, never expected this kind of taste from this place. Taste was really awsome compared to other tandoori places in gachibowli. Definitely will go for it again."
Owm Nom Nom,Sushma Thodety,16 February 2019,1,"Ordered chicken lollipop as a starter..but received them as burnt,salty and wet instead of dry snack. Egg fried rice was ok. Chicken kadai curry was not tasty at all .Chicken seems to be old stock. Veg rolls looked like Dosa roll instead. Rolls should be crispy with stuff not coming out. Didn't like the food at all . I'm not gonna order it from here again. Price also on the higher side but food is not worth the price."
Owm Nom Nom,Venkata Sai,10 February 2019,1,The service is not good. The plates are not cleanly washed. They are not serving properly. Look at the picture how worst the spoon and bowl.
Owm Nom Nom,Chandan Mashetty,07 February 2019,3,Tried two dishes .. chicken biryani and mushroom biryani both tasted good initially but as the ghee content was more the taste was not very good ..
Owm Nom Nom,Aavishkar Jain,03 February 2019,1,"Ordered a lime soda with biryani. Recieved lime soda in used kinley soda bottle opened, half filled. This is ignoring basic hygine and acceptable packaging. The restaurant is risking people health. Not sure what else they will be compromising on."
Owm Nom Nom,Raghu Alluri,28 January 2019,1,Painfully Slow delivery. Exceedingly Oily and bland. Definitely not recommending it. They gave us all kinds of odd and inconsistent reasons for the delay so not satisfied by the whole experience. Sorry.

Extremely oily...never seen anything like that. Just wrapped it in tissues and yet over flowing oil, squeezed into the sink honestly. Couldn't eat it obviously because of the smell and oil."

Owm Nom Nom,Siva Kumar,09 September 2018,3,"This place would have got more if the staff and the service improved their behavior..

Have been this place to several times, just because of the taste of the food, and with the hope that staff behavior would improve, but always I come back dissapointed..

Food-4/5 Main course at this place is very good. Biryani is not out of this world but tastes good.

Ambience- (3.5/4)
The restaurant as a whole has gone renovation and it's upgraded to become ""ok"" type ambience

Service-2/5
Very slow, staff are super rude and they don't give a damn about anything.

It's a good place to order to home as you need not bear with these mannerless uncultured staff."

The second time I visited the place, the guy spilled the lime soda on me and the plate. I couldn‚Äôt even have my starters ya. He didn‚Äôt even serve them again which he was supposed to. The worst part was the attitude."
Ulavacharu,Nss Rohit,22 May 2019,1,The food was not up to the mark. I just couldn't eat a bit. The so called special 'Raju gari Pulao' was just a nightmare. Don't recommend to anyone
Ulavacharu,Vachnala Viswanath,22 May 2019,4,"Ambience- 5/5
Food - being a vegetarian couldn‚Äôt find a lot of options, but the food is tasty except for some dishes which completely ruin the day 4/5"
Ulavacharu,Sravani,22 May 2019,3,Nice ambiance. We had guthivankaya pulao and it‚Äôs like kind of ok not so great . Pocket friendly .They have different items in menu but taste wise can be little more better
Ulavacharu,Aditya,15 May 2019,1,"Too much expensive for the quantity served. Not worth the money. Most items in the menu aren't available.

Taste is just average. Not recommended"
Ulavacharu,Uday Uddanti,11 May 2019,4,One of the best place to serve Andhra delicacies in Hyderabad. I love the pulaos here. Their speciality dishes are definitely a treat. Little expensive I must say. Overall good place.
Ulavacharu,Nagula Nagaraju,11 May 2019,5,"One of the best food experience in Hyderabad
Raju gari kodi pulav- Unique and Mouth wateringüòã
Quantity is very less compared to other similar level of restaurants"
Ulavacharu,Tyrion Lannister,10 May 2019,5,"Went for lunch to this place on Friday. It was full crowded and we waited for almost 1hr. If you want to go this place first reserve the table.
Coming to the taste, it was awesome. We had Raju gari kodi palav, ulavacharu biryani and chicken vepudu. All were really good and serving also very fast."
Ulavacharu,Vijay Kumar Konkati,08 May 2019,1,"The food was good as usual, but the service is become worse. The waiters are ignorant and lame, not attending tables , even for the menu we had to Menu multiple times. Not attending the table even after calling them multiple times. It was not even a busy business time.

Request the management to have them trained, it just th food which is bringing us here"
Ulavacharu,Sukumar Kondaparthy,08 May 2019,1,"Ordered Gadwal Kodi Pulav, it had no salt. No resolution on it even after complaining that it had no salt. The quantities served are very less, so everyone who think one Pulav will serve two, to need to order one for each."
Ulavacharu,Mili Biswas,05 May 2019,5,"Me and my friend went for authentic South Indian pulao, and boy, the dishes are really tasty! We had kodi pulao and it was super tasty.. Definitely going to go again.."
Ulavacharu,Chandrasekhar,04 May 2019,1,"This place is worse, you will see flies and Don‚Äôt have courtesy to the customers.
Zomato accept the booking and restaurant will not accept"
Ulavacharu,Abhishek Vanny,04 May 2019,1,"Reservation confirmed for 11pm, (shows open till 11:30pm), denied dining on arrival without prior intimation saying kitchen closed by 10:30 Pm and that they are not on zomato."
Ulavacharu,Ankita,04 May 2019,4,"Undoubtedly pocket friendly place.
We had chicken sambar rice. And leaf- wrapped roasted chicken. We also had curd cutlet which was super yummy!!!"
Ulavacharu,Sri Harsha Konuru,03 May 2019,4,"If u are a non vegetarian and if you r craving for some good authentic Telugu food...This is the place to be....Their Raju garu pulao is one of its kind...Guntur billal Mutton biryani...Kodi chips, and Gadwal pulao....These were the dishes we had and trust me they wer just exceptional...highly recommend this place.."
Ulavacharu,Anil Seth,08 April 2019,3,"Nice and friendly place to be in the ambiance is great and nature colour has been use to make the place nice and appointed
I could the service to be very good and friendly
We ordered for bamboo chicken and chicken pulav both the dishes were nicely presented
Spice content was high has always in Hydrabad cuisine bamboo chicken was well done with nice aroma and taste
Pulav was served in nice quantities sufficient for more the one person chicken tender and rice perfect
Seems will need to pay more visits to try other combinations
As a compliment a very nice Mysore paak was offered great taste !!
Will visit again"
Ulavacharu,Rohit Rao,31 March 2019,5,"WOW Ulavacharu. I NEVER ever knew your biryanis are so freakin awesome.

So I happened to go here by chance as my friend suggested we should just try this place. And my god. Me being eggatarian, obvious i ordered for an Egg Biryani. What presentation and what taste. Usually you just get the egg booked on top of the rice, but here, they cut it and the spice is inside of the cut Egg. How cool and tasty. I did have some before like this but this, this taste. Yummmmm. Kudos!

However they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day I went there. That wasn't all that good. Way to sweet. Uhh. And my friend is a Non-vegetarian, he had some chicken Biryani and sure he licked his fingers. Awesome Ulavacharu. I'm coming back soon. Thank-you."
Ulavacharu,Aparna Isaac,29 March 2019,1,Worst service. Food quantity is very less. Even the AC temperature was high. I suggest not to visit this place. Ridiculous thing was thums up and water was served hot.
Ulavacharu,Polimati Naveen Prasad,29 March 2019,5,"I got to know about this place from a TV show so went to try some biriyani. Ordered kotha chicken and Bamboo chicken which is a must try
Ambience:4
Food taste:4.2
Staff:4"
Ulavacharu,Anoop Gopal,25 March 2019,3,Rustic ambience was good. The prawn and crispy veg starters were very average. The Andra style curry was good. Complimentary laddoo tasted yummy. Overall decent place but nothing amazing as far as the food is concerned.
Ulavacharu,4mybanti,21 March 2019,2,Too expensive and is served with very less quantity. Went with family and it was disappointing as many of menu items weren‚Äôt available and Poor service. Not so great and it can be skipped.
Ulavacharu,Karan Deep Geddam,20 March 2019,4,Been here with parents. Ordered hot and sour soup and pachi mirchi pulav. The soup was a bit spicy but tasty. The pulav was to the point neither spicy nor bland.
Ulavacharu,Surya Teja Alimineti,17 March 2019,2,"Though this food chain has got some fame, I totally disagree with it for the experience we had on our Friday lunch. Poor response and tardy service. Management failed to take care of the waiters who were very few around the tables. Waiters has to be augmented along with swiftly handling the services."
Ulavacharu,Kunal Anand,09 March 2019,5,"Heaven for people who love Spicy Food!
Head here if you have spicy non-veg craving. Order the fried chicken and biryani, and oh God, just wait for the spice gods to come and sit next to you to bless you.

Ulavacharu FTW."
Ulavacharu,Geethanand Veerla,08 March 2019,1,The worst experience ever. Ordered achari ghoshti it came with more salt later asked him he repaired the remaining curry after half an hour. Also the service was too slow and pathetic.
Ulavacharu,G.goutham,07 March 2019,5,"This is one of a place where you won‚Äôt be disappointed, everything is good right from starters to main course to deserts. Nice service by Sri and team."
Ulavacharu,Darshana Krishnadas,06 March 2019,5,"A lot of people suggested this place for some real spicy food. Had been there twice and in fact the first time I went there I knew that whenever I have guests at home I need to bring them here. Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.
Coming the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.
So it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .
Definitely recommended."
Ulavacharu,Nir,04 March 2019,3,"This place gives a strong Telugu vibe. Taste of the food is little spicey. I ordered Bengali Kodi and bamboo chicken in starter. It was good and in main course took ulavacharu special fried rice which is little spicey. In dessert ordered kulfi which is very less amount as compared to price.

Good thing about the resturant is it has a decent ambience.Service was generous."
Ulavacharu,Nannapaneni Kiran,02 March 2019,5,"Great decor, however it doesn't match with the name. Wonderful atmosphere, ulavachru biryani was exceptional and starters as well. Excellent service and a nice place to enjoy food with family."
Ulavacharu,Rahul Sai,01 March 2019,3,"Food and ambiance are great here, but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity. Service was too slow and can't able to manage things.

We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao, chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao, names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste.  

Overall review: Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao."
Ulavacharu,Calming Storm,24 February 2019,3,"The name of this food place and the ambiance is amazing. Food is expensive here, meaning high cost and less quantity. The taste is good. It is advice to them to train their servers to get knowledge of all the items on the menu."
Ulavacharu,Neha Rathi,21 February 2019,5,Awesome place.. very good ambiance... Good variety in food.. polite & helpful staff ... music also gives andra feel.. best veg pulav in Hyderabad!!
Ulavacharu,Teja Dandigunta,19 February 2019,4,"One of the most recommended places to enjoy authentic andhra cuisine. Been here multiple times and tried many dishes, they never let us down. As soon as we enter, we were offered with complimentary sweet - jalebi. (Sometimes they forget, in so, you can ask for it)
Among starters, bamboo chicken and bangla kodi are my favorites.
Bamboo chicken is very tender and it gets cooked inside a hollow bamboo stick and its sizzling hot with yummy taste.
Bangla kodi is very unique with each chicken piece wrapped in a sliced potato, this is a must try.
They have got a wide range of main course to cater to everyone's need, I have tried prawns vepudu pulav, this is the dish to go for if you like prawns, spicy, yummy, tasty, fulfilling and satiating.
Pachi mirchi kodi pulav and Gadwal kodi pulav are great too. Raju gari kodi pulav is their signature dish, but it will be soggy so not everybody may like it.
Don't forget to cool off your taste buds with rose milk or junnu in the end
Ambiance is soothing and sets the right atmosphere for a great meal. Service is bit slow and could be improved.
No issues with parking, they've got valet."
Ulavacharu,Ganesh Kumar,18 February 2019,1,"Ordered Nellore Chapala Pulusu and Andhra Kodi Kura. Both are Worst Awful Tasteless Pathetic.
Dont waste your money and time  complete useless stuff."
Ulavacharu,Srikar Venuthurupalli,18 February 2019,3,The ambience is good. But the food took too long time to arrive at the table. We ordered some 3 kinds of pulav items but had to cancel them due to delay
Ulavacharu,Siddhardh Stunning,15 February 2019,1,Ulavacharu is well known for its taste. But the service I received today was the worst and this is not the first time even after complaining to the manager about it he did not even apologize for it and moreover he delivered me mutton instead of chicken and when asked about it he was like this is chicken and he tried blaming me instead . The way they behaved was worst . Manager named veera babu was very rude too. He was not even responding whatever we ask he said I am the sole owner and no one is above me. Even after we paid the bill they behaved rude. I do not recommend going here..
Ulavacharu,Shail Choudhary,15 February 2019,4,"Went here for dinner with my big time foodie friend Surya Tej Kanuri, he only recommended the place and I liked it. As we entered, they served complementary badusha, and it was good. Both of us being non-vegetarian we ordered fish, bamboo chicken, mutton biryani, and some regional dessert which I am not aware of (also they have limited number of desserts, and some of them were not available). With bill they do serve paan."
Ulavacharu,Subarna Banerjee,13 February 2019,5,"Ulavacharu is one of the best south indian cuisine here I have tried in Hyderabad city.. Being a north indian (oppps, West Bengal is not considered as a northern state, so being an East Indian) my first step for an authentic Andhra rochulu (am I pronouncing right?) Went pretty good.. The ambience, decoration & presentation were amazing.. Food taste was amazing.. They serve 2 laddoos as complimentary when you sit on the chairs.. overall a good experience!
I exactly forgot the names of those 3 dishes we ordered but Junnu in desert was something different I never tried before.. mildly sugary desert made from fresh cowmilk (custard pie type) was amazing."
Ulavacharu,Avinash Kondapalli,04 February 2019,1,"Very bad experience with this place. Ordered lemon corriender soup with godavari royyala vepudu. soup is good in consistency but high on sourness. Not really good. Royyala vepudu was good but not hot, looks like they prepared an hour ago. After that we ordered gadwal Kodi pulao which is my worst experience ever. It is an highly spiced rice which a normal person can't eat.
Ambience and service is very good but not the food"
Ulavacharu,Varun Barla,04 February 2019,3,The place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe. Nice old songs to go with courteous service. We ordered for Chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup. Sweet corn soup was ok. The pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected. Suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead. Also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani. The veg option was disappointing. Should stick to non veg pulav/biryani and boneless.
Ulavacharu,Srinivas Maddula,30 January 2019,5,"I visited this place first with my friend s and late with office colleagues, Place was very good like ambience, service food quality. Try koramenu it will be very good."
Ulavacharu,Himagiri Rao Kuna,28 January 2019,1,Very very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order online.Very very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order online. Very very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order online
Ulavacharu,Monika Raj,25 January 2019,3,"Food - 4
Ambience - 3
Service - 3

Bamboo Chicken and Raju Gari Kodi pulao is a must try here. Prawns and Chicken Roast is okay. Service is little slow and messy. Ambience can be improved a little. Good place to try the authentic Andhra dishes."
Ulavacharu,MANAS AGRAWAL,25 January 2019,1,"The place doesn't serve your booking request. You have to still wait an hour to get the table even after doing a booking, it just completely spoils the mood ."
Ulavacharu,Shlok Ramchandran,19 January 2019,4,"Wanted to have some good authentic Andhra food and Ulavacharu didn‚Äôt disappoint me , loved the food even though it was a bit spicy . The Masam Vedupu Pulao and the Masam Miriyala are a must try here , The Andhra Kodi Kura didn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations though . Ended the meal with the Rajahmundry Rose Milk which also ticked the box .Service was fantastic throughout.Overall enjoyed my experience here and would recommend this place to people looking for spicy authentic Andhra food . Cheers !
P.S- Extra points for the motichur ladoo they gave us as a welcome snack ."
Ulavacharu,DP Singh,18 January 2019,4,Authentic South Indian flavours. I loved the biryani. This is for the first time I tried some Biryani truely n completely different from other restaurants in Hyderabad.
Ulavacharu,Vasanth Kalyan,18 January 2019,2,"Food isn't great for the price. Ulavacharu Veg Pulao or Ulavacharu by itself wasn't to the taste.
Not a great place for Vegetarians. Heard good about Non Veg options."
Ulavacharu,Nillu,16 January 2019,4,I visited 3 month ago it was good but it was very spicy .. ans somewhat costly also interior is good as well behavior of stap members.........
Ulavacharu,Shubham Shinde,13 January 2019,5,"I got to visit this place through a giveaway by @hyderabadfooddiaries and it was worth a visit. We tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. Mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.
This pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry. This place has huge variety of appetizers, curries and rice in chicken, mutton,seafood and veg options.
Best destination for spice loversüëç

Ulavacharu,Epicure,13 January 2019,5,The taste n quality of the food is awesome but its pricy. ambience is ok and crowded.Service was good. You would definitely not regret for the price you paid.
Ulavacharu,Ravi Nandan,09 January 2019,3,"Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered ""Bamboo chicken"" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge.

As part of main course we ordered ""Rayala vari kodi pulao"" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped ""Raju gari kodi pulao"", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (INR 435) is high for the quantity we get."
Ulavacharu,Srinivas,04 January 2019,2,"It's worst place to dine

Too much hyped!!!!!!!!!

Last Sunday we visit this with my friends.. I tried here bamboo Chicken n pachi Mirchi kodi pulav both not at all up to the Mark"
Ulavacharu,Akhil Shamanth,01 January 2019,1,"Was there for new years eve, the ambiance is great and so was the staff but it was overpriced by almost 50% and Mutton wasn't cooked well.

Fish vepudu though was finger licking good.

Would have been 3 stars but reduced two because of pricing and poor Mutton dish."
Ulavacharu,Urmila Pawar,01 January 2019,2,"We went on the new year day. Menu was limited. We waited 1 hour almost to get our food on the table. Service was horrible due to rush. Food was not that tasty. We ordered rajugari natu kodi pulao, which was bland. We ordered kothmira kodi kura as curry with roti. It was just OK but less spicy. We ordered junnu for desert which was the only good thing amongst all the dishes bit the quantity was so less for the price. Overall it's too much hyped restaurant with ordinary tatsing food at expensive rate. My suggestion better look for other options. Don't go during festive seasons it's crazy crowded."
Ulavacharu,Raghu Ram K,01 January 2019,3,Ambience was good..went on a busy afternoon..ordered mamsam roast..was okayish..then ordered ulavacharu chicken pulao and pachi mirchi royyala pulao..ulavacharu chicken was good..royyala pulao was nothing special..service can definitely improve..
Ulavacharu,Prashanth M,31 December 2018,4,"Have been to this place couple of times... Though it is expensive, you will have a chance to taste few amazing starters like bamboo chicken, Kotha Kodi and variety of pulaos... The food here has authentic Andhra taste.."
Ulavacharu,Sushmitha Verma,31 December 2018,1,"This is such a over rated stupid place. I really dont know why is this even liked by people.
Food was very bad, service too.
Menu is an ocean and taste is nill.
I dont think they will survive over time, quality has come down soo bad."
Ulavacharu,Kameswararao Dv,30 December 2018,2,After hearing from my friends suggestions. I had prawns fry and chicken biryani... They need to improve food taste and quality... my dinner at ulavacharu. Food is okay
Ulavacharu,Vamsi ¬Æ,30 December 2018,3,"Too much hyped....!!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant, but finally it ended up with a disappointment, mainly the pulav's.
Initially we were offered complementary sweets.Tried Pachi Mirchi Kodi pulav,Oorugallu Veg Pulav,Kotha Kodi & Crunchy curd cutlet.

Pachi Mirchi Pulav - was nice but lacked the expected spiciness,though its a medium varient.
Oorugallu Veg Pupav- Mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic, tasted like baby onions coocked with mango pickle.Quite a different experience, never had one like this before.
Kotha Kodi- Just an edited version of Chicken Majestic.
Crunchy curd cutlet - Good but too oily.

Finally ended the meal with a dessert(Junnu), which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant.

Good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good number.Service was generous but a bit slow.

Overall food taste was just ok, lacked the heat.Can be improved a lot..."
Ulavacharu,Sowmya,30 December 2018,5,If you want something really spicy.. try ULAVACHARU.... Starters are very tasty especially the peanut chicken. And good to listen to old songs..
Ulavacharu,Pradeep Koney,29 December 2018,4,"Great ambience and awesome food served here. Onion Rings, Curd Cutlet, Godavari Royyala Vepudu, Bamboo Chicken are must try starters. Pachi Mirchi Kodi Palau, Raju Gari Kodi Palau and Gadwal Kodi Palau are good options for main course.

P.S. Try their Rajamundry Rosemilk too."
Ulavacharu,Vamsi P,27 December 2018,5,"They tried to create authentic experience right from the ambiance. Food is a real treat, especially for those who like Andhra Cuisine. Bamboo Chicken, Raju gari Kodi pulao, Guthivankaya Pulao, are a must try. The only drawback is the service, which is slow.

Ulavacharu,Rakesh,25 December 2018,3,"Have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews, I can rate the food as very delicious,(specially pachimirchi Kodi Pulao) accurately spicy, varied dishes in the menu but I had a very bad day with respect to service.First of all there were hardly 2 waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those 2 waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests. I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn't be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own."
Ulavacharu,Harish Reddy,24 December 2018,4,This place is simply amazing with authentic Telugu menu and the food presentation. Lovely ambience and equally tasty food . There is a complimentary jalebi and at the end masala pan which is a very nice gesture . Overall a very good experience
Ulavacharu,Deepak Ahuja,21 December 2018,4,"A nice place to taste some of the local delicacies..
I really liked the rusty feel this place has, which takes you back in ages..
Loved the started.. although pulao was not the best I‚Äôve had.
Overall, a nice dine out.."
Ulavacharu,Ashok Surapuraju,16 December 2018,4,"One of the best biryani's I have had in Hyderabad. Ambience is awesome with copper glasses, plates with banana leafs. Service was fast on a Sunday afternoon and the taste was delicious. Ulavacharu veg pulao, Mokkajonna Vepudu filled my appetite. Would definitely visit to try other items."
Ulavacharu,Yamini Chowdary Gudavalli,16 December 2018,4,This is my favorite restaurant always... But i dont know this time the service was very bad.. Taste of food is always awsome here....very disappointed with the staff need to ask everything thrice and more...
Ulavacharu,Santosh Kumar,15 December 2018,3,"Nice place...food was good.. we had sambar rice which was yummy, Guti vankaya pulav was avg...we had Gadwal pulav which was decent and other starters was also pretty decent...but some items which are mentioned in the starter menu(like Mirchi bajji) are always not available...management should be looking in to this...."

Pandu mirapakaya starter is veg starters is superb."
Ulavacharu,Rajesh Krishnan,01 December 2018,4,Went to this place with colleagues for a lunch. Good ambience and good food sums up this place. Bangla Kodi was very unique - chicken pinned with crispy fried potato. We ended up ordering another plate of it. Must try at this place.

Ulavacharu,Megh Lakku,18 November 2018,3,Visited ulavacharu with my son who are both non veg lovers. The food was good but the quantity was very less for the price that was paid. We ordered Raju Gari kodi pulav which costed around 400 and the meat was very less in it.
Ulavacharu,Fit Foodie,18 November 2018,4,"Food - 4
VFM - 3.5
Ambience - 3.5
Service - 3.5

We ordered Bamboo Chicken and Pachi Mirchi Kodi Pulao. Both the dishes had fresh ingredients.
Bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. It is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. It also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any Indian bread.
Pachi Mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. The rice was flavorful. Chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. The chicken was nicely complementing the rice.
Service can be improved a bit. Will go again to this place to try other dishes."
Ulavacharu,Jayaram Boyina,17 November 2018,5,nice service
Ulavacharu,Naga Venkatesh Balijepalli,16 November 2018,1,I ordered Raju Gari kodi palav from this pathetic senseless restaurant. Why the hell there is water in Raju Gari kodi palauo? It is full of water. I have to heat and boil it again to take water out and it became paste. Is this how you serve customers? Pathetic. I am never going to order again from this restaurant. Stupid restaurant
Ulavacharu,Eddie Bari,10 November 2018,4.5,"Amazing food.. Ordered:
Bamboo chicken - Above avg
Chicken Vepudu - Great
Chepala Vepudu - Great
Raju Gari Kodi Pulao - Above avg
Andhra kodi pulusu - Great

Rated 4.5 because of noise or else would have rated it as 5."
Ulavacharu,Pedapati Sravani,09 November 2018,3,"First of all..excellent ambience. Perfect for family gatherings . Coming to food we ordered bamboo chicken , raju gari kodi pulav , korameenu vepudu , kodi vepudu pulav and my favorite junnu which were okay in taste but the starters were delicious."
Ulavacharu,Veeru,05 November 2018,2,"Extremely disappointed with the food taste.we have ordered Kodi roast which was average when compared to godavari royyala vepudu.we usually expect dry item when it is named as vepudu but we got gravy and semi gravy items.same experience with two more items kakathiya mamsam vepudu biryani and Kodi vepudu biryani..
Even the prices are extremely high.if taste is better no one would be bothered about price.üòë"
Ulavacharu,Vishnu Vardhan,03 November 2018,5,"The service was very fast and taste was awesome the ambience was super and raju gari kodi pulao was very tasty,totally everything is awesome."
Ulavacharu,Sandeep Das,03 November 2018,4,"Lovely ambience and equally lovely tasty food . Best part is the valet parking. Good variety of options of authentic food. We had starters, main course and appetisers . There is a complimentary jalebi and at the end masala pan which is a very nice gesture . Overall a very good experience"
Ulavacharu,Akash,01 November 2018,4,Been there with the hype by waiting for 30 mins nearly for the table meanwhile looking at the authentic theme on a Sunday for lunch and management finally provided us a table and we have ordered few items in which ulavacharu biryani is yummy . Service can be better.
Ulavacharu,Nagalakshmi Tenti,31 October 2018,4,delivered late
Ulavacharu,Sriram Ananthula,29 October 2018,1,"Heard so much about this restaurant and went to enjoy the weekend dinner, but the rotis were served cool and the curry is full of oil. Inspite of complaining to concerned staff, there wasn't much difference. Try to avoid Ulavacharu, if you want to have a tasty and healthy food."
Ulavacharu,Srinivas Arepalli,25 October 2018,5,"This is best place compared to all other restaurants of Ulavacharu in Hyd. Service is very quick and obviously tasty food. If you are looking for spicy dish, try Chicken Fried Piece Biryani. You'd love it.This place is highly recommended."
Ulavacharu,Sai Ravali G,18 October 2018,3,"I have been here twice and the food was yummy yummy I say.
Ambiance was kind of historic type with all wooden sculpture kind. It was nice .
We have tried pandumirchisticks which is my fav till date.
Coming to ragi sankati , it has disappointed me a bit. I expected it to be more tasty but it was not bad.
Over all you can enjoy there with yummy food."
Ulavacharu,Katy,14 October 2018,1,The ordered Food was not good spoilt.
Ulavacharu,Srikar Aditya,14 October 2018,5,"Comimg out of a restuarnt with full satisaction after a long long time. Kotha kodivepudu, loose prawns, bamboo chicken, chapala vepudu, natu kodi pulsu, andra kodi kura, ragi sankati evevry thing was perfect except konasema kodi vepudu was a little spicy. Special mention: really quick service."
Ulavacharu,Shaik Munna,12 October 2018,5,Most of my star rating goes to the ambience here.This place is simply amazing with authentic Telugu menu and the food presentation.Prices are on higher side though for the ambience.Spice lovers must visit the place to satisfy their hunger.
Ulavacharu,Sridhar,09 October 2018,4,The experience from the Jubilee Hills outlet led us to try this one with colleagues on a couple of occasions and we were not disappointed. This place lives up to its reputation as a destination of choice for Andhra delicacies. Check it out...
Ulavacharu,Sudheer Kumar D,08 October 2018,1,"No taste in food, starters were served cold, probably it was already cooked so waiter suggested us that dish. It is expensive and not worth at all. they are trying to be over authentic and spoiling the basic taste of food.

Rotis are very hard and Ulavacharu biryani is too much masala and no tasty.

Not suggested to visit."
Ulavacharu,Venkateswarlu Ithadi,07 October 2018,1,"I had a family lunch today at Ulavacharu Gachibowli. Natukodi kaju vepudu was seriously bad in taste, chicken higeneness. When we complain about the same, staff didn't respond in proper manner."
Ulavacharu,Bhanu Prakash,05 October 2018,4,"Good place for team visits , ordered raju gari Kodi pulav and bongulo chicken both tastes great ....ambience is good, place can be extended to have more seats, it is always over crowded .. a must visit place"
Ulavacharu,Food Nawabs,05 October 2018,4,"India is a food nation, every 50 kms you travel from one point to another the taste,spices and the approach changes. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is no different. Andhra the way they cook their dishes is more earthy and less spicy compared to Telangana cuisine. Rayalseema being all healthy as they use Raagi, Spices are very earthy. Why am I preaching this because all these varieties are to be found in Ulavacharu.

Ulavacharu is a vibrant Telugu Brand having branches throughout Hyderbad. Banjarahills, Gachibowli etc....

Their Unique Dishes names, taste especially their crispy chicken skin, although a little tweeek is much needed to the palatte of Hyd. So overall the setup is amazing it just doesn't serve food it gives you an experience. A Must visit place. Points to consider for restaurant their Rose milk is a bad imitation of Rajamundry ,they serve fruitpunch naming it as Rajamundry.. so as I said tweeks are much needed.

4/5 is my rating"
Ulavacharu,Kiran Kumar,02 October 2018,2,The moment you enter the restaurant the ambience is good.We ordered Godavari royalla vepudu that was good.Then we ordered Gadwal kodi pulao was ok their sambar rice was so sour more of citrus taste that was not at all acceptable.
Ulavacharu,Nalin Venkat Sameera,01 October 2018,4,"So, when I went with my parents, I observed the restaurant was jam-packed with people (I swear, it was difficult to get to our seats also). In a way, I couldn't appreciate the ambiance much. We ordered Ulavacharu Vegetable Pulao and what I believe was Pandu Mirapakaya (I hope I'm right). The food was tasty, well-made, with a slightly different mix of spices from the usual. I enjoyed the rice and the flavor it had. Having never tried any rice item of that sort, it felt like a novel burst of flavors to my restless buds. I'd recommend trying the food here at least once."
Shanghai Chef 2,Anupam Acharya,17 May 2019,2,"We went to the first floor confused whether to go to Shanghai Chef or Kobe's, later to realise they are in the same restaurant (i.e they share floor space). We decided to order Chinese. We had the DimSum platter (3/5), Kung Pao Chicken (2/5), Dragon Prawns (2/5) and Fried Ice Cream (4/5). The chicken was hard inside (not indicative of fresh chicken), the prawns were sweet and the DimSums had thick coatings. I did not enjoy my time at Shanghai Chef. So maybe when you're there, just try the Sizzler. Ill update my review when I have it.
Kobe's is a really famous chain for Sizzlers."
Shanghai Chef 2,Abhijeet Mahapatro,14 May 2019,4,"They have a wide range of food offering. Nothing much to talk about ambiance. I visited this place 2 times in a week. 1st time ordered a sizzler which was fantastic.  2nd time we had a chicken stater, soup and a american chopsuey. Soup and starter was good but sea food American Chopsuey was not good. Being a person from coastal area I can tell if sea food is fresh or not, and boy, the prawns were not fresh that is for sure. All and all its a causal dinning if you crave for some variety of Asian food."
Shanghai Chef 2,Rachna K,13 May 2019,1,"Stale food and indigestible noodles. Please don't visit here if you don't want to fall sick. The chicken was dry and uncooked , the noodles was sticky and under cooked. Felt the items were reheated as it was served way quicker than expected."
Shanghai Chef 2,Rahul Talekar,30 April 2019,5,"Shanghai chef 2
Located in the gachibowli ,hyderabad .
Food they are serve is looking good and so tasty.
Price is reasonable.
Staff service is best"
Shanghai Chef 2,Subhendu Khan,24 April 2019,3,"Location wise it is placed in a prime location, centre of IT area, Gachibowli. Food was so delicious, only if you like Chinese flavor, else don't visit. Interior ambience was not so cool, very ordinary. Different kind of soups and dimsums are available at reasonable prices.
Great place to hangout, but if you are planning to visit in weekend then prebooking is recommended."
Shanghai Chef 2,Lavanya Chauhan,23 April 2019,4,"Really loved the food.Tried new Chinese things.Would definitely recommend this.The service was a little slow,but the taste compensated for it.A must visit if you love typical Chinese food."
Shanghai Chef 2,Aishwarya Pati,20 April 2019,1,Extremely poor food quality. I have got my food order replaced everytime I have come here. The service is also not friendly. This is my last visit to this place. I am sorry for the negative reviews.. but this time it was unbearable.
Shanghai Chef 2,Sunil Bathini,19 April 2019,1,"Quantity is very less..... And not so tasty , but service is good. If it provide quantity with tasty food will help the restaurant to attract customers."
Shanghai Chef 2,Anamay Tamrakar (Aman),06 April 2019,3,"Its a casual place for good chinese food. The ambience is a bit dull, but the food is okay. Service is ok. Have been here on multiple occasions and have liked the food they serve."
Shanghai Chef 2,Prabhjot Sandhu,02 April 2019,3,It's a duo restaurant where you can have Chinese and sizzlers together available at one place .... well quantity is much less compared to price and taste is not that good though as Chinese should be at that price...
Shanghai Chef 2,Tyrion Lannister,24 March 2019,4,Shanghai chef and koba sezler both are same restaurents but dont know why in zomato it ia showing as different. You can try this restaurent with friends to taste different chinese varities.
Shanghai Chef 2,Dipro Basu,15 March 2019,3,Small little Chinese joint. Good courteous staff and tasty food. Low on your pocket as well. Located in Gachibowli. Used Zomato gold which was absolutely value for money here
Shanghai Chef 2,Ajay,10 March 2019,1,"I have ordered food online, Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles and Honey Chilly Potato. The taste was pathetic. In chilli garlic noodles, there was no garlic. And Honey potato noodles, they have made French fries and put a sweet syrup on it. Looks like chief does not know how to cook this dish."
Shanghai Chef 2,Kannan Piedy,07 March 2019,4,I've been to Shanghai Chef 2 quite a few times now. Twice before Kobe Sizzlers moved in and once after. It has great staff and a wonderful ambience. It gets busy over the weekend and you might have to reserve a table beforehand. Their sizzlers are wonderful and they have a great set of starters. I would suggest you try them over the main course.
Shanghai Chef 2,Somshankar Naik,01 March 2019,1,"Service was pathetic and staff was absolutely rude and not open for feedback. service is one area where management has to focus on at least as per my experience. Definitely not a place that I will ever visit again with the kind of experience, not that there was any argument or anything it was very cold."
Shanghai Chef 2,Ankit Singla,10 February 2019,4,"liked the food. thanks for suggesting #KhaoPhatkraphao it was good as a full serving

missed the fried ice cream definitely gonna come back for it.

sorry! not to corporate on billing!! üôè

#giveatry"
Shanghai Chef 2,Vandita,01 February 2019,5,"This place is amazing! The food is really tasty, especially the chef recommended. The owner, Suhail, is very courteous and professional. He suggested some great stuff to try and customised the food as per our requirements."
Shanghai Chef 2,Sandeep Ankala,31 January 2019,4,Shanghai Chef has always been the place to go for Chinese fast food. They have a good choice of menu and the food is great. I highly recommend having the crab fried rice and the diced chicken in oriental sauce. America‚Äôs chopsuey is equally tasty.
Shanghai Chef 2,Aanchal Khemka,23 January 2019,4,"This is one go to place for us for authentic Chinese food and it does always stand by my expectation.

We have visited it in past and have always loved the food.

This time we tried some nice salt and pepper vegetable starter which was okish..as I found it to be a little bland..( that's why there is one less star).

We tried Veg Manchow soup which was amazing.

Khao Soi was the main dish we ordered and was again bang on.

Ambiance is pretty much simple yet nice.

Food is amazing. Service is good.

It's definitely worth the money we pay."
Shanghai Chef 2,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),23 January 2019,3,"Ambiance-
Shanghai Chef has one of it's outlet in Gachibowli. Shanghai Chef is Chinese Theme Restaurant specialised in their Chinese dishes. It has indoor sitting available with beautiful lights and music in the background. Sitting arrangement includes couch and chairs.
Food-
We placed an order for Sesame Chilli Chicken as it was mentioned as Must Try starter in the menu. Sesame Chilli contained a large amount of chilli chicken topped with sesame seeds and served with Salad, which tasted somewhat sweet. Sesame Chilli Chicken cost approximately INR 280. We also placed an order for Khao Phad Kruptao in rice item, which included fried rice topped with Spicy gravy contained spinach and capsicum cost approximately INR 290. Shanghai Chef 2 offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very polite."
Shanghai Chef 2,Rajsi Gaikwad,19 January 2019,4,"It's a small place with nice ambience and comfortable sitting. The service was quick and people were friendly. The noodles we ordered were okay, and the veg kung Pao was good. It's a nice place for a casual hangout and Chinese food."
Shanghai Chef 2,Sainikelash Jammula,19 January 2019,5,"Lovely Place to Have Chinese Food. Excellent Service and The Place is very Pleasant to sit with Dear Ones.
Quality of the dishes are too good."
Shanghai Chef 2,Aiswarya Shaji Dev,14 January 2019,4,"Ordered Chicken fried rice and Kung phu chicken. The food was great and value for money. Quantity is less. Good ambience.

Quantity 3/5
Taste 4.5/5
Ambience 4.5/5"
Shanghai Chef 2,Sai Charan,11 January 2019,1,"Restaurant serves stored food. Today I visited to have fried ice cream but it's not fresh. They prepared the food long back and just kept it refrigerated. It's not fresh. When I asked for any manager in the place, there is no Manager available. Worst experience ever. I would not prefer it to anyone."
Shanghai Chef 2,Smita Singh,06 January 2019,2,A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen.
Shanghai Chef 2,Sourav Roy,06 January 2019,4,It is a good restaurant for Chinese food in Gachibowli.we did order food and starters from here and loved the quality and quantity. The staff were all friendly n ambience was decent. Only problem was that their card swipe machine was not working.but overall a good experience in Hyderabad n will visit again to have Chinese food in the landof biriyani.
Shanghai Chef 2,Debasmita Das,29 December 2018,5,A very cosy outlet for some delicious Chinese indulgence in the city of Hyderabad. The place is ideal for fulfilling the cravings for delicious Chinese food.
Shanghai Chef 2,Hemanshu Bhushan,24 December 2018,2,"Food was not that not at all good .. just not able to have the name that they have got ..
I have ordered 2 items and was thinking to have more but by seeing the tase and planes to shift other place .
I have ordered chicken fried rice and I see chicken was not that well cooked and I can see chicken skin been used as that same have complained to management and they told me they use skin less chicken and they this might be a miss and told will change the order and they have replace it and again I got the new one but I was again I was disappointed to see the same mistake .."
Shanghai Chef 2,Elusha,21 December 2018,1,Worst chinese i have ever eaten !! The chopsuey was sweet and the paneer was bland !!!
Shanghai Chef 2,Pritha Majumder,17 December 2018,4,"The portions were quite good also the dumplings were pretty impressive. Though the wait time was a bit too long, but overall we had a good time."
Shanghai Chef 2,Singh Rahul,08 December 2018,2,"The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

So, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
With this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'Must Try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. Like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. This was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
On the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.Also, Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

So, coming back to first line. The rating is probably for food only, go at your own risk if your are looking for experience !"
Shanghai Chef 2,Arpana Majumder,07 December 2018,1,We found cockroach in the food!! Unhygienic pace! Dirty kitchen!! Horrible Staff and worst Manager! Please think twice before you order food from here
Shanghai Chef 2,Sai Vikas Vickky,06 December 2018,2,"Not a great place. It has ok ambience and good hospitality but the food isn't great. I've tried America chicken chopsuey, it's different from other chopsuey's out there and it's just average. I've tried the tei pei chicken starter and it was not great, the starter was not skinless and also the chicken was very chewy making it difficult to swallow. I've heard that momo's over here are good but I didn't want to try. Overall I wasn't satisfied."
Shanghai Chef 2,Rahul Reddy Yerrama Reddy,26 November 2018,5,I love Thai red curry here. Awesome Chinese food. So many options to try different foods. Ambience is good and staff is very friendly and recommend different varaities.
Shanghai Chef 2,Madhava,19 November 2018,4,Nice ambience. Courteous staff. Best place to have good Chinese menu. Starters was very good and the main course has good quantity and quality. Order will take some time to come.
Shanghai Chef 2,Irfan Ali,27 October 2018,5,I love this place for the soup - Tom Kha Gai/ Gung. Ask for chicken flavour of this soup. That's a must try. Nice ambiance too. And they served it lovely.
Shanghai Chef 2,Narayan Santuka,27 October 2018,1,We came here to enjoy some good Chinese food but instead were served with cockroach in American Chopsuey. We immediately showed that to the waiter and asked for the bill. They deduced that dish from the bill but again won't dare to go to that place again.. Was very disappointed..
Shanghai Chef 2,Pritish,27 October 2018,5,"Exiting food. Great service. Definitely pooKing forward to visiting again. One suggestion though, be available on all the food ordering apps, you're not."
Shanghai Chef 2,M.Y.,26 October 2018,1,"I have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!
Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!"
Shanghai Chef 2,Jayagopal Nair,21 October 2018,4,It's our default choice when we crave Chinese food and if we are around the Gachibowli area. The food tastes great and the fact that they are open all the way from lunch to dinner makes is a very viable option for a decent lunch at odd times in the evening when most other places are closed till dinner. The ambience has nothing to be complained about and the pricing is pretty decent.
Shanghai Chef 2,Vijay Bhanu,19 October 2018,1,"This place has lost its charm
Went for dinner today. Ordered honey crispy chicken and butter garlic prawns.
They served honey crispy chicken was waiting for butter garlic prawns. After 40 minutes the person comes and asks for main course order. I asked for butter garlic prawns he comes back after 5 minutes and says it‚Äôs not available.
Pathetic service they take almost an hour to tell you if a order is available or not. Better avoid it if these are the standards of this place wasting customers time"
Shanghai Chef 2,Prudhvi Raju,15 October 2018,1,Hi. This is a restraunt where even if the customer says the dish is bland and not tasty chef comes back and say it's the way that it gets cooked. No words more than that.
Shanghai Chef 2,Satish,03 October 2018,1,Ordered sesame chilly chicken for home delivery and it was one of the worst chicken dishes I have had. Chicken was like rubber and they had added so much spices that it was almost bitter. They didn't even have the sense to send a spoon or fork and some tissues.
Shanghai Chef 2,Lasya M,27 September 2018,1,ordered salt and pepper prawns : it was extrememly salty and we couldnt eat it
Shanghai Chef 2,Marta Nanda,26 September 2018,1,I ordered with them yesturday and got chicken in my veg pad thai!!! :( very disappointed with it as xhilli potato was really nice. I dont recommend anyway who is vegetarian as I couldn't even reach them on phone....
Shanghai Chef 2,Aruna Ranganathan,19 September 2018,1,Ordered veg fried rice. Was so bland and tasteless for the price! It smelled weird too. I somehow felt street food would have been much better and cost effective
Shanghai Chef 2,Rishabh Wahi,14 September 2018,3,"Decent ambience, not the perfect place if you're looking for authentic oriental cuisine. American chopsuey was reasonably good and the non veg platter was value for money, well quantity atleast."
Shanghai Chef 2,Kajori Roy,11 September 2018,4,The place was nice. The food was tasty. The ambience was not bad either.. Some of the stuff in the menu card was not there.. But overall it was a nice experience.
Shanghai Chef 2,The Greedy Hippo,03 September 2018,1,"I had high expectations of this restaurant but was dissapointed. I sometimes ponder to visit them again, because as per user reviews they are good.

The seating is well, the air conditioning is not. Its either chilly or completely stopped. You cant help it.

The servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

The food. Oh God! I dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. They were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

So many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was I unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. They also need a experienced manager.

Ambience : 2
Food: 2
Service : 0
Value for money : 1"
Shanghai Chef 2,Vasanthan Lr,01 September 2018,2,"Two stars explained, one for bearable ambience and another for bearable food. This is not a authentic Chinese restaurant. Not to be hateful but this place is just a fast food restaurant with better ambience.

If you want an authentic Chinese meal , don‚Äôt come here."
Shanghai Chef 2,Abdur Rahman,29 August 2018,2,"The only good thing about this place was friendly staff.
Rest assured was average.
Not so crowded either
Chopsey tasted like honey. Not up to the mark
It was chinese . It had to be a little spicy but a dissapointment.
Soup and starters were okay.
Also they switched off the A.C even when it wasnt late. Need to improve."
Shanghai Chef 2,Saiyam Surana,27 August 2018,1,I went to this place yesterday and we used zomato gold. The service was very disappointing. Restaurant was out of staff. Didn‚Äôt attend properly even when the place was not at all crowded. Food was also not upto the mark. Served after a long time.Heard alot about this place but..
Shanghai Chef 2,Krishna Kant Chaubey,27 August 2018,5,"Went to this place which a bunch of foodies for a review session and to my delight it turned out to be an awesome experience.
I always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one.
The service was very good along with a perfect ambience.
Lets begin with the food part:
We started with a couple of soups Tom Kha Gai (which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour) followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good.
Amongst the starters we tried Tei Pei Chicken,Kung pao Chicken, Phuket fish( this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy), Drawn prawns (nice crispy which nice sausage).
Now the best part was the Shu mai, the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great.
In the main course we had Phad Thai Phak(spicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too temptingüòã),Burmese Khow Suey which were steamed noodles with several add-ons like peanuts, fried onions etc. (a must try one if you visit this place).
We also had some mocktails my personal favorite was Fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch .....
The last but not the least the desert part we had fried ice-creams which had coconut base and it was very yummy üòã.
A nice place to visit if you are looking for some authentic chineese dishes."
Shanghai Chef 2,Nikitha Rao,27 August 2018,5,"Recently I went to this place for a review session with bunch of freaks. This place is located at indiranagar.
Service was really great .

When it come to chineese cuisine , I thought to order few authentic dishes .

Firstly they served us with soup : chicken manchow soup and tom kha gai/gung which is coconut based. People who likes coconut based cuisine then they must try this.
Coming to starters we ordered tai Pai chicken, dragon prawns, Kung Pao, Phuket fish, dumplings named shu mai. Out of these best was Phuket fish which was crispy frm outside .

Main course: They served us Burmese know suey , again this is coconut based dish where the gravy is made out of coconut . It's served with plain noodles , add ons like peanuts, fried onions , green chillies, variety of suaces .
Pad Thai rice which was just like fried rice .

They also serve mocktails and desert.
Fried ice cream was the best."
Shanghai Chef 2,Abhishek Gupta,27 August 2018,4,"I had visited few among many Chinese places in past. Recently got a chance to visit Shaghai Chef, located at prime location, Indra Nagar. Welcomed nicely by the staff members.

I didn't thought much about food in starting, as people don't eat Chinese daily and I am weak in remembering Chinese dishes name, I had one thing in my mind, Shezwan :P. But as soon as the dinner started, I was surprised, there is more to it, started with Tom kha gai/gung - Chicken Soup, Coconut based soup, creamy and smooth, with spices and topped with red chilli, one word, fantabulous. Then the marathon started, one after another I was enjoying every bite, had few expression changes in between but at end, the conclusion - amazing dinner.

Strated with starter, Tai pai chicken, Dragon prawns... Pakoda kind, tossed to give a spicy flavour, I am not a fan of prawns, so can't say, Kung puo chicken... Was decent, Phuket fish... basha fish, kind of crispy from outside, soft inside, tasted amazing, and the dumplings, named Shu mai, open dumplings with minced chicken, it's not spices but is simply wow, go for it. Tried few mocktails, was ok but need some improvement, other than that everything was good. And then the deserts, ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke, must try.

In main course we had, Burmese khow suey... Noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy, not spicy with stuffs to add on, liked fried peanut, fried onions, chillis, diff sauces etc. and Phad thai Rice, both were also good. Overall had a good time and dinner, the staff members made our food tasting visit more comfortable. Recommended for good dine in, one can go with dishes with must try tag, if unable to decide and can consult staff members for know about the dishes."
Shanghai Chef 2,Nelu J,26 August 2018,4,"This restaurant have got a very peaceful atmosphere so been to this place for dinner with friends.We ordered soups 1st were my favourite was Toma Gai/Gung which is a rich coconut milk based prawns Thai soup.We can taste the thick coconut milk taste and being a malayalee I always love the coconut taste and I just loved this one.It is a mild soup which give a small sweetness of coconut milk.Other two soups we ordered were manchow soup and Chicken lemon coriander soup.Manchow soup dint taste like how it is suppose to be.We ordered the chicken one so it was a spicy soup with a chilly and garlic combo and coming to the chicken lemon coriander soup,it had a strong taste of lemon with minced chicken and vegetables and I dint like that much but my friend who ordered this soup loved this.

Now coming to the starters,we ordered Dragon prawns,Tei pei chicken,Kung puo chicken,Shu mai dumplings,Phuket fish.We were served with dragon prawns first which was crispy added into a sauce and garnished with cashew nuts kinda dish which is spicy.Tei Pei dish was a starter which I loved than the dragon prawns one,which is mildy sweet one and not too spicy like dragon prawns.So the last starter we tried was Phuket fish which was cooked well and it was fried kinda hard and added to soya sauce and tasted awesome.Coming to djmoljngs we had Shu mai dumplings which are steamed and half opened dumplings which was tasting too good with the chilly sauce.

We ordered mocktails after the starter and we had Fall in Love which I really loved which had a mixed taste of both litchi and strawberry,Litchi Punch which I ordered which doesn't give the colour of litchi and dint give too much of litchi taste,alfonza which is of mango and tasted great and also fruit punch which was a mixed fruit mocktail.They have mentioned mocktail with scoop of ice cream so I dint find a scoop in it or don't know whether they mix it with the juice and serve but all were tasting great.

Now coming to the main course we had Burmese khow suey and Phad Thai phak.We had the Burmese dish which was ma favourite again as it is made of rich coconut milk and noodles one and too yummy for your tummy dish.This dish was served with other set of seasonings and condiments so people do try this one and you will love this and this is creamy non-spicy dish.Phad Thai Phak which was of rice type garnished with an egg omelette which is like a fried rice dish and a spicy one.

Last we had fried ice cream and brownie with ice-cream as desserts.Both were yummy where brownie ice cream was served with butterscotch ice cream flavour with a strawberry sauce as the topping and fried ice-cream coating is made of coconut so do try these."
Shanghai Chef 2,Aravind,23 August 2018,1,"Not recommended , food is not tasty better change yiur Chef2 & call Chef1
Food quality is bad n taste is worst n got cold not at all acceptable"
Shanghai Chef 2,Rahul,21 August 2018,4,"I am frequent here, like their noodles varieties. Almost tried every non veg noodles and rice items. I like it if not love it. I don't mind ambience here coz I love Chinese but ambience is okay. Service is good. Price is affordable. Prawns dishes are very pleasing either with rice or noodles."
Shanghai Chef 2,Kripah16,18 August 2018,1,"I ordered the pad thai noodles. All the veggies were under cooked and raw and the noodles were over cooked. There was no chewiness in the noodles. Completely tasteless.
Extremely disappointing experience today as I have already ordered the same item earlier also and it used to be good before."
Shanghai Chef 2,Susmita Basu,18 August 2018,5,I loved the food. Authentic Chinese and nice ambience. Taste was really good. Had rice noodles after a long time and it was pretty good. The lamb and dragon prawns are must try.
Shanghai Chef 2,Shravya Gunipudi,15 August 2018,4,"Loved the food. Very cute ambience. Service was the downside, though. Despite the crowd being normal and not heavy, none of the waiters were in sight when we needed them.

That being said, I recommend the wontons, the manchow soup and the chilly paneer. Fried rice was a little insipid but other than that, a definite recommendation."
Shanghai Chef 2,Ishita Narain,15 August 2018,3,"Thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good.
A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. I absolutely loved it.
Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. I did not find anything very special in it. Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there."
Shanghai Chef 2,Soumyaphogat95,11 August 2018,4,"Pocket friendly, quick service and quiet ambience makes this place a must visit for its Chinese Chopsey, Mee Goreng and Nasi Goreng Nenus. Serves fresh and good quantity for its price."
Shanghai Chef 2,Puja Chaurasia,06 August 2018,5,"Food is amazingly delicious & its pocket friendly too.
Nice simple ambiance , staffs are well mannered. Even one can go with their suggestion in the menu..
Most of food items i tasted veg & non veg both & its up to the mark."
Shanghai Chef 2,Roma,06 August 2018,5,awesome awesome awesome
Shanghai Chef 2,Ankit Jain,04 August 2018,3,"Nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service.
The restuarant is located on first floor ,having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors -appropriately giving a glimpse of typical Chinese restaurant .Not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too ! I hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor (4/5)

The crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us .After exchanging a few words ,he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab .
Owner and staff courtesy (5/5)

We first ordered talumein soup(3.5/5)-moderately spicy and filled with veggies ,which is certainly a healthy start

We ordered mee gorang noodles (3.5/5) - comprised of lots of green and red chillies .a perfect form of noodles to relish .
Recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles

Noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy(3/5) which Went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of French beans that hindered the potential of dish."
Shanghai Chef 2,AbstractFoodie,02 August 2018,3,Food was okay. We ordered two chicken dishes for starters and it had too much sauce in it. Noodles were good. Monis were really good though. Would try again rest was okay. Would try again if no options are available. :/
Shanghai Chef 2,Rahul Agarwal,31 July 2018,3,"Ok place. The food was just fine, but since it is reasonably priced, its decent value for money.
Service is ordinary though.
On a sunday afternoon, the place was empty and it was hard to digest. I almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway.
Bottom line, if i want to eat relatively inexpensive Chinese food, then this might be a choice, else no."
Shanghai Chef 2,Princy Singh Rajput,29 July 2018,4,"One of my favourite Chinese Restaurant in Hyderabad

Good and authenticate chinese restaurant. The ambiance was decent, nothing fancy. Just a sober place to enjoy food.

Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
Ambience - 3/5"
Shanghai Chef 2,Ashutosh Tiwari,27 July 2018,5,"Nice place for Chinese lovers... Decent music, nice ambience. Food is really very tasty. We visit almost every time we have a Chinese craving..."
Shanghai Chef 2,Suryansh Tiwari,26 July 2018,1,very high priced low quality food
Shanghai Chef 2,Deepika,21 July 2018,5,nice
Shanghai Chef 2,Vipul Charan,20 July 2018,5,"delivered on time

Shanghai Chef 2,Sourya Satabdi,18 July 2018,3,the quantity of soup was half of what they provide at the restaurant
Shanghai Chef 2,Kalam Ramnarayan Reddy,15 July 2018,3,"Food was good but please send some forks, tissues and sauce packets from next time..."
Shanghai Chef 2,Anurag Reddy,15 July 2018,5,"Good food, nice ambience. Friendly staff. Order time is more. Platters are good. Desserts and mocktails are overpriced for their quality and quantity."
Shanghai Chef 2,Rita Singh,15 July 2018,5,"What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special."
Shanghai Chef 2,Mr. Mighty,14 July 2018,5,"An awesome place to enjoy Chinese. It looks very ordinary from the outside but the interior of the restaurant is very classy. The ambience is really very good. The most amazing and surprising part of this restaurant is it's food. I was so amazed with the food. It's a 100% must go place for all foodies. The prices matches the quantity+quality and doesn't leave a hole in your pocket. This sets the restaurant miles apart in comparison to other similar level Chinese restaurant.
This restaurant will definitely be one of my top favourites while considering Chinese."
Shanghai Chef 2,Nandini Rathaur,12 July 2018,1,"The gravy were very dilute
Every time we order it is thick
This time I ordered more quantity and received it thinner. I actually paid more for less."
Shanghai Chef 2,Shaiwal Sachdev,09 July 2018,5,So tasty yummy ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shanghai Chef 2,Dhaya Mathew,09 July 2018,1,"Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight‚Äôs order."
Shanghai Chef 2,Sujyosna,08 July 2018,1,"Food was worst and it came with a strong smell of oil. Chilly garlic noodle did not have any garlic, not even the flavour. All the items were really not eatable."
Shanghai Chef 2,Bhargavi Das,08 July 2018,4,Good place for chinese cuisine lover. We ordered chiken manchurian and singapore fried rice. The fried rice was ok ok...tasted average. Chiken manchurian was lil spicy but liked it. Good for one time visitüôÇ
Shanghai Chef 2,Kritin Jp,07 July 2018,3,Not exactly the best place for value for money and food isn't exactly the best either..meat is chewy and badly cooked...ambience is a good thumbs up however
Shanghai Chef 2,Jinet Jose,07 July 2018,3,very salty
Shanghai Chef 2,Nishant Singh,06 July 2018,3,it was a ok ok
Shanghai Chef 2,Shubhamjuneja41,03 July 2018,4,"Food and service was good!
I ordered lemon coriander soup,honey chilli potato and schezwan noodles.
Soup was just okay.
Honey chilli potato was tasty but could have been more crispy.
Schezwan noodles were tasty
Overall good experience."
Shanghai Chef 2,Jinet Jose,03 July 2018,3,was very salty
Shanghai Chef 2,Singh.aprajita.03,02 July 2018,1,Got a piece of mirror in the food.
Shanghai Chef 2,Gayathri Neela,30 June 2018,5,worth.
Shanghai Chef 2,Shruti Mittal,28 June 2018,2,Chilli paneer was bad.. Paneer was stale... Rest all fine
Shanghai Chef 2,Rekha,26 June 2018,1,We ordered sea food bamboo rice and it tasted worse... Rotten smell from the rice made me sick... Ordered Kung Pao chicken.. we asked for something spicy and they suggested Kung Pao chicken.. but it is sweet ! I never knew that something sweet is actually meant to be spicy at Shanghai Chef!! We also ordered black pepper chicken curry and manchow soup... These two were ok
Shanghai Chef 2,Kamalesh VM Sai,24 June 2018,4,good authentic chinese
Shanghai Chef 2,Sonal Sai,23 June 2018,4,"Saturday's lunch from Shanghai Chef 2 didn't go bad!
I ordered Chicken Chilli Garlic Rice and Oyster Chicken.

The rice was perfectly cooked, with the ingredients giving out their individual flavors.
The chicken, soft and juicy, was a great delight.
The quantity of food provided was definitely more than enough for 2 people with below average appetite.

Would certainly recommend to try out this place!"
Shanghai Chef 2,All That Is Gourmet,23 June 2018,4,"This place has not failed to delight us. Of the multiple times that my friends, family and I have dined there, not one has been disappointing. The food is fresh, tasty and also visually appealing. The staff is friendly and the service is prompt. The restaurant is clean and maintained. I recommend this place for good value Chinese food."
Shanghai Chef 2,Madhu Vanam,23 June 2018,1,Teriyaki chicken quantity was very little. Kung pao vegetables have no veggies in it. Just full of sauce.
Shanghai Chef 2,Narsimha,22 June 2018,4,it's good
Shanghai Chef 2,SAURAV MAITY,18 June 2018,5,"the food offered has its standard. tastes good , offers good amount at good price."
Shanghai Chef 2,Aparna Saha,16 June 2018,5,First of all just love the ambience and food was absolutely good...specially the crab meat soup...just wow...only the thing is thai raosted chiken is filled with a heavy coconut cream ..otherwise its good
Shanghai Chef 2,Nilesh Patil,14 June 2018,1,"I had pretty ""authentic"" Chinese food here. Along with chilli sauce and chicken pieces in noodles, they served few insects as well. Staff is also quite cool and composed. Even after showing it to them, he just walked away with the bowl and didn't even bothered to say sorry. Respect!!"
Udipi's Upahar,Raviteja,12 May 2019,2,"Ok ok food is not that tastey & I will not recommend this place for eating
Place is not so clean & the kitchen counter is not good. Cost is more"
Udipi's Upahar,Dileep,04 May 2019,4,Good south Indian breakfast items .. u can try all the south indian items like idly and diffrnt kinds of dosas ... Also u can try out various chutneys
Udipi's Upahar,Prakash Behera,28 April 2019,4,"This place serve best South Indian food with awesome taste . I had iddli there and it's very floppy and taste is nice . It's better to pack food and eat at home , if you are alone or with friends then you can eat here . It is always crowed"
Udipi's Upahar,Ha,26 March 2019,4,"Very good place to breakfast! Yes, the sitting area a problematic. Even to stand also its bit cramp as this place is always crowded for its best food.

Sometimes my day starts with a lip licking breakfast from here.
üòçü§§"
Udipi's Upahar,Manikanta Annamraju,03 March 2019,5,The food they prepare is very good than other udipi hotels. The way they do parcel and the care they take for taste is good. Good food at good price.
Udipi's Upahar,Yada Roopavathi,28 February 2019,4,"Ambience is okay but the food is good. Regular Idly, Sambar Idly, Poori, Mysore Bonda, Dosa are good. Sambar, chutney are good in taste. A definite place to try the food."
Udipi's Upahar,Ananya,04 February 2019,5,If it hadn‚Äôt been for my friend this place would have simple gone unnoticed. Your typical road side eatery and must have breakfast destinations. The pipping hot vadas are the best I‚Äôve had. Restricted myself to just one vada so that I could try other items. Butter steamed dosa and karampudi idli were good too. Visited this place on both the days for breakfast during my 2-day visit to Hyderabad.
Udipi's Upahar,Hari Krishna,01 February 2019,2,"Not up to mark as per it‚Äôs brand name.


Food is just like ordinary tiffin centre‚Äôs

Need to improve and provide food really authentic of Udipi
Ambiance is really awkward no cleanliness even in Ac family section also"
Udipi's Upahar,Raj Rohit,28 January 2019,5,"A regular tiffin place in gachibowli. Their idlis, Mysore bondas and vadas are all wonderful.
The sambat idlis are great too.

+ Super fast delivery"
Udipi's Upahar,Saketh Vasista,13 January 2019,3,"FoodFor Friends in regards with taste it's too good but if you want to order something you need to be aware of packing.
Packing is not good i ordered sambar idly and they didnt gave me spoon how can a person eat sambar idly with put spoon.
Need to maintain those things other than that food is too good.
I will prefer to visit"
Udipi's Upahar,Ashok Prabhakaran,31 December 2018,4,"One of the best places to have South Indian tiffin varieties in Gachibowli area.  Most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. I enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.  If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. 

Situated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. 

Absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out. 

My fav of theirs is the Dosa. I just loved the Chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste. Also loved the Kerala Parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in Chennai."
Udipi's Upahar,Pradeep Koney,29 December 2018,5,"Great place for a quick breakfast in Indira Nagar area. Dosas, Poori are good and the restaurant serve food faster. Hot beverages are available too."
Udipi's Upahar,Apoorva Kulkarni,25 December 2018,4,"Whenever we‚Äôre in Gachibowli, we definitely have our breakfast here. The quality of food is really good. And all the tiffins tastes amazing. My favourite is Vada."
Udipi's Upahar,Kaushik Padmanaban,09 December 2018,4,"When I first reached Hyderabad, I wanted to eat dosa and idli. Just like the ones I had in Chennai. So, after some research, I reached Udupi's upahar. The sambar was sweeter than I expected. I believe it is the Karnataka style. I still liked it. The Bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low. Great experience. I would like it if they had spicier sambar."
Udipi's Upahar,Naveen Kumar,01 December 2018,5,"No frills place. Many families frequent this restaurant. There is air conditioned seating area below. Don't expect great service, but the service will be quick. Prices reasonable. Pineapple kesari and parota kurma are must have."
Udipi's Upahar,Princy Singh Rajput,04 November 2018,4,"If you are looking for a good South Indian breakfast, then this place is a must-go. Prices is rather higher than any usual shop, but the quality would make worth spending that money.

Good variety. Good taste. Decent staff. Have options for chat, tea,coffee stall as well"
Udipi's Upahar,Shashank Okhde,26 October 2018,4,"Nice place for budget outing. Generally taste of all items is good and very reasonable. Regular place of visit of us when in hurry, Quick service. Good parcel option for quick takeaways. South Indian food is better here compared to North Indian food. Juice and Tea counter outside helps."
Udipi's Upahar,Suresh Neralla,15 October 2018,3,"Used to be great for tasty breakfast, now almost flat taste, unless have other options no more a must have place.

Service standard - okay
Pricing - okay
Parking - unless peak hours - can find one."
Udipi's Upahar,Ankita,02 October 2018,4,"Good food, loved the south Indian dishes over here plus the ordering system is good. But I feel, they should have some more space. It gets hoch poch when it's crowded. Overall nice experience."
Udipi's Upahar,Nalin Venkat Sameera,01 October 2018,4,"I was here with my dad for a quick tiffin/ snack time on our way home. Frankly speaking, I wasn't expecting such good food. We had Masala Dosa, Idli and Vada. I felt there could have been a better variety of chutneys (like tamarind or ginger) apart from the regular coconut one. Not only did the food make us feel satiated, but also satisfied."
Udipi's Upahar,FooD HUNTer,01 October 2018,4,I ordered so many times here food was really good and the sambar is good to have but chutney is not at all good and set dosa poori with kurma good to have all they have to do is to improve CHUTNEY!!!! PACKING 5/5
Udipi's Upahar,SD,28 September 2018,4,It has the best rava idlis that you can get. I usually visit this place early in the morning on weekends. It‚Äôs always crowded. They have a seating area downstairs as well. It‚Äôs a place where you can have a quick bite and enjoy a cup of tea.
Udipi's Upahar,Nevia Singhal,23 September 2018,4,"The best Coconut chutney and Sambhar in town. Pick any food item and its delicious. You can say that by the crowd at their place to get anything. Must try Idli-sambhar, Poori Bhaji, Butter pav bhaji."
Udipi's Upahar,Ashish,18 September 2018,5,"My go to place for all my South Indian Tiffin fixes in the city!
Their pesarratu set dosas and podi idli is to die for!
Ginger chai on the go is absolutely perfect for all kind of chai lovers!"
Udipi's Upahar,Lucky Pathania,25 August 2018,5,Whatever you order from there or eat their it‚Äôs alway good & delicious. Their Pineapple Kesari Bath is one of the best. The way they server food on banana leaf is awesome & there are very few veg restaurants who serve food that way.
Udipi's Upahar,Amol Lakhe,19 August 2018,4,"The Coconut chutney here is great.
Food is prepared with less oil.
Do try Cheese Dosa and Bisibelle Bath.
Also try Ginger Tea available at Udipi Tea stall.
Tea is very good in flavour."
Udipi's Upahar,Anuj Kumar,18 August 2018,1,Rudest billing staff ever. Didn't provide change. Worst customer service. Never going again. Don't know how to treat the customers. Many options available.
Udipi's Upahar,Mansi Saraswat,14 August 2018,4,"This place is my default option for south indian breakfast. Located right on the Gachibowli-Kothaguda road, this place serves Poha, idli, dosa, uttapam, poori sabzi etc. Personally I prefer their south indian food.
There is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well.

If you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it won't disappoint you!

Happy eating! :)"
Udipi's Upahar,Sneha Paul,06 August 2018,4,"Udipi's is perhaps one of the best budget friendly joints in the indiranagar area. Their ghee idly is a must try and so are their dosas. If you are there for breakfast, do try their poha."
Udipi's Upahar,Sudarshan S,03 August 2018,5,nice
Udipi's Upahar,Karishma Bhatt,02 August 2018,4,"This is one of the place, where you can find all the foods in a very reasonable price but it doesn't mean that you have to compromise with your taste buds. I have tried Veg manchurian, gobi manuchurian, idli sambhar, vada sambhar, dahi vada, dosa ( must try ) , puri and curry and poha. I tried one unique combination here and that is plain dosa with veg manchurian, and it was just yummm. I would suggest you as well to try this. ‚úåÔ∏è"
Udipi's Upahar,Lekha Lavanya Chadaram,01 August 2018,1,chutney is not at all good
Udipi's Upahar,Sreetam Das,30 July 2018,5,cool
Udipi's Upahar,Yashwanth Aluru,29 July 2018,4,"Good place. We went to its AC seating area in the cellar. Had butter masala dosa, karampodi idly and Ravva dosa. All were satisfactory . Sambar was bot good but Chutney was good."
Udipi's Upahar,Sandeep Banda,29 July 2018,4,Requested to replace Sambar with Chutney but that was not done.

Mathura Vilas,Manish Garg,21 May 2019,1,There are garlic peels in my garlic naan. Not just one but almost every where. Staff was least bothered in this concern. They don't remove garlic peels from naan
Mathura Vilas,Amar Singh,20 May 2019,5,Good food pocket friendly and healthy. I have ordered few times for luch and I liked it. If you have office nearby order food from this place.
Mathura Vilas,Ritika Shah,13 May 2019,1,"Very rude staff and bad service. Disapppinted. Decent food.Good harabhara kabab. Have been there multiple times I. Last, never faced such bad service. The manager was very rude, disinterested and had no concern with any grievances. The bill desk guy apologised on his behalf, but the manager just chose to walk away."
Mathura Vilas,Hari,07 May 2019,5,"Good place to dine , south indian dishes are amazing and mouth watering . One can dine with family anytime who love pure vegetarian food and brunches rather than lunch"
Mathura Vilas,Nishant Singh,05 May 2019,1,"Very bad service. 90% time you will keep on waiting for food. Even when i ordered thali, thwy took more than half n hour to bring it. Even the food was nothing compare to Rajdhani....."
Mathura Vilas,SAI PRASANTH .M,03 May 2019,1,"Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.
Arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?

Service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.

Ambiance 1/5 -
Some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
In short a worthless place.

Food quality and taste 1/5.
Coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
Very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
As mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.

Value for money - 0.5/5

For these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all."
Mathura Vilas,Karthik Mns,30 April 2019,1,"Food is pricey and portion size is not justified. Serving is super slow. Tons tons of improvement required. If I have a choice, I'd avoid this place."
Mathura Vilas,Vamshi Adi,28 April 2019,4,Good one. You get a combination of south and north Indian varieties in a single thali. The servicing here is very slow. I have been here twice and it took more than half an hour to get the starters. Staff are polite and friendly.
Mathura Vilas,Aishwarya Pati,21 April 2019,5,Excellent food. Excellent service. If you want to experience North Indian cuisine..then this is the best place to be in. The prices are also appropriate and the food quantity is good
Mathura Vilas,Murari Setty Gnana Vinay,21 April 2019,1,Ambience was good.But the service was toooo bad.No one will take care after you order the food.its really pathetic.we need to ask for food repeatedly ..After 45 min they brought one starter and for main course they took one hour of time.Never prefer this restaurant
Mathura Vilas,Aziz Ajju,18 April 2019,1,"I ordered today veg fried rice, veg curry, rumali roties and onion raita.
but when it was delivered the onion raita was missing in the delivery for which I had paid 59 rs. 
I am soo disappointed with this order discrprency."
Mathura Vilas,Pankaj Mittal,17 April 2019,1,"I found this place pathetic. Went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. The excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. I wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.
I read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. And restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant I found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. I travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.

Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

Overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.

Avoid this restaurant at all cost !!!"
Mathura Vilas,Sushmita Mishra,15 April 2019,1,I visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. This is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. But yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. It took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. Then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. After 40 minutes the food was served. But the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out.
Mathura Vilas,Sridevi Bp,14 April 2019,1,Have been a regular customer. But waa totally dissatisfied today. Had to wait for 10 mins even to be served water. They are very short staffed and the manager is just not polite. They need to really up their service. Will think to go back again.
Mathura Vilas,Sai Krishna,13 April 2019,1,Quality and quantity is very less for Biryani combo.it is not worth of 150 rs.As a team we ordered 18 plates which is not sufficient.please look into it.
Mathura Vilas,BDM,13 April 2019,4,Good thali spread for Ugadi. The taste and overall experience was good. Service was slow for non thali orders and had to ask multiple times to refill dal and Sambhar in the thali
Mathura Vilas,Sumit,08 April 2019,1,"Overrated restaurant with pathetic service and average food. Spent 2.5 hours just for starters and main course. Had 2 rounds of rotis before paneer sabzi arrived. After asking manager that we have ordered main course more than half hour back, he told that you have ordered only 5 mins back. After this episode also it came after half an hour more. Visit the place if you have free time and want Air condition. Nothing else you can expect."
Mathura Vilas,ANNAM NARESH,01 April 2019,1,One of the worst in and around gachibowli. I ordered two rice combo and sent one and collected money for two. Such a non sense guy. The mathura villas owner. Never believe in their words.
Mathura Vilas,Vijay Karthik,31 March 2019,3,"We have ordered veg chilly sticks and golden baby corn.
Veg chilly sticks are good and must try. Golden fry baby corn and veg biryani are worst"
Mathura Vilas,Chaitanya,26 March 2019,3,Had been to this place for a lunch. Decent place - had a South Indian thali. Food is okay - but can be a better in terms of taste. Decent ambience & Service. But something is a miss hereü§î
Mathura Vilas,Prathyusha Subraveti,23 March 2019,1,"Extremely disappointed with the service. They delayed serving the food. The staff is very lethargic and don't seem to care. Save your time. Go elsewhere. By the by, the pepper curry was the worst. Don't try searching for this in menu for this dish. It isn't there. They added so much of pepper, it felt like some chef's spontaneous idea which messed up our palate. -_-"
Mathura Vilas,Sreya Sreetam Raychaudhury,23 March 2019,1,"Ours was not a good experience, poor hospitali
ty, slow service n bad temperament from the manager. Not likely to visit again.. disappointed !!! üòíüòí üòíüòí"
Mathura Vilas,Ramu,22 March 2019,1,Staff is very reckless and they are least bother about the customer. We left without having lunch for keeping wait for more then 30 mins and the manager even not ask us to wait. He went inside to cancel the order
Mathura Vilas,Dinesh Naidu,19 March 2019,3,"Visited this afternoon, pleasant ambience, temple like feeling with a bell at the door and a idol at entrance. Ordered North Indian thali, taste was okay, not an extraordinary thali though. Served butter rotis, Jeera rice and white rice,5 curries, dal. Payasam and Kheer. Kheer was the highlight which I want to call out.
Ambience 3/5
Food 3/5
Service 4/5"
Mathura Vilas,Jay Tripathy,19 March 2019,5,Loved the collection and flavour of Indian cuisines and homely food. The staff are humble and will present food as per your customisation. That‚Äôs really good.
Mathura Vilas,Sathish Kumar Akula,19 March 2019,2,Never order full meals online... At the end you will get disappointed with incorrect items.. From the given menu... Expected alot by seeings reviews.
Mathura Vilas,Rahul Agarwal,17 March 2019,1,"For some reasons unknown to me, I decided to try this place. The thali on the other zomato reviews seemed worth a try I thought.
I was told thali would take 15 min, and I waited. After 25 min of waiting, when I started asking around, they said thali isn't available right now and will take another 20 min minimum. I lost it. No shame, no options to offer what could be served quickly. Just a plain no. I walked up, they asked me to pay for a bottle of water (which I consumed) and left. The manager didn't even bother.
Went to Over the moon next door and had a great exp. Folkd there told me this outliet of MV is in bad shape and likely to close soon.
If you want to take a chance of really poor exp, maybe no food, maybe bad food..."
Mathura Vilas,Richa Goyal,17 March 2019,4,"Visited with family.
Overall decent ambience and decent veg food.

If looking for a pure veg place with decent ambience then this could be your place"
Mathura Vilas,Kumar Abhishek,16 March 2019,3,"Had been here on Pongal to have ""Veg Lunch"" since my uncle and aunt were in hyderabad. My aunt insisted on having laccha paratha there which when arrived was found to be regular butter roti and the staff even insisted on the same funda that it was laccha paratha. This was a turn off for me but otherwise it is good veg restaurant to visit in gachibowli area.
So here goes my rating

Food:3/5
Ambience:4/5
Service:3/5
Budget: 3/5

Hope i will have a good exeperience tge next time i visit Mathura Vilas.

P. S: I was able to use my Zomato gold here on food."
Mathura Vilas,Eyyunni Shanta,08 March 2019,5,"Too good and place is very fine. Food is lovely and delicious. Hotel is nice.....
I have never seen like this. Desert is lovely and different from other place."
Mathura Vilas,Prs M,28 February 2019,1,"Very bed experience.. they have created problem in deduction for zomato gold multiple times.
Zomato should take action against this restaurant."
Mathura Vilas,Ram.bhattiprolu198305,27 February 2019,1,"This restaurant has gone way below the acceptable quality levels. Had been a great place to go earlier but looks like they have started compromising in quality of food and service. Items on the menu aren‚Äôt available but offered what they had at that time. Rice was watery, none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable. Will never come here again."
Mathura Vilas,Akshat Jaiswal,24 February 2019,1,"This place was a good veg eatery earlier, with options of good thali..but the experience which we had today completely my opinion.
Food was cold, service was very slow, dirty tables and wares and Ill maintained wash rooms. And on top of it misleadinƒ£ offer of 25% discount. I just had my last visit today."
Mathura Vilas,Ram Sashank Dinavahi,24 February 2019,4,"Decent place for veg lovers. Tried South Indian Veg thali, it was served with wide variety of items which were tasty. Quality of the items could be improved a bit."
Mathura Vilas,Yashwanth Kanuru,23 February 2019,4,"South and North thalis are their go to options with good spread of varieties in them. Ambience is decent for dining with family. Only drawback is their slow service, they typically take 20-25 mins to get the thali. You might not find it crowded, but don‚Äôt let that fool you, it is a good place."
Mathura Vilas,Madhava,15 February 2019,2,Very busy place. Rude waitress. Thalis are very nice here but don‚Äôt try any other varieties because they taste very bad. I had very bad experience. Only vegetarian food.
Mathura Vilas,Kiran Valipa,14 February 2019,4,This place is really hiding next to the Gachibowli Flyover. This is undoubtedly the best North Indian Thali in Hyderabad. Been there twice and never was disappointed. The taste of all the items in the Thali was amazing. I hope they maintain that quality. The Ambiance is good and the staff is quite friendly who oblige you on your request for Roti instead of Puri. The South Indian Thali needs a tad bit improvement. Best vegetarian Thali in town! Food taste 4Service 5Ambience 4Value for Money 4
Mathura Vilas,Sai Charan,13 February 2019,1,"Yesterday we have been to Mathura Vilas first time had ala kart, oh my God too much expensive and not worth of against quantity we ordered
Kaju masala which is 265 inclusive of all taxes, he just gave in very small bowl, and ordered butter naan which is again looting only like 70rs each butter naan inclusive of all taxes, and coming to cool drink it's like ditched 70rs inclusive of all taxes. They simply loot your purse and money,"
Mathura Vilas,Poojitha,10 February 2019,2,"I have been my third time here.
The food is quite good here. But when it comes to service we need a lot of patience.i have experienced the same third time.we had to wait for quite long time for food and even the bill

Food - 3/5
Ambience-3/5
Service-1/5

Need to improve in this factor"
Mathura Vilas,Upendra Bandi,10 February 2019,1,"Firstly the seating tables and chairs interiors all are awesome but the foooooood when compared with its pricing did not meet the minimum standards I could it is worst the butter naan is charged at a rs 60 ? Huhh the worst naan I ever ate and service what a pity I should stand and call a person for service and totally this restaurant is worthless for the service and the pricing
The pricing is very premium and the taste ! What a road side small dabas are very far better than this"
Mathura Vilas,Satya Kiran,07 February 2019,4,"Exceeded expectations, to frame it simply. Simply loved the pure vegetarian food after a long time even being a Non-vegetarian. All the starters we ordered are awesome. Main course curries are good, but not as good as starters. Ambience is good, serving has to be bit fast."
Mathura Vilas,Sreepad Parigi,06 February 2019,2,Average food. Have come across small amounts of mud in the food. They take a lot of time to serve food. The menu is also not that special given the name of the restaurant which belies it.
Mathura Vilas,Anuj Jain,02 February 2019,5,"Pure vegetarian will like this place..really liked chilli vegetable sticks, thali and roti basked option..staff is very nice and courteous...."
Mathura Vilas,Saikiran K,20 January 2019,1,"Ordered north Indian Thali, tastes bad, most of the curries are bad in taste, except one which is panneer. I had a feeling that chole curry was prepared yesterday and it smells & tasts bad. They served 2 sweets, semiya and kirayi. Only Semiya tastes good."
Mathura Vilas,Rahul Singh,19 January 2019,1,"Very poor service. People are very slow, you have to wait for 15 minutes to get one item. The funny part is even for giving bill they take ages as if they are not interested in taking money as well. I will never recommend this place to anyone because of its poor service."
Mathura Vilas,Rajinish Kumar,17 January 2019,4,"Super place for vegans, the food quantity is good enough, quality is also great, but the old boring music.ambience is nice, it is an efforable place for families"
Mathura Vilas,Thrylokya Yakkala,09 January 2019,4,"Serving was good taste also good more quantity of staters but it taste good for veg it's good option but they take more time get a dish, nice place"
Mathura Vilas,Shilpi Jain,07 January 2019,3,"This is a simple place to dine out. Casual sitting with apt lighting. There Thali and al- karte both are equally good and but prices are on a little higher side specially breads.

Service is fine. Good for pure vegetarians"
Mathura Vilas,Deepthi Karnam,04 January 2019,3,"We had been to the restaurant for lunch and ordered of course the south indian thali. It was served almost as shown in the pictures. 

Ambiance: Small & simple. The background music on Kanhaiyya was very soothing.
Service: Was ok. No major issues.
Food: Food was good, definitely not exceptional but worth trying. The poori, poori's sabzi, pachadi, sweet & curd are very tasty.
Price: Slightly expensive."
Mathura Vilas,Madhav Bhartia,03 January 2019,5,"#Food was #good with right mix of #spices. We went in a group of 6. As soon as we entered they offered #seats and welcomed us. We had two kids with us they gave complimentary #ice #creams for them. It helped us making kids busy while we decided on the menu. Menu had a good #vegetarian variety (we were looking for veg food). We ordered #north #indian #thali, which was yummy. It covered a good mix of curries.

Overall food is good. Just have to be a bit patient as I felt they were slow on service after ordering food (it may be because it had a parallel birthday party going on and was a bit crowded."
Mathura Vilas,Neetika Sahai,02 January 2019,2,I have been to this place for random dinner with friends and it was the most stupid decision.. The place is the perfect example of mismanagement. The food was also pathetic. We have ordered sambhar rice after a lot of disappointment thinking that atleast it will come on time and will be good in taste but I guess they were checking our patience and it took almost 20-25mins for us to get that. They were so slow even in providing bill and on top of that they have added service charge without even our notice. I have given two stars only because the manager / owner (not sure) was really very courteous and he has asked not to pay by acknowledging our complaints.
Mathura Vilas,Jyotshna Reddy,31 December 2018,1,"Food - Too salty and I did not understand how can someone go wrong with something as easy as bisebella bath.
Even the Other items were very average and salty

Staff - with only twenty percent occupancy, the staff forgot the order. And in General the service is lousy

Ambience - its neat and satwik.

I would recommend to give this restaurant a pass. Its not worth the time and money."
Mathura Vilas,Jaya Gubrele,30 December 2018,4,"Had a great time in Mathura vilas, ambience is okayish.. Staff was friendly but server presented all the starters and main course at one go which was little weird and by that time food was cold.. ‚òπÔ∏è"
Mathura Vilas,Rahul Otreja,24 December 2018,4,"Went to Mathura vilas after long time...we ordered paneer tikka masala and dal makhani...Both items were very good...Roti and Naan were also good...
Overall -
1. Food taste is good
2. Service is slow
3. Roti/Naan/Parantha are on expensive side"
Mathura Vilas,Sanket Ghate,16 December 2018,5,"Combo veg thali... Worth to buy it... Excellent taste ..
You can feel taste of each and every food item I'm that thali .
At end basmati rice has super aroma .."
Mathura Vilas,Meghana,16 December 2018,3,"Went here for lunch with family members, ordered South Indian thali which is way more better than chutneys. Ambiance was okay. Service can be improved as we have to ask more than once to refill few items. Overall a good experience."
Mathura Vilas,Karan Hemnani,14 December 2018,4,"Food: its an awesome place. We visit once in 2 months with family covering a large distance due to taste of various items in its north & south thali. One could order more of any item of their like from the thali as its not limited.

Service: sometime is slow, restaurant not ready for more customers or waiters lie on face that item is over and still serve to other customers before us then chef comes to rescue. The chef is courteous as takes feedback and works on it.

Over nice place for quality food, not everything is 100% hence 4 star rating."
Mathura Vilas,Rishabh Kumar,10 December 2018,4,"I wants to try some veg cuisines, so found this place on zomato. I ordered Tandoori mushroom and Veg soft noodles. Both the dishes was good and tasty. Both the dishes were prepared in very less oil. Ambiance was also good."
Mathura Vilas,Vbohra2009,04 December 2018,3,Bad service and the attitude of the staff is bad as well. The food was good both in terms of taste and quality had they been good service would have been good experience.
Mathura Vilas,Kumar,01 December 2018,5,"Mathura vilas restaurant is a really great
We are thali also south or north is a great
And ambiance was good
Service staff wehaver an attitude was fine
I am visit again..."
Mathura Vilas,Tanmay Agarwal,30 November 2018,1,Worst service food. Those who want blood pressure problem may visit. Every thing highly saalted. Don't go on name mathura it's local. Worst food worst service
Mathura Vilas,Suchata Biswas,29 November 2018,3,"Ordered malai kofta.. very sweet n has a peculiar after taste.. the butter naan was chewy only the tandoori roti was good, the only think i liked."
Mathura Vilas,Ricky,24 November 2018,4,"We ordered veg Thali here and trust me on this, food taste was good. Perhaps they can do better on buttermilk area. Serve in medium or large glass guys. We did not order tequila shots. Average price levels. Place to be with your office colleagues sometimes for quick feast."
Mathura Vilas,Pritesh Mohanty,24 November 2018,2,"Service - Extremely Poor 1*
Food - Average 2*
Ambience- Average 2*
Overall not a good experience. We ordered for North Indian thali, had to wait pretty long for it to come. Finally arrived, now to make it worse, If we ordered for some more they took 20 mins or more to get the item. They are so slow in serving, you will loose interest in your food. Welcome drink came after we finished having the starters, such is their promptness."
Mathura Vilas,Yogesh,24 November 2018,1,"What‚Äôs the point of taking Zomato Gold when there are so many restrictions on what is eligible. Look at the terms and conditions - they are so restrictive. The main speciality of the Mathura Vilas, ie Thali is not eligible for Zomato Gold. Coverage of Zomato Gold needs to drastically improve. No point in having Zomato Gold otherwise"
Mathura Vilas,Avijnath G,23 November 2018,1,"Apparently on holidays,half their staff too goes on a holiday.
The service was horrible, took them 10 minutes to clean our table and another 10 minutes to serve us water.
If this wasn't frustrating enough, they took 30 minutes more to get us undercooked food and some of the dishes in the thali were cold."
Mathura Vilas,Manidhar_pjr,21 November 2018,4,"Mathura vilas.....The food really justifies the name....

Food: üåüüåüüåüüåü

The typical vegetarian restaurant serves pretty good Thalis. These unlimited Thalis are served at Lunch and dinner. There are wide variety of curries both in the south indian and north indian Thalis. They should have included Puri's in the north indian Thali as well. The expectation is reached as they served this food in a banana leaf.

Ambience: üåüüåüüåü

The ambience of the restaurant is good can't say great but it's good.

Service: üåüüåüüåüüåü

The service was extremely good. They staff were very prompt and attentive. The wait time for the food is less.

On the whole a must visit restaurant for a hungry vegetarian."
Mathura Vilas,Divya,19 November 2018,1,Pathetic place! We had ordered for non spicy food but what they served us was tasteless spicy food. Also when we wanted to order for dessert they said everything in the dessert menu got over by lunch and hence there is nothing left for dinner.
Mathura Vilas,Hitesh Dutt,18 November 2018,1,"Went there @ around 10:45pm, was really hungry.
Had heard a lot about this place.

Food was not good at all, roti‚Äôs (tandoori) could easily be confused with papad, both were so thin and cold.

Sabzi was cold and seems like they didn‚Äôt care about customer.

Even at that time when we were the only table operating there was so much delay for someone to attend our table.

Not visiting this place ever again."
Mathura Vilas,Payal Khullar,18 November 2018,3,"I quite like the sumptuous North Indian and South Indian vegetarian thalis at this place. Served hot. Reasonably priced. Not too fond of ala carte here, though I must add it is still better than a lot of places. The ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for Sunday lunch with family."
Mathura Vilas,Shankar Bishnu Satapathy,08 November 2018,2,"North Indian thali was okay. We ordered paneer butter masala categorically saying don't use onion and garlic. The concern person said, he will serve. However, they still used both the ingredients."
Mathura Vilas,Piyali & Rahul Sarkar,04 November 2018,1,"Dont get fooled by seeing their advertisements, where they show lavish South Indian thali served on banana leaf. We went there in search of authentic south cusine, but returned disappointed. They didn't have any kind of thali at dinner and serve only north indian ala carte. We ordered some soup and starters which was okay. Then we ordered besibelebhat and curd rice, both were pathetic.They have a very confused theme. Don't waste your time or spoil your mood."
Mathura Vilas,Neelamraju Srikanth,03 November 2018,5,"Absolutely delicious food! Telugu lo cheppalante - Kammaga undi!!! After several years I have found a South Indian thali in Hyderabad that is a perfect blend of taste and spices. Surprisingly every dish is tasty. It‚Äôs very rare that restaurants dare to include Karela/bitter gourd in their Thali. I should admire the expertise of the chef who included this fry by mixing it with podi. The brinjal curry/ Bagaira baingan is exceptional. I should mention the choice of the tender and tiny brinjals used in this curry. Aloo Bajji, pulihare, Anna paravannam/pongal, puri, papad, tomato curry with hot white rice made me get sleep right after the lunch. I give 5 out of 5, to the awesome chefs who can be an example to other restaurants, by keeping a simple menu and still impress the food lovers even without lot of spices/ghee/oil."
Mathura Vilas,Vijay,27 October 2018,1,"Worst service and behaviour.
We ordered schezwan noodles. We were served spoiled ones from the morning. It smelled stale, sticky to touch and yak in taste. Worst experience. Asked the waiter to taste a spoon so that he will come to know the pathetic taste. He tasted and took away calmly .
Though I just had one spoon of it and returned back still they charged for it.
We spoke to the short fat manager for the charge levied on the spoiled food served which we didn't even have. He spoke very carelessly and extremely rudely.
Will never ever visit this again.
Strongly not recommended."
Mathura Vilas,Pooja Singh,23 October 2018,4,"Had Navratri thali here which was very tasty. Had a very basic taste and was totally abiding to the food eaten in fasting.
Place is nice and small. Tends to become a little congested sometimes.
The only drawback is that this place is a little overpriced. Navratri thaali was for rs. 300 and other items are also a little expensive."
Mathura Vilas,Simran Bhat,20 October 2018,1,I ordered veg. Thali..which was just nt up to the mark. The fud seemed stale with out any taste. We just threw it. I won't recommend it to anyone
Mathura Vilas,Abhishek Shukla,19 October 2018,5,"Everything a veg foodie crave for (though I am not vegetarian). Form delicious food to amazing Mathura lassi. Though we ordered a-la-carte and enjoyed every dish gracefully, seeing the thali at a nearby table looked even more tempting. I don't much remember what we ordered as there were lots of dishes but every dish was a great experience. And do not forget to order Lassi. Service was also great!

Must-Have: Lassi
Ambiance: Quite good
Service: Polite and Quick

I will be visiting there to have Thali next time."
Mathura Vilas,Ekta Bhatia,18 October 2018,2,"this was our first visit to mathura villas. we had visited this place on the last day of navratri for dinner. they only had special navratri thali in their menu for thali so we decided to go with it. we were utterly disappointed with the food:
1) the thali was filled with sambar, green chutney and sweet chutney, 1 peas corn gravy, 1 alloo gravy, mixture, navratan kurma and dry banana veggie, sour curd, samudana vada, samudana khichadi, payasam, fruit salad

2) there was no dal, no kadi, or any orther sabji/gravy in the thali. except for the kurma and corn-peas sabji nothing was appetizing enough

3) welcome drink like chaas/jaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served. on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us

4) only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali. again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali. only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include.

5) they only had plain rice for the thali

overall there was absolutely nothing ""special"" about the so-called ""special navratri"" thali !"
Mathura Vilas,Kamlesh Murudkar,18 October 2018,3,"Disappointed with their so called special Navaratri thali festival .. they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali, they told that they have only special Navaratri thali.. we decided to order two of them..
Nothing special in this one.. by Navaratri thali you would expect kadhi, khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali (utappam, sambar, payasam, kela sabji, mixture from South and tandoor roti, puri, corn n peas sabji, tikki from north) and small mixed fruits salad, green chutney, sweet chutney, plain curd.. they had just plain steam rice ..

They missed serving us welcome drink of chaas/lassi

Overall, disappointed for the price paid and options received."
Mathura Vilas,Shrish Deshpande,18 October 2018,3,"Fine place! Good food!
Bit overpriced to the quality they serve but that seems ok.
Hospitable staff, atleast hygienic dining area and good food that's the take away."
Mathura Vilas,Parakh Khandelwal,16 October 2018,5,Nice place..good ambiance..super friendly and helpful staff. Nilok das is the best staff among all..he will understand your needs and suggest food accordingly.
Mathura Vilas,Prashant Pathak,16 October 2018,4,"Visitied last Sunday for Dinner, order Badami Paneer and Tandoori Mushroom. Both were superb. First time tried Tandoori item of Mushroom and it turns so delicious must try. Also they provide banana lassi as a compliment drink."
Mathura Vilas,Harry N,16 October 2018,3,"We visited this place many times. Not so crowded.
Good ambience. Their thalis are good and a value for money.
Their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price(esp platters and other starters).
Their service is very slow and you need to be patient.
I would rate this restaurant 3.5"
Mathura Vilas,Bhaskar Rao,14 October 2018,3,"Visited for some Navratri special thali...
Taste was good but can be better.. Can be made more interesting with suprise and authentic .. cuisine's..."
Mathura Vilas,Gireesh.sharma7,14 October 2018,5,"Enjoyed a lovely lunch with a friend first time visited the place good food ambience is very nice and a very curtious staff.
Tried the Indian and Chinese items for starters and main course must visit for a good vegetarian meal prices are also pretty reasonable overall 5 star rating for this place."
Mathura Vilas,SUBRATO DAS,13 October 2018,5,"This is the best veg restaurant in terms of food, neatness and service at Gachibowli region. People are very polite while taking orders or serving. Loved it! üôèüôÇ"
Mathura Vilas,Ruby Ganta,12 October 2018,5,"I'm a pure non vegetarian, but this place became an exception after I first went there. They serve fresh, hygienic, tasty and flavourful food. They also serve warm ghee with each meal (unlimited).

You should try this place. It will change your perceptions on veg food!"
Mathura Vilas,Rahul Ratnawat,12 October 2018,4,"Awesome food.Good for Veg food lovers.They serve both thali and ala carte food.

We ordered Manchow soup , tomato soup , Tandoori mushrooms and Tandoori Aloo in starters.

Mushrooms i must say was spicy but too good. Almost melted in mouth. Aloo was also good.

Ambiance was ok ok.Service can be improved.

Overall very good restaurant for Vegetarians."
Mathura Vilas,Shikha Jain,11 October 2018,5,"Very happy with service provided by Nilak das.... happy go Lucky person...
Will visit just for his service and awsam food served by him i am happy with all"
Mathura Vilas,Rishabh Upadhyay,11 October 2018,4,Decent place with good ambience. A bit overpriced and service is a little slow.Quality of food is good. And the staff is well spoken. A decent family restraunt.
Mathura Vilas,Aishwarya Madan,01 October 2018,3,"Mathura Vilas is renowned for it's specialities but this time we tried to offer Chinese food at the restaurant. We ordered a veg noodles and manchurian with gravy.
The taste came out to be just fine. I wasn't very happy with the manchurian which lacked in veggies."
Mathura Vilas,Amrita Jaiswal,01 October 2018,4,Good place for family. Good service especially by Nilak Dasps ..nice food...in prime location... And very friendly staff.... Nice ambience with parking space
Mathura Vilas,Ritwik Mallik,30 September 2018,5,"Great food, very hygienic and clean. Recommended for vegetarians. I will suggest you try the Tandoori Mushroom. Thank you Bhagirathi Jena and team for the awesome service."
Mathura Vilas,Rupasri Guruprasad,29 September 2018,2,"The cost of the food was 200, but the quantity of rice packed was more but the gravies very less for a meal.The paneer gravy was missing ,curd very sour.Definiltely not worth for the money."
Mathura Vilas,Teja Dandigunta,26 September 2018,4,"Went here for dinner with family to try their notorious south indian thali, only to know that it is served only in the afternoon lunch, greatly disappointed and order north indian thali as there is no other go, and one corn fried rice.
To our delight, north indian thali was awesome, enjoyed every dish present in it, roti, channa curry, paneer, bhendi, and a gobi starter, each one of it delicious. Unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries. Sweet was very different and scrumptious.
Corn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali.
Definitely try this pure veg restaurant, when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes.
It was deserted on the day we have been here, not sure of the reason for less crowd. Ambiance is also great, service is reasonable and price is also affordable when compared other restaurants."
Mathura Vilas,Roshni Aftab,21 September 2018,4,"It was Ganesh Chaturthi and we decided to try something veg special . Having heard so many good reviews about this place , I insisted on going here.

With a pretty decent ambience , this place is very easy to locate . The staff is courteous. We order the special thali which they were serving that day. It was a combination of both North Indian and South Indian thalis . Believe me, the quantity is so much and it is unlimited.

There were around 4-5 curries out of which there was paneer, potato , cauliflower and 2 more . There were 2-3 sweet dishes including kurbani ka meetha. There was daal, sambar, curd and papad. All these were served with rice and poori and lachha paratha. There was also buttermilk as a complimentary drink.

The cost of the thali was 300 plus taxes so it costed around 330 per thali.

For all those non vegetarian buffs like me , u will love this place if you like to experiment with vegetarian options too sometimes . And my vegetarian friends, u will love this place. So just get going and have a foodilicious experience.!"
Mathura Vilas,Tarun Singh,19 September 2018,1,"Bad experience, first they denied zomato gold benefits by stating ""today is 15th aug"" so no offers. To be honest food was even more bad, paneer gravy was so watery n tasteless. Not recommended at all.............................."
Mathura Vilas,Ramachandra Upadhya,19 September 2018,4,"Great Ambience
Good Service
Good Food
Next visit for sure to try other varieties
Sweet we had ordered was good and Rotis and Sabzi was also nice and tasty"
Mathura Vilas,Shraddha Singh,19 September 2018,3,"We visited this place during a weekend so it was jam-packed and a tad bit noisy!
However, the service was polite and prompt. We ordered Schezwan Noodles and Manchurian using Zomato Gold.
The food was fine overall. Nothing extraordinary. The noodles were a little too spicy."
Mathura Vilas,Kanika Gautam,17 September 2018,5,We had south indian meal here... food was amazing. Loved drumstick n tomato curry. Staff is very polite in dealing... banana served with the meal is a bingo... will try north indian thali too and other cuisines as well
Gal Punjab Di,Mitali Agrawal,24 May 2019,4,"Food is good in taste. Specially the rotis are very soft and crispy. Kadhai paneer was okay, as it was not really a Kadhai paneer basically a paneer curry.
Service is quick. Overall a value for money."
Gal Punjab Di,Sarvani Upadrasta,24 May 2019,3,"Food tastes good..We had hara bara kabaab, aachar paneer tikka in starters..Starters are okk ..Not so great. In main course we had paneer lababdar and veg angara...Veg angara is delicious...Must try dish. .Patiala lassi is not up to the mark....Overall food is okkk....But service ia very bad....Management should concentrate on service as well..."
Gal Punjab Di,Vijayita Gumber,23 May 2019,4,"Cool Interior, Service was bit slow, Being a punjabi loved their punjabi playlist and punjabi food

Food - Dahi kabab were amazing served with mint chutney and spicy onions - 4.5/5
Garlic naan, Paneer do pyaza was usual -3/5"
Gal Punjab Di,Smrati Saxena,23 May 2019,4,"I've been to place many times. really nice food. high on price side but that is okay because they serve a good north indian food
would recommend tandoori momos from this place"
Gal Punjab Di,Prasun Gokhlani,16 May 2019,4,If you love butter chicken you can't miss out on this place. Butter chicken and naan and you'll be satisfied. Nothing more that's needed. Brings in the true Punjab to Hyderabad
Gal Punjab Di,Sneha Battula,14 May 2019,4,"Definitely worth a try if you're looking for some lip smacking North Indian Food.

Must try: Kadai Paneer, Garlic Naan, Shikari Murgh, Dum Ke Aloo, and Chicken Nachos.

Patiala Lassi is a must try as well but I wasn't too happy about it cause it didn't have much authenticity to it. It sure would be a game changer if they brought in some changes to it."
Gal Punjab Di,Nikunj Keshav,11 May 2019,4,"I went to this place for a lunch with my friend. We were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. Yeah! We were actually hungry. I liked the place - decoration was awesome! Cool interior. We ordered Veg Machaow Soup, Masala Papad, butter naan, Paneer Massallam and masala cold drinks. Please do note they give only Masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. We liked the food, taste was good. But the cold drink was tasteless - I guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. Ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. But service could have been good and fast.

Food - 4/5
Ambiance - 5/5
Service - 4/5

Overall - 4.5/5

Thanks for the hospitality though!"
Gal Punjab Di,Amit Goyal,09 May 2019,5,"Good ambience. Amazing food. 'Gol Gol Gaulloti' and Dal Makhani are must try items.
Good place!
Good ambience. Amazing food. 'Gol Gol Gaulloti' and Dal Makhani are must try items.
Good place!"
Gal Punjab Di,Ayush,05 May 2019,3,"Love the food here.. but not today :/
Dahi ke kabab - most Favourite - not today.. small kebab no dahi..
Dhabe di daal - big ginger chuncks
Tandoori roti - not cooked

Service on slower end.. Wish ordered food on swiggy than coming down.. its better when delivered ..

Had food but not enjoyed... Please keep the taste and service top notch.. wish you good luck"
Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Acharya,05 May 2019,2,"We had ordered the Spicy Mutter paratha (2/5) and the Mooli paratha (3/5). The parathas were thick and there was no butter on them. It comes with a drink(3/5) and dal makhani(3/5). Now I am not a regular paratha eater but occasionally i love my aloo, gobi and mooli ke parathe. I have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed. From the looks of the paratha, i am sorry to say this, but it didn't look very punjabi. Punjabis know their paratha well and wouldn't compromise on it. Cheers!"
Gal Punjab Di,SUMANTA CHATTERJEE,01 May 2019,2,"We visited this place during weekdays. This place is at prime location , easily accessible and has good ambience. We ordered tandoori and lasooni Tikka. Both of them were under cooked and were not worth it . Main course was not good either. Servings were taking lot of time to complete."
Gal Punjab Di,Sourabh Maity,01 May 2019,1,"We a bunch of friends went for a holiday dinner. Ordered tandoori murg, lasuni murgh tikka. Both the dishes were under cooked. Masala was not cooked at all. Had to throw away."
Gal Punjab Di,Manas Gangishetti,01 May 2019,1,Worst dal khichdi ever very less quantity. Expected a very good taste and quantity. Just pathetic service restaurant should check before serving the food. If you are going to maintain such poor quality it is not going to work for you
Gal Punjab Di,Pragati Pathak(No Fake Followers Please),26 April 2019,4,"good ambience.
Tried Manchow soup,roti,dal makhani,raita.
all were very good in taste .
I tried thali once that was also good and enough for one person."
Gal Punjab Di,Yash Sheth,20 April 2019,3,"I visited this place with my friend. It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli's Indiranagar, vinayak nagar.

Upon entering, you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant, which it is. The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.

Then comes the interaction with the staff. They are quite friendly and hard working too. They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark.

Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates. I really liked the way they split between veg and non-veg food.

We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab. It was good. But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi. But that was an anti climax of sorts. They used essence for the lassi. I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top. That will surely be a game changer.

Overall... it was a mixed experience and hence 3/5."
Gal Punjab Di,Aparnakarra291,19 April 2019,5,Food was simply Superb.Punjabi food was very delicious and also if we go to restaurant service was also really Good.Ambience is also very nice.and the restaurant was very peaceful to sit and enjoy Food
Gal Punjab Di,PRINCE GUPTA,12 April 2019,5,"Good ambiance and song playlist üòÄ, excellent place for deshi food lovers. I tried non-veg and it was really tasty.must try #murgh_mussalam."
Gal Punjab Di,Pragya V,11 April 2019,4,"When you are looking for some lip smacking North Indian food, Gal Punjab Di is the answer.
I have tried a lot of things here and my personal favorites are:

Salads: Chana Chaat
Starter: Dahi ke Kebabs
Jwalamukhi Tikka
Achari paneer tikka
Main Course: paneer mussalam
Beverages: patiyala lassi and shikanji

Taste: 4/5
Portion: 4/5
Quality: 4.5/5

A decent place to dine in with family and friends."
Gal Punjab Di,Vidul Mathur,07 April 2019,4,"Good place to have a good north indian meal. They have many options and the food tastes really good. We ordered masala papad, dal makhni and paneer lababdar along with some breads. The service was not so quick and we had to wait our fair share to get our food. Paneer lababdar was very tasty and so was the dal makhni.

Paneer lababdar - 4.8/5
Dal Makhni - 4.4/5
Ambience - 3/5
Overall - 4/5"
Gal Punjab Di,Rita Singh,06 April 2019,4,"pretty ambiance and comfortable seating. AC was not functioning properly so it was lil uncomfortable otherwise everything was fine.
we opted for 599 unlimited menu. Gosh it has like so many items that you will get confused what to order. Main course was great, the butter chicken and mutton were cooked properly and tasted really amazing. However, the chicken starters were lil salty.

Service needs a lot of improvement. Service is really slow, but then the staff is really courteous.
Should really come back to this place to try some more dishes from the menu as I'm sure they will be great."
Gal Punjab Di,Mayank Murali,30 March 2019,4,"I guess one of the decent Punjabi restaurants in Gachibowli.
Punjabi Murg Palang Todh is a must try with Amritsari lassi. The service and ambience is decent as well."
Gal Punjab Di,Manasi Puranik,30 March 2019,1,"We ordered Butter chicken, paneer makhani, dal makhani and mango lassi. The gravies had no distinctive flavor. They were overtly sweet and tasted nothing like the original dishes. The dal makhani was tolerable (but not good). Since it's mango season, expected the mango lassi to be made of fresh ingredients (our fault for not checking). Expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews."
Gal Punjab Di,Anshuman Sahu,24 March 2019,3,"Food is good but hygiene can be improved a lot. Saw cockroaches moving around the restaurant.
Service takes longer than expected. A little expensive considering the bland ambience and service."
Gal Punjab Di,Sumedha Rani,17 March 2019,5,Amazing food. We had both veg and non veg food and both were pretty tasty. Very creatively done interior. The ambience reminds you of North Indian dhabas. Very beautiful place. The cutlery used looks cool too.
Gal Punjab Di,Leher Sadhnani,14 March 2019,3,"‚ÄùNai, They don‚Äôt have any punjabi Gal‚Äô

First things first, really not happy with their service. Two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was Washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers.

So finally we got our order after 20-25 min of wait. The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. Don‚Äôt know how they served it. So we ordered Boneless Murg, i guess it was Murg Musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.

Overall one time try stop."
Gal Punjab Di,Praveen Mokkapati,12 March 2019,4,"Food tastes great for a quaint little place snuck in inner lanes of Gachibowli! The place is lively with Punjabi music and the friendly staff.

As vegans that eat food with little oil and spice, three of us had a sumptuous meal that comprised of Tandoori Aloo and Kebab as starters. The initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef didn't comply with our little/no spice request. Our order of Aloo Parantha and Veg Kolhapuri came as requested, however the Ajwain Laccha Parantha and Roti came laced with butter/ghee. The bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested. Aloo Parantha Combo came along with raita and chole. We requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole, and the staff gladly obliged.

Barring the few delays due to non-compliance of our requests, we found the food to be delightful, tasty and filling for a weekday dinner. The shikanji was great too! The staff are courteous, but definitely could do well with internal communication with the chef(s) to ensure requests are fulfilled. Go for it!"
Gal Punjab Di,Manisha Panda,11 March 2019,5,"This is a go-to place for people staying in and around gachibowli. Finger licking Punjabi food. Even a simple dal and roti tastes amazing here.
The lassi is the best outta everything. Very filling and taste satiating food.
Great ambience with Punjabi music on and the staff is very courteous as well.
You can have absolutely anything here and it would turn out to be good.
Love this place ü§ü"
Gal Punjab Di,Pratap,04 March 2019,2,"Ordered Non Veg Mini Thali through Swiggy. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.
It had Dal Makhani, Chicken Curry, Raita, Rice and Tandoori Roti, Dal Makhani was good and rest all items were just average. Tandoori rotis were hard, didn't like it.
Chicken curry was a big disappointment though, tasted bland.
Taste: 2/5
Quantity : 2/5"
Gal Punjab Di,Foodie On Wheels...,03 March 2019,5,"We tried

Paneer patiala - 5/5
Kadi pakodi - 4/5 still really good

All rotis were also good.

Methi Missi roti
Ajwaini laccha paratha
Butter naan
Jeera rice"
Gal Punjab Di,Jay Mehta,23 February 2019,4,"Have ordered from gal punjab di few times now- have tried dal makhani, paneer tikka, jwalamukhi series, veg dildara...alll of which very tasty.. this time ordered veg nizam handi in white gravy and mushroom manchurian.

Nizami handi was very rich, heavy but very tasty. It could have more balanced mix of vegetables and cream gravy. dont go by the photo, taste was good.

Mushroom manchurian is something i have never had before, tasted like manchurian. Personally still prefer good ol manchurian. Can definitively try if you have not eaten before..bit meaty in taste!

While review is on zomato, swiggy delivery was amazing..hot hot food right from restaurant kitchen!"
Gal Punjab Di,Niharika Nayak,22 February 2019,4,"If you are looking for Punjabi food then this restaurant deserves to be in your list.
The place was small but with a nice ambience nice place for dinner.
Ordered-
For starters: NRI Nanja 4/5
It's a form of desi pizza kind, good combination of tastes and something innovative.

For main course: Aloo onion paratha, amritsari kulcha and judwa paneer. 4/5
One plate of paratha/kulcha is enough for one person the side serving are also good in taste. Judwa paneer was also good.

Last but not the least the patiyala lassi, this is something one should try for sure if u r a lassi lover.
Overall had a good experience. Would visit again soon."
Gal Punjab Di,Food Junkie,19 February 2019,4,"I'll be rating it as 3.5 stars than 4 stars. This place got good ambience and interior design. The service is good and even the starters are nice. The only place that it fails to impress is the main course, no matter which chicken curry u order they all taste similar with slight change in the level of spice composition."
Gal Punjab Di,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 February 2019,4,Good food combinations and taste. Decent service. However the location of the restaurant could have been better. The quantity is relatively less for the price.
Gal Punjab Di,Dazz,04 February 2019,4,"Have been to this place on sunday. The starters Jawalamukhi tikka and chilly paneer was very delicious and paneer was so soft that it jst melted in mouth. In Main course paneer lababdar tasted little sweet and lacha partha was not worth. Anyways jeera rice and dal tadka was like authentic punjabi taste.
Ambience was good but it was too noisy.
Overall the experience was great."
Gal Punjab Di,Sachin,03 February 2019,1,"Ordered kamaal ka murg ( angara) , no value for money, the taste was that of uncooked masala with no trace of oil . Did not seem to be cooked at all .. the chicken was coated in curry.. üëéüèº"
Gal Punjab Di,Ankit Singla,02 February 2019,3,"not too good.. but OkOk. have better option nearby. need better option for punjabi food...
world seems really small everywhere you get punjabi food
#punjabi #stereotypicalfood #boring"
Gal Punjab Di,Ankita Bhardwaj Singh,31 January 2019,3,"Finally! Found something in hyderabad that tastes like north indian food. Tried the chilli chicken and thankfully it came without curry leaves. Also ordered roomali roti which was quite large in size.

Packaging: 4/5
Taste: 3.5/5
Quantity: 4/5

Will i order again: definitely!"
Gal Punjab Di,Rohit Reddy,31 January 2019,4,"I have been to this place twice till now. It is one of the good places for Punjabi food at gachibowli.
Among starters, I have tasted crispy corn and desi chicken nachos which were very good.
In the main course I have tasted, dhuni dum ke aloo and judwa paneer with butter naan. Dhuni dum ke aloo (stuffed aloo in rich gravy) was amazing but judwa paneer was just ok.
Overall. it was a good experience and I would rate this place as
Food - 4/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5"
Gal Punjab Di,Feroz Khan,26 January 2019,4,"A decent restaurant to pick for group of friends or office buddies. In menu they have two list of items, one are traditional and the others are un-traditional in each category starters/main course. If you are looking for something special go with un-traditional items (I tried this).
Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 3.8/5
Value for money - 4/5"
Gal Punjab Di,Kapil Kumar Avrp,24 January 2019,5,Great place. Been there more than a couple of times.. loved the food. Especially the lassi. Would definitely want to go again sometime. At least for the lassi :p
Gal Punjab Di,Sandeep Nahta,23 January 2019,2,Had their speciality - Makee di Roti - Sanson ka saag - no where close to what a real Saag.  Gazar ka halwa - OMG - chef never had gazar ka halwa in life - so pathetic.  Giving 2 rating as Starter was good - Paneer Szechwan.  Good ambience. Pricing also very decent. But overall taste of Punjab missing
Gal Punjab Di,Manorama Rao,20 January 2019,3,Small restaurant. Staff is professional. Food I would say was average .i had ordered naan Dhaba style chicken curry which was OK. Dal Makhani was awesome.i didn't like the gajar Ka halwa it was too dry.
Gal Punjab Di,Rajashree Roy,17 January 2019,2,"This place has a good ambience. However, the food is not up to the mark. The staff usually takes a lot of time to bring the food which is also not mouth-watering. Undoubtedly, Gal Punjab Di can improve."
Gal Punjab Di,Samta Phulli,13 January 2019,4,"Everything is Punjabi about this place. Be it food, music or ambience. The food would satisfy a palate craving the taste of the dhabas of Punjab. Makki ki roti te sarson ka saag and daal makhani are a must try!"
Gal Punjab Di,Shilpi Jain,10 January 2019,4,"Neither too big nor too small. Nice ambiance with Punjabi touch. Food is tasty and value for money apart from other places.

Service is little slow but manageable. Portions are quite big. There Dal makhni taste very good.
Go to place to have nice north Indian food."
Gal Punjab Di,Juveria Syed,08 January 2019,4,"We were 5 members and we went for lunch during our office hours. The moment I entered the restaurant I could get that desi and pure punjabi vibe. The interiors are such beautifully done.. Now coming to the service it was a bit slower. Here comes the protagonist of the story the FOOD nd it took away all the negatives the restaurant has, though it didn't have many. We ordered

STARTERS :-

Chicken keema nachos

Main Course :-

Shikari murgh.
Kadahi paneer.

Rice:-
Chicken biryani

Breads :-
Garlic naan
Butter roti
Plain roti(owing health issues)

Green salad
and Patiala lassi.

I was vehment about the fact that I wouldn't eat much due to bad health, but I couldn't resist my self bcoz the food was scrumptious. Evrything about it was so good.

Taste:-5/5
Appeal:-5/5
Quantity :5/5
service:-4/5 ( slow service)..

I recommend this place...

Gal Punjab Di,Va Hini,23 December 2018,3,Been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food. But my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit. Tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters. Little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish. Butter chicken which was ordered more didn't meet the taste buds. The chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer. The only dish which met our expectation was patiala Lassi. This drags me to this place again n again. Hope such things will be taken in near future.
Gal Punjab Di,Aditya Kumar,18 December 2018,3,"I regularly order from this place and also personally had visited this place.
This restaurant offers tasty food.
The service at the restaurant can be improved. The steward was not responsive.

I recently ordered veg thali Through delivery it had:
2 roti tandoori
Panner butter masala
Dal makhni
Raita
Rice
The food was good and tasty. In budget as well. The packing contained a plastic cover which was a bit hassle to remove.
Overall i liked it."
Gal Punjab Di,Atul Kumar Kushwaha,10 December 2018,4,Ordered paneer tikka and tastes good and delivered on time. But one thing was there is packaging. Packaging was not good as some of the tikkas got messed up. But overall taste was good.
Gal Punjab Di,Vivek Vardhan,03 December 2018,4,Went here on last friday. I didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. Food here was Awesome. I had ordered for Dahi Kebab and it was outstanding. The food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... Would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! Hope they keep continuing their good work.
Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Agarwal,30 November 2018,4,"When you love food and especially north Indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north.

I guess I finally seemed to have found it in Hyderabad.

Having been to the best Indian food joints like Grand Trunk, Norfest I guess the Butter Chicken here ranks at the top... Each one of them are good in their own regard though..

I landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through Zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance Zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

So probably I will not comment on Ambience and Service.. will update that later once I visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

In the last 20 days I would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that I don't get fixated to a place as I m more of a food explorer üôÇ.

The food has not disappointed me so far. Items tried so far
Punjabi Butter Chicken - Must Recommend , the best you will find in town
Veg Angara - good
Bhatti kaMurg - must try
Tandoori Momo - can be avoided
Dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
Murg Malai Kebab - good
Murg Tikka Masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. A person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
Dal Makhani - must try
Tandoori Murgh - must try

So that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks.. it's awesome do try if they deliver to ur place.

Overall 4
Ambience NA
Service NA
Food 5
Value for Money 5"
Gal Punjab Di,Arpit Chauhan,20 November 2018,4,"The crispy honey chilli potato is to die for, great in taste and cooked pefefectly.
Dal makhni taste's too good can relate with your home dal. Good in taste as well as quantity.
Reasonable prices.
Loved the place."
Gal Punjab Di,Bharath Kishore,19 November 2018,3,"i should say the ambience is excellent, we ordered chicken jwalamukhi tikka which was mouth watering and yummy but the butter chicken was a let down, i couldn‚Äôt find cheese in my chilly cheese naan. laccha paratha was ok.
shikanji is a mix of lemon and mint and people who like the combo will like that
Lassi is thick and as Punjabi as u like"
Gal Punjab Di,Sunny Bhasin,13 November 2018,4,"As they promise best butter chicken its not true butter chicken was not that creamy and smooth it was missing that hint. Ambience is good other things were good. Menu is quite funky, decor is punjabi theme.
They need to improve thier service."
Gal Punjab Di,Shiva Charan,08 November 2018,4,"I usually don't eat fish. But I tried Amritsari fish tikka here. Tasted good. And in main course, quantity of the curry served is less.
Overall experience - 4"
Gal Punjab Di,Priyanka Kumari,01 November 2018,1,We have ordered 2 non veg thalis for dinner. After an hour restaurant cancelled the delivery saying that they got more delivery and will not be able to deliver the order. Why are you accepting the delivery at first place. Previously the restaurant was small and service was awesome. But after expansion quality of food and service have detoriated.
Gal Punjab Di,Rajsi Gaikwad,01 November 2018,3,I set up high expectations for the place with respect to Punjabi food but.. the food was ok-ok the lassi was very nice. The price is reasonable.
Gal Punjab Di,Kundan Sahu,28 October 2018,4,"I have visited this place thrice. The place is located in a busiest place in Indira Nagar, Gachibowli where the crowd is usually more.
So, coming to the experience from the sum of these visits, I can surely recommend you to try this restaurant - as it gives a flavour of Punjab in their dishes.. Truly it goes with the name..

In terms of the below, my reviews goes:
Ambience - 5/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 5/5
Pocket friendly-  5/5
Place -  5/5
Quantity - 4/5

Overall, reducing some good points on Service part, as I feel service is bit slower, but I dont have any issues with the hospitality of the restaurant. They are very helpful, but if one thing to concentrate is definitely a fast service. Overall - Recommended to try out to these place. (y)"
Gal Punjab Di,Jayanth Majety,26 October 2018,5,"Food from this place is consistent.

Have ordered more than a couple of times from the place and was never disappointed.

Their Dal Makhni is to die for. Great in taste.

I've also tried their Mix parottas and they couldn't have done it any better.

They also have Shikanjis. Do try them.

They charge you for containers and the packing won't disappoint you.

Overall, a great experience.

I'm dining at this place soon."
Gal Punjab Di,Vedant Killa,23 October 2018,4,"A lazy Sunday afternoon, I was glad to have ordered from this restaurant. Perfect taste and great delivery.

I chose the North Indian Thali with the paneer option, they also served dal and raita. The rotis were soft and rice was good as well.

An ideal place to eat North Indian food with a very little pocket burn! üôÇ"
Gal Punjab Di,Kanika Garg,23 October 2018,1,"If you are looking for north Indian food
in Hyderabad then DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE. The waiters will not listen if food is late, Manager is totally uncivilized (Tries to peek into customers wallet and also talks rudely).  

We ordered :

1) Daal Makhani (Not even average)

2) Paneer (SERVERD WITH HAIR IN IT)

3) Biriyani (Below average)

4) Tandoori roti

5) Sweet lassi

After finishing the food, they will serve you finger bowl with food particles already present in it..!!

Gal Punjab Di,Unnatirocks95,21 October 2018,4,A decent punjabi food place. Awesome food and nice ambience. The packaging is superb!! Another must visit place for punjabi food lovers. Variety of options to try.
Gal Punjab Di,Sahithi K,14 October 2018,5,The best place to have Punjabi cuisine. Ordered Paneer Mussalam( Paneer stuffed masala curry)with cheese and garlic naan and was divine. Mushroom cheese starter and Honey potato chilli were mouth watering. Loved this place and the waiters were were very polite.
Gal Punjab Di,Duggu,12 October 2018,4,"Visited this place with couple of my friends today for lunch and their food is amazing.. Everything we ordered today was yum. The chicken was so soft and well marinated. Still drooling ü§§

We ordered the chicken jwalamukhi as a starter and were damn happy about the dish. In main course we had chicken palang tod which turnout to be another amazing dish. There gulab jamuns are yum as well.

Please do visit this place and taste their food.
Worth the money."

Gal Punjab Di,Priyanka Bariki,22 September 2018,4,I have been to this place 4-5 times and have different variety of dishes. Every dish was just perfect !!! And the prices are very reasonable compared to other Punjabi restaurants . Will definitely visit to try other dishes. Lassi here is MUST TRY :) Ambience is also really good
Gal Punjab Di,Srijit Menon,21 September 2018,3,"Food was good but the service was so slow that we did not enjoy much. The ambience is ok ,gives a dhaba feel. They have good options both veg and non veg. Veg food was tasty as well."
Gal Punjab Di,Payal Mohanty,19 September 2018,5,"You will enjoy north indian food especially Punjabi and you will leave this place with a 'wow' feeling.

I have been to this place for 3-4 times and everytime i just love this place. We have tried chicken lollypop, butter naan,punjabi chicken masala and spring roll.

Recently i have tried Tandoori chicken lollipop, yeah it sounds something different and u must try. The food was an absolute bliss along with the service of staff and ambience of the restaurant.

Lassi will satisfy your taste buds and cravings and leave you with a feeling of ecstasy.

In pic : Tandoori üêî lollipop and spring roll"
Gal Punjab Di,Karishma Bhatt,14 September 2018,5,"Amazing place. Amazing punjabi food . I ordered veg and non veg nachos, Mushroom fried rice, Stuffed kulcha, butter naan, garlic naan, shikari murg, daal makhni, and some more items but forgot their names. This is the second time i visited this place. And seriously speaking if you are a foodie then you must try this place. Both the time i visited this place, i ordered different items and i think whatever they have mentioned in their menu, i am gonna try all of them in my next visit. Staffs very much dedicated to the services. And of course that patiala lassi is a must try.

They have really amazing chicken lollipops and Dahi kababs. I've ordered quite a number of times from this place, however not visited the restaurant yet. Also try out on their Kadhai Chicken which was superb. Highly recommended if you're missing the Punjabi tadka here in Hyderabad.
You may follow me @simbas_sister on Instagram :)"

Gal Punjab Di,Rashmi Singh,24 August 2018,4,"What an amazing chicken butter masala and mushroom masala
Couldn't count of the calories that day.
They serve fulka roti also
And naan was also good
Try to order roti in a single go as they serve roti a bit slow"

Ambiance and works seems polite.."

The food was served in no time. Patiala Lassi (Big glass of Lassi) is a must try."
Gal Punjab Di,Mrutunjay Kinagi,21 August 2018,5,"Best paratha you can get in Hyderabad in Gachibowli !! It‚Äôs little expensive but 10/10 for food for value !!

Note : Don‚Äôt eat paratha if you are on diet !! üòÖ"
Gal Punjab Di,Abhishek Mandal,21 August 2018,3,It's a small place so gets crowded easily and noisy easily. Although the interior is interesting don't expect much of an ambiance. Service was prompt and their happy faces was refreshing after a long day. We just tried limited items and they were decent. Good to visit for a quick non-nonsense dinner.
Gal Punjab Di,Anuj Vashistha,18 August 2018,3,"avoid on week days! food's amazing on the weekends.. the workforce comprises of good happy faces, nice ambience! what else, mmm my fav - Chicken Tangdi Kebab üëå

*One awful thing! #No soft drinks.. only Lime Water(Sweet/Salty)"
Gal Punjab Di,Shrestha Gupta,18 August 2018,3,Average place with average food and ambience. They claim to be a Punjabi restaurant but not really Punjabi at core. The food is just ok with okayish ambience.
Gal Punjab Di,Johanne Rebello,05 August 2018,1,Decor n all great. Reviews bought me here with high expectations. The food was rancid and didn't look well prepared or freshly made. I ordered some cheese kofta. It was hard as a rock that kofta. Overall super weird punjabi food. Easy on the pocket but it's not something I would try again
Gal Punjab Di,Rajesh Kumar Yadav,04 August 2018,5,"Taste of food was very good. Specifically Palangtod chicken. One of best chicken curry that I ever eat. Since this was Panjabi restorant so don't expect Hyderabad Dum biryani but their biryani still very good I would say. On top of all Lassi was just awesome. Price is also very decent. So value for money.

Further improvement could be service time. But not a Big concern."
Gal Punjab Di,Akhil Mahajan,03 August 2018,5,"Craving for punjabi food in hyderabad? This one is the best one in hyderabad. They serve the authentic punjabi food and even they have their chef and cooks from punjab region. Their butter chicken, veg basket, lassi, makki roti are heavenly."

Gal Punjab Di,Kiran Thota,31 July 2018,4,"You don't need a silver fork to eat good food, Like wise a very hi-fi ambience is never good when one is hungry, especially for the Monday blues, perfect place for authentic punjabi/North Indian style veg and non veg to have, ordered paneer kebab, egg burji, punjabi butter chicken, lacha paratha, butter naan and rumali roti, perfectly cooked, tastes awesome, loved the food, service and ambience. will visit once again, keep doing the good work guys."
Gal Punjab Di,Vikash Kumar,31 July 2018,5,good
Gal Punjab Di,Siddhartha Goenka,30 July 2018,3,"This is a small Punjabi cuisine restaurant where we went for dinner. 'dahi ke kawab' was awesome. Also the paneer lababdar was delicious. We didn't like the rotis much. The naan was little thicker than it should be, and the lachha paratha was more oily. But overall we liked the food. The service is also good. The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.
Update:Went recently on Independence day. The paneery curry was just color and chilli powder. The paneer pieces were also very stiff. The rotis were also very rubbery."

Gal Punjab Di,Shahataaj Afzal,28 July 2018,5,"A Friday night hunger pang for some good Punjabi good, took me to Gachibowli....and straight to Gal Punjab Di.
Ambience : undoubtedly quirky & eye catching
Food : we had ordered Sava futiya Seekh kabab, Lassuni Chicken tikka & Bhatti da Murgh for starters... Since I had my kids along, had to keep in mind the spice levels. The tikkas were juicy & succulent & extremely delicious.
Stuffing ourselves with the starters, we settled for Dal Makhani with Missi Roti & lachcha parathas, for we couldn't eat in more.

The MENU CARD in itself is very quirky, it actually sparks up a thought of actually tasting those times....
* Sheela ki shashlik
* sava futiya seekh KABAB
*gat gat galaouti

& many more

The only negative for me was the mosquitoes... If that's taken care of properly.... It's all a thumbs up"

Hitech Bawarchi Food Zone,Srikanth Kuramana,20 November 2018,1,I ordered a chicken biryani at a cost 120rs which is an affordable price to have food for one person. But in this restaurant immediately when the order came I am really frustrated to see the quantity and quality. First talking about quantity it doesn't satisfy the hunger of atleast one person and then talking about quality it was not served hot . Readily packed food and looks like as it was not cooked fresh may be cooked atleast a day before I guess. I suggest my friends and colleagues never select this restaurant and I'll never order from this restaurant. I am even wondered how come this restaurant get 2.6 rating which is too high. Waste of money and time going to this restaurant and ordering from this restaurant.

I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani from one of the outlet of Hitech Bawarchi online. It was a single serve biryani containing a single large chicken piece. Biryani was fully loaded with dum and basmati rice was used. The quantity of biryani was more than sufficient for a single person. Along with biryani, salad, Salan and Raita was served. Biryani was packed in a good plastic container and carried in Hitech Bawarchi carry bag."

Hitech Bawarchi Food Zone,Krishanu Ganguli,27 July 2018,1,"Awful, in short!!!. Had gone to this place once for lunch. Had a terrible spicy tasteless biryani.The salan was just jal jira & pudina water. I guess they forgot we were having biryani and not pani puri. Explains the lack of customers."
Biryanis And More,Sravani,22 May 2019,4,Best place to have biryani in and around Gachibowli.Definitely recommendable. Almost fully crowded on weekends and weekdays both because of the quality and quantity.
Biryanis And More,Deepak Raj,15 May 2019,3,"Tried Bheemavaram mixed pulao and Green mirchi chicken pulao. Taste was ok,not that great. Service could have been way better. Bheemavaram pulao was good in meat to rice ration and tasted good.

Service--2/5

Quality and quantity --3/5

Price--3/5

Taste --3/5

Ambiance --2/5"
Biryanis And More,Debjit Hazra,29 April 2019,3,"The biryani here I found very delicious but needs more improvement in taste. All spices were blended and mixed well, but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste"
Biryanis And More,Gopal Bhargav,27 April 2019,4,"Me and my colleagues keep visiting this place every friday as it is very near to the office space. No much ambiance, simple restaurant. Booking is preferred on Friday's as it gets too much crowdy after 1pm. Staff isnt courteous at all. They always keep a sad face dont know why. Hopefully they are given some training to smile. Biryani taste is amazing. As I am vegetarian, i usually take Andhra Veg Biryani, Avakaya Biryani or Kaju Biryani. All of them are perfectly made. So all the rating is for only the taste, not for service and ambiance at all."
Biryanis And More,Rajeev Jakkani R,21 April 2019,3,"Been here twice. We have ordered Biryani‚Äôs. There were different varieties of biryanis served here. However, the taste was quite average. Since the name of the restaurant itself contains ‚ÄúBiryani‚Äù that too in City of Hyderabad the expectations were high. Being a lover of Biryani and comparing with other local Biryani Restaurants it missed that magic.
The portion of food served was also less."
Biryanis And More,Raghavendra,18 April 2019,4,"I have been ordering from this place for quite some time now. I have tried various types of veg biryanis available. My personal favourites are veg biryani, capsicum and mushroom biryani, mixed veg biryani.
Recently i ordered paneer tikka biryani which was really bad and i advice you to avoid ordering it.
Overall it's a good place to try out different kinds of biryanis"
Biryanis And More,Venky,05 April 2019,3,"Taste was good. But it took about an hour and half just for the starters to arrive. The Veg Keema biryani had a complete Coconut flavor, which we didn't particularly enjoy."
Biryanis And More,Vishu Varanasi,24 March 2019,1,"Having heard a lot about this place (specially their Triveni biryani) I came here once and ordered food 3-4 times)

The last time I purchased food here would actually be the last time I would eat from here.

This restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues.

To cut the long chase short, I had purchased 2 items. 1 paneer tikka biryani and Bhimwaram pulav (take aways)

In spite of telling them, both items were very spicy. My wife and I were struggling with the food. Now to top it, I found a flying insect (not a cockroach but something else with wings) that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani.

Alas, that was so repulsive that I left the food mid way and satiated my hunger with curd rice

I'm never going back to them"
Biryanis And More,Naveen Devireddy,14 March 2019,1,"Worst food ever,please don't believe the ratings & reviews mentioned below. Both veg and non veg were bad. 
utterly disappointed after have a team party over there based the these many +ve reviews..."
Biryanis And More,Priya Kishore Kotha,14 March 2019,4,The taste of biryani is excellent.and again i ordered butter naans it is also good taste.service also good. It is cost effective. But vegetarian curries are less varieties.
Biryanis And More,Pradeepmedikonda76,13 March 2019,3,It is low spicy and good food. Don't expect too much. Having a light dinner this place is good... Food is good.. but I am not recommending to anybody...
Biryanis And More,Moonis Ahmed,10 March 2019,4,"I cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but I would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs I ordered were simply one of the best I have ever had. 

I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab. Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.

Although a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome. 

Food - 5/5
Value for Money - 4/5"
Biryanis And More,Ajay Kumar,09 March 2019,1,The worst experience ever had. If you order a biryani you‚Äôll get an oil packet free in it. Hope you can get it! If you ask for a manager they says there is no manager.
Biryanis And More,Sandeep Sandy,09 March 2019,1,"The taste was not yet good,it's was too oil in biryani and while we are asking to the manager he said that it was ghee,no proper response from them."
Biryanis And More,Vamsi J Krishna,09 March 2019,1,"The worst food I ever had. I came with a team of 20, this seems to be my worst experience. Never an going to come. The chef don't speak, the managers don't know what is being served. Above all, biryani is cooked with oil enough to cook 4curries. What a pitiful condition. No feedbacks forms available."
Biryanis And More,Sindu Sid,09 March 2019,4,"' Biryani' the popular dish in Hyderabad, and yeah the most known dish throughout India.
Biryani's and more is one such place, where wide spread of biryani's are available. It has few outlet in Hyderabad, i visited to gachibowli outlet. It is located near biodiversity , beside care hospital gachibowli. This place is easily accessible, as it on main road. Its in ground floor of the building. Particular i wanted to this place, to taste some Biryani's, i have been here for dinner with group of friends.
Soon i went in, i was greeted by the friendly staff, and incredible aroma of biryani's from other diner's . We managed to snag our table.

Being settled down, we ordered few Mocktails
Mango lassi, as this is season of mango's‚ù§Ô∏è , ginger lemon, ginger cola, lemon soda, sparkling blue. Each of the Mocktails looked picturesque.

Mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all. Rest other Mocktails were good.

To start with dinner, we had soupsüëáüèª
Lemon coriander : this is a clear soup, along with some broccoli, carrot. Veggies gave us a delicious taste and it's a healthy soup to start with.
Chicken machow soup: fried noodles were added on top od chicken soup.

Appetizers:
We have order crispy veg, corn 65, apolo fish, tender chicken, bangla kodi, chilli prawns

Crispy veg: all vegetable (onions, potato, carrot) were deep fried.
It tasted average.
It can be better.

Corn 65: corn kernels were mixed with floor , and some ingredients, corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried, served with mayo.

Tender chicken, prawns are must try here.

Main course : avakya chicken biryani, afghani Biryani's , veg noodles

Veg noodles: vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture, sauces gives us a distinctive flavour. Noodles were soft, somehow i liked the noodles here.
Afghani chicken biryani: it is one exclusive Biryani here, on top of biryani' they serve omlet.

We have ordered some Indian bread, with tomato Cashew, and chicken curry.
Tomato curry with Cashew was best one i had , so in Hyderabad.

One cannot end dinner without desserts:
We have ordered junnu, jamun, kurbani ka meeta. I liked the jamun here, it was soft and tasted yummy.
I had a bad experience with junnu , everyone has a off night now and again, may b on that day junnu was bad."
Biryanis And More,Tummyful_hyd,08 March 2019,4,"Just the name of Biryani and Hyderabadis get hunger pangs! And so did we when we heard about Biryanis and more at Gachibowli for a food tasting session! Biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in USA as well, they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani! And after a a few outlets in Hyderabad the newest was opened in Gachibowli opposite to Nissan Showroom or opposite to Biodiversity complex! The place is very easy to locate! Though a small outlet but yet incredible! Simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating! The staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member Sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left! ‚úåüèª We being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about Biryanis...but to Our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing! We started off with the shakes, we were served the Mango Lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemon, Sparkling blue and Virgin Mojito! And all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola! üëåüèª Next we had the soups, we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup! They were good! And next came the starters and we had the Apollo fish, Chilli prawns, Tender chicken, Bangla Kodi, Corn 65, and Crispy veg! The best and the must have dish among them was the TENDER CHICKEN! The chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs! It was both Tender and crispy at the same time! Really enjoyed this dish! And the Bangla Kodi, a dish which was very new to us! It was something very unique tasty and spicy! It is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried! You definitely should try this if you haven't! Crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm! And corn 65 was amazing! Soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65! üòÇThe sea food was a little here and there.. Prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food! But they have covered it all up with their DELICIOUS BIRYANIS!üòç A complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well! We had the Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, Chicken Avakai Biryani and Chicken Afghani Biryani! Totally totally worth the money and just the Best ‚ù§ Ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from Horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome! It is said that Ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd, yoghurt or the raita to make it even! And then there was this Chicken Avakai Biryani, yet another mindblowing taste! Avakai means Mango..and this Biryani is made from the spices of Mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle! Never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of Mango pickle! üòçüòç Then came the Afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of Ulavacharu and Avakai when it comes to the spicy level! Really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top! Believe us if you're a Biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in Your list! I'm gonna go back again for the Biryani! ‚ù§ the other main course included Naan basket with Chicken tikka masala and Chicken chettinadu! As you must be knowing Chicken Chettinadu a popular dish from Tamil Nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty! And here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the Taste! Soo the main course here is the real stunner! Next we had the desserts...ever wished to be Ganesh Gaitonde? üòÇ You definitely do not want that life! But yes You can enjoy the same dessert which he just LOVES! The Kharvas also called as Junnu is an Indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow! We don't know how the actual taste of the Junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was Superb! üòç You ought to have this dessert to get that Gaitonde feels! Next in line were the Gulab Jamun and Qubani ka meetha, the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good! üëçüèª
Soo if You love to enjoy a variety in Biryani then Biryanis and more should be Your next stop! üòç You're going to love it"
Biryanis And More,Riz & Shanky,04 March 2019,4,"Follow our Instagram handle @whereinhyderabad!

The lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of Biodiversity, Gachibowli, right opposite to Nissan showroom. The place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant. The staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to Mr. Sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.

As soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.

Delicious appetizers:

Crispy Veg: A variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn‚Äôt new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!

Corn 65: It tasted absolutely delicious. Corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! Thoroughly recommended.

Bangla Kodi: Which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.

Chilli prawns: Spicy, stirred fried, It tasted awesome.

Tender chicken: The star of the appetizers. Brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. Highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.

Apollo fish: So it was a fish. Apart from that about the taste was okays‚Äôish.

Main Course:

Chettinad Chicken: Very Spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan.

Kolhapuri Chicken: Mild flavours, the taste was good!

Uluvacharu Chicken Biryani: This was the highlight of the dinner, unique taste and flavors, the restaurant lived up to the name of Biryani, Highly Recommended.

Avakai Chicken biryani: A novel kind of taste for me and I really liked it.

Afghani chicken Biryani: Mild flavor biryani topped with Egg-omelet, It tasted really good.

Desserts:

Qubani ka meetha, Junnu and Gulab Jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts. I earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part. Everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good Indian biryani Flavours.

Biryani and more, a new outlet in Gachibowli is fine-dine restaurant.
It has recently opened and serves varieties of biryani and other food dishes.
This restaurant is on the ground floor and can be easily spotted by the crowd passing by the road.
I‚Äôve been here for a dinner session.
The ambience of this place is quite good with bright lights all over the place.
It was a weekend and there was a pretty good amount of crowd at that time.
We started with mocktails.
They had many varieties of mocktails,out which we ordered the sparkling blue,ginger cola,mango lassi,ginger lemon and ginger mojito.
All the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink.
Almost all the mocktails had mint,lemon and ice which was refreshing!
The mango lassi was too sweet.
Then we were served with soups,
Veg lemon coriander soup
Chicken manchow soup
The veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli.
The chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodles,it tasted delicious.
We were then served with starters,
Apollo fish:
The fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it.
Tender chicken:
This was something very tasty,the chicken was soft,tender and with good amount of spice.
Bangla kodi:
It is one of the most popular dishes,it was crispy,light and was well presented with coriander garnish.
The chilli prawns:
The prawns were juicy,spicy and had great flavour.
Crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had.
They also were good but not that great.
Next we were served with main course:
They served us different types of curry‚Äôs with Indian breads.
The chicken chetinadu,its a spicy chicken curry which was too good.
The other curry‚Äôs were chicken tikka masala,tomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken.
The ulvacharu chicken,a chicken curry with horse gram soup was outstanding and finger licking good.

Biryanis:
We were then served biryani.
avakai chicken biryani
Afghani chicken biryani

Avakai chicken biryani is a authentic Andhra dish,it had a wonderful taste still haunting.
Afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryani,it had unique flavour.
It was served with egg omelet above the biryani .
We ended up our meal with deserts,
Qubani ka meetha,gulab jamun and junnu.
The deserts were not that great and had disappointed me.
Overall the restaurant has good biryani‚Äôs and I would suggest everyone to visit this place especially for avakai chicken biryani.

Biryanis And More,Indradipta Sardar,02 March 2019,4,Visited this place several times for team lunch as this restaurant is very near to my office. It is recommended you reach there early as during lunch time the restaurant will be packed with office people. Food quality and taste is very good. Service also upto the mark considering the rush.
Biryanis And More,Ankita Shilpa,13 February 2019,5,"One of the top 10 Biriyanis of Hyderabad tbh! I had once gone to this place with my colleagues for an office lunch, and since then this place has been my go to! This time I ordered CHICKEN TIKKA BIRIYANI because this is what I ate the last time and loved it. The packaging is standard and good, the quantity is enough for one person, with tender pieces of chicken and overall, too yumm! üòç Would love to repeat orders from this restaurant.. and it is also good to take your family and friends for a lunch there :)"
Biryanis And More,Kashif Syed,31 January 2019,4,"Biryanis and More at Hyderabad is a good food joint which gives you an option to order a lot many other food items apart from biryani. Biryani is must to have though i liked all of the food ordered.

Biryanis And More,Sudhindra87,25 January 2019,4,Food is very good and tasty.Ambience is good enough. Egg biryani and ulavavacharu biryani is superb.i think price is bit high.veg and egg starters are good enough.Bongu lo chicken is fantastic.
Biryanis And More,Nagendra Yerubandi,03 January 2019,5,I liked the flavors of Andhra in their cuisine. I ordered chicken tikka biriyani with tandoori chicken and coke. I liked biriyani which was plentiful. Nice customer service as they were always ready to serve. Good ambience and locality. I loved my experience at this restaurant in Gachibowli.
Biryanis And More,Vijay,30 December 2018,5,Delicious food good serving and chicken starters taste resionble prices and very good quality and quantity i prefer this resturent best for food
Biryanis And More,Lokesh Gudapati,30 December 2018,5,Biryani is soo tasty.and we loved ur service maintenance so nice. I satisfied my self with u and ur tasty Biryani. Definitely I will come again and again to njy ur service
Biryanis And More,Venkatesh Movva,30 December 2018,5,"Wonderful taste items, everyone must try different delishies. Must visit and eat and get very pleasure free feeling meal. Very very tasty and yummy"
Biryanis And More,Venkata Vikram Sai Idupulapati,30 December 2018,5,"We had such delicious dishes every time we went here. Spicy chicken statters, Mutton biryani, very good ambiance and much more. The staff was very kind."
Biryanis And More,Pradeep Koney,29 December 2018,5,Food is tasty. I am a fan of their fried rice rather than biryani. Have tried it multiple times. Ambience is good. Food will be served faster and waiting time is lesser too.
Biryanis And More,Praveen Kumar,27 December 2018,5,"Good place to dine with family and friends. They have great chefs, food was very tasty and service was also good. Especially all chicken items are good"
Biryanis And More,Prasanna,25 December 2018,2,Serving not upto the basic standards. Place smells wierd and costs not at all fair. Not a preferred place for vegetarians. Most of the items on the menu not available
Biryanis And More,RamChetan Polishetty,25 December 2018,3,"Food is good but service is not that good and charged price different from one in menu
Items are worth but not good courtesy and customer is not treated well"
Biryanis And More,Va Hini,23 December 2018,4,Visited this place for the first time. Tried gongura mutton biryani and Tuglaq biryani. Both the dishes tasted decent but they didn't justify the biryani tag line. Tuglaq biryani tasted more of Pulav and it nowhere can stand near biryani. The amount of meat given is not on par with the money you shed. Ambience is decent and the staff are quite courteous.
Biryanis And More,Agarrwal,15 December 2018,4,Biryani is good. Specially bamboo chicken is awesome! It just melts in your mouth! One star minus for not having most of the items mentioned in the menu.
Biryanis And More,Gnana Harish,30 November 2018,4,"Biryanis are good in taste and healthy. The below desserts are not worth the cost and the quality of desserts ( Khurbani ka meetha and gulab Jamun) is very poor. We have taken takeaway, so overall, the Biryanis are good in taste."
Biryanis And More,NayanNanda,25 November 2018,1,"Poor service and rally horrible customer service, specifically the person named Imran really mis behaves and don‚Äôt take the order properly and was kind of threatening. Food quality is also not up to mark and importantly the behaviour of staffs as mentioned by Imran is very bad ."
Biryanis And More,Priti,11 November 2018,4,"The ambience is ok kind but biryani is perfect. Tried the gongura Biryani, it was great. would like to try more dishes of them. Its cost effective."
Biryanis And More,Georgie,07 November 2018,5,Good food and service at a reasonable rate. Love this place for their garlic naan... So rich with garlic..üòõ will plan for more visits in the future.
Biryanis And More,Abhiram Gowrav Xtran,05 November 2018,4,"Fallback place/ safehouse.

Been here so many times in the past 6 months.

Taste, ambience, service - no problem. They talk about biryanis, but we mostly order curries and rotis. Generally table is available. The staff can recommend the dishes based on your liking.

Veg jaipuri, tikka masala, garlic naans are worth a try."
Biryanis And More,Sambhangi Sandeep,10 October 2018,4,"Good place/nice ambience.
The service was real slow, the Butter Naans were bad !!! That‚Äôs the only reason I rate em 4.

But loved their Chicken Tikka Masala and Veg Biryani.

Will come back soon."
Biryanis And More,Vicky Patnaik,04 October 2018,4,"I had visited this place recently on a week day .The place was a bit crowded but we got the table after waiting for few minutes .Ambience is not that good but food tastes really good we ordered a few chicken starters and biryani.It was worth the money.

Biryanis And More,Ayushmaan Kapu,02 October 2018,3,"Ambience : Normal proper dinning with lcd TV playing songs or cricket

Food : As the name says wide varieties of biryanis are there | If u are an authentic Hyderabadi dum biryani fan then better try other biryanis items except dum category |Kaju kheema rice biryani goes good

Service : 15min on an avg"
Biryanis And More,Kumar Sumit,01 October 2018,4,Biriyanis and more you were amazing to help me out with my foods during my Hyderabad stay. I liked the flavors of Andhra in their cuisine. I ordered chicken tikka biriyani with tandoori chicken and coke. I liked biriyani which was plentiful. Nice customer service as they were always ready to serve. Good ambience and locality. I loved my experience at this restaurant in Gachibowli.
Biryanis And More,Lavanya,23 September 2018,5,"The most comforting biryani that satisfied my taste buds is from Biryanis. With just the right amount of spices, Boneless chicken biryani served here is my go to food on any day. Bhimavaram mixed pulav is a must try!"
Biryanis And More,Adheeth Hundi,17 September 2018,5,"A great restaurant and a wonderful experience.
1. The ambiance is on the spot and attractive, with white and red combination. Spacious and have a separate waiting  space which is impressive.
2. Service is great, manager too. But, I think the presentation of food and table decoration can be a little improved, It could be more premium.
3. Food is AWESOME. I think it is the hyderabad's finest biriyani I have ever had, had panner biriyani, Awakai biriyani, couple of staters and Tomato soup which is really good.

overall, Its worth the cost and a pleasant place for family and friends."
Biryanis And More,Bhanu,15 September 2018,1,my order was changed
Biryanis And More,Venkatesh Medisetti,15 September 2018,3,Got nice food but packing not good. In this restaurant best food item is fry pice biryani is the best birani i never eat before. Please prepare food packaging neat
Biryanis And More,Sree Leela,09 September 2018,4,"Good food and a very crowded place on friday afternoon.Lemon coriander chicken and bamboo chichen are good in starters..Mutton dum biryani, green chilli kodi pulav are the best."
Biryanis And More,Manoj Lukon,08 September 2018,2,"I ordered Veg Manchuryia and Fried piece Chicken Biryani, Manchuryia wasn‚Äôt hot and taste was below avg , same with biryani too taste was below avg as name itself biryanis and more people will expect min taste and service was very poor every time I should remember them to bring water bottle , Manchuryia, Biryani and after that we should call them and ask to serve , it is very bad experience in my recent times ."
Biryanis And More,Krishna Teja,07 September 2018,4,Baby corn is not there in paneer and corn Biryani
Biryanis And More,Aditi Gupta,27 August 2018,4,"Ambiance(3/5):
The place is simple and sober, nothing fancy. 

Food (4/5): 
Chicken 65: It has strong garlicy and gingery aroma. Medium spicy, soft boneless starter. 
Paneer Tikka: Smoky soft paneer 
Ulvachuru Biryani: Yummy . Rice along with some red colored gravy gave it a nice juicy touch. However they used regular rice, we were expecting basmati rice. 

Moderately priced. ~800 for the above three dishes. 
Quick service and courteous staff."
Biryanis And More,Kulsum Begum,25 August 2018,2,"I ordered my lunch from this place and it was really disappointing experience for me. I had ordered garlic naan, chicken patiala, pepper chicken and chicken majestic.
Garlic naan was somewhat ok. But, chicken patiala was not at all as expected, it was somewhat sweet and with a different color and the taste was also not good.
Pepper chicken was over fried, which was giving a burnt taste.
Chicken majestic was also not that good. Thin strips of chicken being served which serves any justification to the name itself, neither by it's taste nor appearance.
My personal experience with Biryanis and more was not at all good."
Biryanis And More,Gaurav Gupta (GG),20 August 2018,2,"Restaurant must be preserving the old veggies. I ordered Veg Paneer Babycorn biryani. Babycorn was rotten completely, I felt pathetic after eating. Rest of the food was fine. This restaurant has wide variety of biryanis and makes it still a preferred place."
Biryanis And More,Ramesh Gariganti,15 August 2018,5,Good
Biryanis And More,Ram Raju.,15 August 2018,1,"I have came here for my lunch.
Items are in menu card only not in kitchen. What ever I have asked server saying not Available sir. Almost 5 items he said not there even some of them are from there special once.
So finally I have asked him to get what ever is there in the kitchen.
The disappointed lunch at biryans.

Biryanis And More,Manoj Gurrevala,13 August 2018,4,"Taste was good here and of course, ppl were waiting more than 1/2 hour to get the tables inside. As expected, yes restaurant will meet our expectations. Prices are okay and taste is quite good. But only thing is, need to wait for some time to get items.

Biryanis And More,Sajid Hussain,19 July 2018,4,"Been there for a team lunch.. Ordered Ulvacharu mutton biryani, Chicken pulao and Bamboo chicken
Ulvacharu mutton biryani (5stars) was the winner.. everyone in the team absolutely loved it.
Bamboo chicken (3 Stars) Although it was cooked in a Bamboo, it wasn't hot and the bamboo looked like it was already used earlier.. after complaining to the manager they served it again and then it was hot and nice.
Chicken pulao was good.
Staff is very polite!
Over all a good experience! Definitely 3.5 Stars and above"

Biryanis And More,Rabia Sultana,16 July 2018,2,"I visited the place with my colleagues. We were around 15 people. Though the ambience was good, and food tasted okay, it‚Äôs not worth the money. The real problem is that the place is quite congested in the first place. You will have to go quite early to avoid wait time. But that didn‚Äôt help us either. I was extremely disappointed with the service. We waited for almost like 1 hour for the food to arrive. By the time the veg food arrived (add on is that the soup came after starters were brought), our non-veg friends were having the main-course. The staff was not apologetic at all.

I would not prefer to have food here again.

Plus, you will find hell lot of flies around. All the time I was waving over my food üòï"

Diners Pavilion,Amith Katta,17 May 2019,5,A classy restaurant in Gachibowli area that serves super awesome Hyderabadi food at a very reasonal price. The waiters are polite and accommodate any special request you have as to how the food has to prepared
Diners Pavilion,Anirban Mukhopadhyay,15 May 2019,1,It is closed as of 14th May. It is not mentioned on Zomato. Please call before you visit this place. I wanted to take my parents to the place but they referred me to Mustang!!!
Diners Pavilion,Kishore Kumar Chitikesu,14 May 2019,5,"The taste was really good in non veg starters, In veg paneer starter was awesome and butter non are very soft and good.
Nice place to visit
Good staff and very polite"
Diners Pavilion,Payal Patra,11 May 2019,4,"Kalmi kebab and lemon coriander soup is an all time fav combo for me whenever I visit this place. The taste has been consistent over the time .
Staff is courteous and ambience is good , quiet place"
Diners Pavilion,Diptiman Purbey,06 May 2019,2,Ambience and food both was okish. We had taken buffet. Not much options and even the food options available were not much delicious. Not a place I would recommend.
Diners Pavilion,Rama Krishna Sameer,01 May 2019,1,Worst service. Worst staff. Worst food. Waste of every penny I spent here. They didn‚Äôt even apologise for the mistake they have done while billing.
Diners Pavilion,Sanchay Srivastava,20 April 2019,3,"Went for a lunch on a weekend. Ordered a biryani, in which I felt the rice to be slightly undercooked. The chicken do pyaza ordered had chicken pieces which were not mixed well with the gravy. Ambience is not same as what is seen in the photos. Staff is courteous but lacks experience in hospitality.
Could be much better!"
Diners Pavilion,Subhamani Nayak,19 April 2019,1,One of my worst dining experience ever. The staff took one and half hour to serve the main course and another half an hour to provide cutlery.Way to ruin my bday dinner with my parents with me actually leaving the restaurant empty stomach.
Diners Pavilion,Raj Yadav,17 April 2019,1,"I went to the Diners Pavilion, Gachibowli on April 14, 2019 at 8:15 PM to attend the birthday party of my friend's child's birthday. I asked security about valet parking and he said, yes there is valet parking, so I gave key to park my car. In fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and He never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.

With situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.

Really, I am very upset with this type of irresponsible behavior. I never faced such a kind of experience in my life."
Diners Pavilion,Nag Vamc,11 April 2019,3,"Been to this place very recently as one of my friend suggested me to try this out.Ambience wise it was decent,didn‚Äôt had much rush or was not that crowded ..nice place ..Food was good ,Had Crispy Corn,Bira and Corona üòâ Chicken Spicy Table which I liked it among all,Laila Biryani which I first heard and had in Pine and Dine and after that I am having that Biryani here..ended up with mockatil Dp special which was blend of Guava and Peach,It was good...Can try this place once"
Diners Pavilion,Ekta Bhatia,04 April 2019,4,"From what I have heard about this place is that, it is more popular for its spread in lunch buffet. But we decided that we'd debut this place for some drinks post-work and barged into this otherwise dessert place around 9:30 in the night. Not very crowded on a weekday, nice ambience, clean washrooms, wide options to choose for (drinks and food), decently priced and quick service - qualities we usually look for in any good restaurant! üòä

Oh and they have a thing with throwing a desi touch to their dishes, which I liked it!

We had 6 bottles of beer at INR 700

Food (don't remember the prices):
Chicken caesar salad
Chicken Peri Peri pizza
Chicken chipote skewers

Overall, loved my experience. Would definitely go again, perhaps to try their lunch buffet!"
Diners Pavilion,Kamlesh Murudkar,04 April 2019,4,"Visited this restaurant on a Wednesday night and it was empty with only one table occupied. Zomato gold confirmation was quick and we ordered a bucket of Budweiser which was offered at 700 (6pints). Ordered chicken peri peri pizza, chicken chipotle skewers and chicken ceaser salad. All three items were good and specially the pizza. They undoubtedly serve one of the best pizzas in town . Very soft thin crust and very tasty. 5 stars for their pizza

Chicken chipotle skewers were little chewy but tasted really good. Ceaser salad was very good too. Service by Aumit was appreciated

Would love to visit again for trying their other items in menu."
Diners Pavilion,Harsh Singh,01 April 2019,5,"It was random plan to visit this place and turned out to be great, we ordered chicken biryani boneless had some different name i forgot but taste is something i cant forget . Also we ordered paneer starter which was good too, loved the place though service was little slow but manageable."
Diners Pavilion,Jaswanth Chowdary,01 April 2019,3,It average restaurant while preferring to buffet. There will be no much varieties. But ambience wise it looks good. Nothing great here routine buffet system. Has to implement to new kind of varieties.
Diners Pavilion,Mimi,26 March 2019,5,"A calm fourth floor restaurant. Interior decoration is very pleasant. Ordered Mint Mojito, Kaju Rice, Murgh Palak. They accept Zomato gold for food. The foods were nice tasty. But price a little costlier according to the quantity they served, (especially the rice quantity). Mojito was truly expensive 199 per drink. Otherwise good place to visit for those who don't love noisy place like me."
Diners Pavilion,Sanjita Mandal,25 March 2019,5,"Ambience is average.
Food is awesome, although starters quantity served is less in comparison of price, but taste covers it's all.

Must visit place"
Diners Pavilion,Sohani Nanda,20 March 2019,4,This place is one of my favourites as it will always be empty..you can plan anytime and visit..they serve food a bit late to order accordingly..amount is very good. Meat balls soup is must have and nijami paneer is also very good.

Diners Pavilion,Suraj Soni,09 March 2019,5,"This was a visit to this place after a long time again,they literally surprised us this time. A lot of improvement in the service due to change in staff and management. Food quality was also quite improved. Ambience is as earlier a good one. Must visit again for sure soon!"
Diners Pavilion,Right Fooodies,06 March 2019,1,"Recently visited this place for team party, it didn't reach up to my expectations.

Food is just okay kind of nothing great because we ordered soup ( manchow and veg nizami, Chicken Biryani- was pathetic) and in desert section also they don't give much options.

Service is okay and friendly but you might find difficulty to get someone who attend you. If you are going to family and then you might like it."
Diners Pavilion,Deepak Rajana,05 March 2019,1,"The management here is greedy.
The problem came when we asked for bill. In the bill they added 10% service charges and GST.
We asked why again Service Charges when there is GST.
First, they denied and later reduced 10% Service Charge.
The online payment method took 15 min to verify the payment from waiter to owner.
One big suggestion is, please check your bill before payment. Why should we pay 10% extra to these greedy people.
I will never recommend this restaurant.
I also have both bills and GSTIN number with me."
Diners Pavilion,Alisha,28 February 2019,4,"This is an amazing place with a scrumptious food.. it looks so sophisticated and elegant in every corner.
Lovely ambience

Great food
Nice decor of course."
Diners Pavilion,Parijat Ray,28 February 2019,3,The ambience is really nice. The food items are a bit costly and I personally felt the portion sizes are less too. The food items are tasty.
Diners Pavilion,ANUDEEP REDDY Gouru,28 February 2019,4,The ambience of the place is classy and good. Was a pleasant experience. They have scope to introduce more variety in the items. Otherwise it is an excellent dining place.
Diners Pavilion,Shankarkumar21,04 February 2019,3,The food was not up to the mark. The Mexican dish had too much chilli and Mexican rice was like Indian veg fried rice. The Thai dish had strong flavours. Overall did not like the food.
Diners Pavilion,Vinay Vicky,30 January 2019,5,"i generally go to diner's pavilion for lunch  buffet &  celebrating  parties......

One of the best place to hangout with friends...near gachibowli...

Service & Staff : service was quick and staff did their best.

the music was so good! So, all in all, we had a very good experience...!!! keep it up ....."
Diners Pavilion,Sai Parithosh,27 January 2019,3,"The food is little expensive but unlocked gold benifits, so felt somewhat reasonable, tried chipotle chicken skewers and chicken bbq pizza , the pizza was great and liked it a lot, the service was very very slow, it took 40 mnts to serve my order"
Diners Pavilion,SAI ABHINAY BOMMAKANTI,20 January 2019,5,Great food .. never expected such a nice and spicy food in Gachibowli .. loved it ... place was pleasant to hangout with friends ... I recommend it strongly
Diners Pavilion,Rahul Yadav,01 January 2019,1,"Visited on December 23rd at 10 PM. Pathetic experience, chess balls served as cold. Second drink quantity is lesser than first one. First time disappointed from your service. Hope next time you will improve your services."
Diners Pavilion,Pooja Patimeedi,30 December 2018,2,"Went to this place recently, it didn't reach upto my expectations. Its not at all like the pictures they showed in this app.
Ambience was just okay. Its a small room with hardly 10 tables.
The staff didn't respond like they should ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Coming to the food it's not that great. There were no boneless chicken starters also the items are very limited üòí. The main course was also disappointing.
The funniest part is there were only 3 deserts which includes vanilla ice-cream üòÇ, gulab jamun n some kind of sweet. And the fruits tasted sour.
This is what I got after spending 550 on the buffet.
I would never recommend this place."
Diners Pavilion,Roshan Nair,29 December 2018,1,"Went for a team lunch to this place and it was a very bad experience. Food was tasteless and cold. Request to staff to get hot starters went unheard.

Only items good on the menu was chicken biryani and gulab jamun."
Diners Pavilion,Dileep Kumar,27 December 2018,4,"After thinking too much about which place to go for lunch, we have decided for Diners pavilion.

The ambience is decent with a friendly staff.

First time saw a restaurant serving egg in buffet. As of me it's first experience having egg for buffet. The taste of the food is superb.

Loved the egg starter and the welcome drink.

Cheers,
Dileep"
Diners Pavilion,Abhishek,26 December 2018,3,The place is know for its buffay but I tried only the Thai Red curry chicken with plain rice. The food was really nice but the service was a tad slow.
Diners Pavilion,Muskan Bhansali,08 December 2018,4,"Ambience- Good for a family dinner. Warm Mellow lights are soothing. Although they should have a music system and play selected songs instead of just plugging in the TV and playing a music channel. The advertisements and random songs kind of kill the ambience.
Food- Taste and quality is upto the mark. We ordered Pasta and Salad. We wanted some customizations in our order and the staff was happy to incorporate that.
Service and staff- Quick service and polite staff."
Diners Pavilion,Yaseen,23 November 2018,2,"We went on a Thursday night. Pretty empty except for one more table. The service was pathetic and every dish came in an average 30 mins after ordering, even the naan.
The food was ok and there are far better places around. The service killed the taste of the food.
Go at your own risk."
Diners Pavilion,Andra Praveen Chowdary,14 November 2018,5,Nice place for team lunch and dinner staters are tasty try the stuffed mushrooms & Tandi here Over all ambience and service is good thanks for everything
Diners Pavilion,Amitavp,05 November 2018,3,"Went with family on Saturday, Nov 3rd. Only one more table was occupied so was worried about the place. We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time. Food was okay not that great taste, the chicken wings were good though. Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time. Chicken quesadillas didn‚Äôt taste like a quesadilla. It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti. There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time."
Diners Pavilion,Sidharth Singal,31 October 2018,3,"3.5 Went here for dinner on Saturday night. Almost empty, only two other tables occupied. So were sceptical, anyways got seated. Inspite of this it took good 15 min anyone could attend us. The reason cited was heavy rush in the partner restaurant above!! Wiered.. however the food was served quickly. We had tomato shorba, veg pizza and crispy veg. All items were good, nothing wow to say about. Availed zomato gold. Overall ok experience, nothing compelling to visit again."
Diners Pavilion,Poojitha Challagali,19 October 2018,4,"This place has the calm atmosphere and absolutely tasty food in a royal ambience.
The staff is friendly and suggestive of their good dishes!"
Diners Pavilion,Aziz Ur Rahman,10 October 2018,3,It's quiet and nice but the food is nothing beyond average. The service staff was very friendly though. Good if you prefer privacy over food.
Diners Pavilion,Subhash Shahu,05 October 2018,2,Been here today with teammates and the food for non vegetarian was not up to the mark. All the chicken starters had small pieces of bones. Every bite was with a bone. The main course was just OK.
Diners Pavilion,Atulmaharaj,06 October 2018,4,"We went on a Monday for dinner and there was hardly anyone there. Looked quite spacious. The music playlist is good and so is the ambience. Being a vegetarian I'll surely recommend you to try their Stuffed Mushrooms, succulent and delicious. The Ulte Tawa ka Paratha was pretty good too. I did feel that the amount of curry/dal served was more than that is served at other places. Read my entire experience on the blog. ...

Diners Pavilion,Apaar Agrawal,28 September 2018,1,Worst service ever seen. Bug in food. Cold food. Not properly cooked naan. No one to listen to your request. No one even to serve plates. Just two waiters who are busy in themselves. Uncourteous staff. Manager paid no regards. Not even an apology for such a bad service.
Diners Pavilion,Mohammad Taukir,21 September 2018,5,"Our first experience with diners pavilion was pretty. The ambience was good. they have a buffet lunch starters , live pasta and main courses was as usual tasty. Staff is polite and care about."
Diners Pavilion,Pranay Mahi Barnwal,21 September 2018,3,"Went there in lunch buffet, overall food quality was ok except dessert and welcome drink.
The worst part was the bill provided by them was not having any GST.
And when I checked with them they mentioned that they won‚Äôt provide GST bills."
Diners Pavilion,Nupur Rani,14 September 2018,2,"Was here on a Friday evening with friends for dinner. They have both buffet and ala carte options available. Ambience is good. But the service needs to be improved in terms of the staff availability for taking orders and re-orders. The food was quite average. Liked the veg nizami we ordered for main course. The veg manchow soup was really bad though. The taste of food can be improved. Overall,not a very satisfying experience."
Diners Pavilion,Raghu,11 September 2018,3,"Been to this place after listening a positive review from friend. Had lunch in this place.
Starters are good especially the veg ones.
Main course is ok.
I mostly liked Nizami handi and mutton curry.
Chicken biryani and curd rice are good.

But, desserts are very limited and live counter has only one option. Only one option in mocktail.

Overall ok."
Diners Pavilion,Urmita Das,11 September 2018,4,"A go-to place in Gachibowli (especially for Team LunchesüòÉüòÉ ) since they have an amazing offer running now.
449/- AI for Veg and 549/- AI for Non Veg Buffet.

~Ambience (4.5/5)
The place looks pretty bright with a golden yellow theme Chandeliers and wooden furnitures...gives d place a Royal Feeling ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

~Buffet Spread (4/5)
Coming to the buffet spread, I really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink, probably cranberry juice it was.
As for the starters, there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a Friday Lunch afternoon.
I really loved the Cheese Broccoli, Crispy Corn and Chilli My among the veg ones.
And in my non veg options, Chicken hariyali Tikka, Fish Tikka were amazing.

Next comes the main course, although I was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here, but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and I could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and Some nicely cooked Chicken Dum Biryani with a an okayish Mutton Roganjosh.

Last but not the least, we ended our lunch with Hot Gulab Jamun along with vanilla ice cream. There were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they weren't that great.
Yet again a disappointment in Desserts Section!!üòêüòêüòí

Overall I think this place should be a good option to try out especially when the prices are quite decent and the food quality is good too."
Diners Pavilion,Nirmal Jena,06 September 2018,5,A huge spacious place with good ambience.i like the food here a lot.today I found out there are having live pasta in buffet.starter are yummy.serves was good.
Diners Pavilion,Deepak Banka,03 September 2018,3,"The ambience of this place is really good. The food is not upto the mark, especially Italian food. The room kind of setup inside the restaurant is really cool and would be ideal for a team lunch/dinner."
Diners Pavilion,Kaushal Dahal,02 September 2018,5,Probably one of the best locations in gachibowli. it has been A wonderful experience .The food and service was really good and very prompt. We really enjoyed it. Keep it up.
Diners Pavilion,Lakshmi P,01 September 2018,2,The ambience is good. But the food wasn t upto the mark. The non veg starters were horrible. Full of bones. The veg starters were okayish. The variety was less. The main course was okay. There was variety but no taste. There were hardly any desserts. Disappointed.
Diners Pavilion,Pratik Kumar,29 August 2018,4,"We were here for team lunch ,It was good experience ,but there should be more desert item it was having lots of verity but quality should be updated ."
Diners Pavilion,Pavan S,25 August 2018,5,"It was good to have a food here.for my taste and budget, I was able to find good varieties of food.the taste of veg biryani was awesome and staff also served us better."
Diners Pavilion,The Fit Foodie üòãüòéü§ë,25 August 2018,3,Nice ambiance. Food is good to average nothing to write home about ?. My only complaint is the portion size which is a tad smaller for the money u r paying. We ordered hariyali tikka which was too soft n yummy. One crispy fried chicken whose actual name I forgot. Overall a nice experience partly due to the courteous staff but food portion is something that can be looked into.
Diners Pavilion,Vishu,21 August 2018,5,It has been a wonderful experience .Been here with my best friend to throw a party . He loved it alot . couldn't have asked for a better day. Food items where yummy and delicious for both veg and non veg. service is very good.
Diners Pavilion,Balram Samal,17 August 2018,4,"Awesome food.. good ambience... ,,, Very humble staff. ... Food also really good and testy...,,,,,,,,nice place everything is ok but need to lmprove of service?."

Diners Pavilion,Ritika Thakur,04 August 2018,4,"Nice ambience.
Hospitable staff.
Great food.

We had North Indian and Italian with a few drinks.

Everything was just awesome.

Really liked it."
Diners Pavilion,Shubham Shukla,03 August 2018,1,"Today's visit with friends for the lunch was a terrible experience.
Food - below average
Service - pathetic the attitude the waiters had was shocking
We booked through call and when we reached they declined the booking after sometime they said they will arrange place. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for starters and that too after one serving they were dealing second serving. My previous visits were descent but this visit was super bad experience."
Diners Pavilion,SONALIKA,03 August 2018,1,"Many issues to start with :
1. No Valet Parking as quoted .
2. Everything that was served on the plate was chilled , and I mean it.
3. Nothing was planned , like the placement of food , it was more of a day to day kitchen.
4. On the contrary , Ice-cream was already melt :)

Taste was good, had it been served properly it would've definitely deserved more than 4*.

Hope these things are taken proper care of."
Diners Pavilion,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),31 July 2018,4,"Ambiance-
Diner's Pavilion is located at the Times Square, Indira Nagar exactly below Mustang Terrace Lounge. Diner's Pavilion is a casual dining restaurant famous for Continental as well as North Indian food. A well decorated Diner's pavilion, has indoor sitting available with live sports screening and the silent English songs playing in the background.
Food and drinks-
They serve beer at cost as low as approximately INR 99. In starters, we usually order chicken Tandoori and kebab. Food in here is delicious and with low cost. Diner's pavilion offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service is quite slow but the staff is polite."
Diners Pavilion,Kurra Nani,29 July 2018,5,It was wonderful experience ! From the time to step in till step out from restaurant they treated every one with respect & politeness in words! Meal served hot and it has very good taste .looking forward to check-in in this restaurant in coming days for our all events...
Diners Pavilion,Apoorv Srivastava,27 July 2018,1,"Not the best experience. Staff isn't prompt, neither aware of what on the menu is actually available in the kitchen. Indifferent to any standards of service. Visited twice in 2 days, had poor experience both the times."
Diners Pavilion,Manidhar_pjr,26 July 2018,3,"Probably one of the most pocket friendly buffet places in the city. The place is spacious and the food tastes good. This is the apt place for small team lunch. The ambience of the place is good and there is TV provided to entertain you.

Diners Pavilion,Varanasi Vivek,21 July 2018,1,"Visited this place for my team lunch, and the experience was pathetic.
PreBooked the tables online, got call back from restaurant asking for some advance money for the lunch. Something new which I didn‚Äôt come across in recent times. This somehow got sorted and when we came there for lunch,
They are on 3rd floor, when entered the lift - It was leaking water from its ceiling.
Entered restaurant, look was good, our tables were arranged, we said about number of veg and non veg plates. Starters were served on the table.
Service was very bad, slow and no one was very much bothered about refills, had to request multiple times for refills. Taste was mild, some lacked salt, some lacked spice. Over all starters were ok.
Then comes the main course and main culprit- when we reached for food, most of the bowls were empty. So waited for refill- in the meanwhile my eyes fell on available prawns curry. I got them in a bowl and few roties on my table. Prawns were raw.... yukkkkkkk.... not properly boiled and cooked. I said this to the manager out there, but got a cold response. I didn‚Äôt try anything else in main course, but some of my frnds said biryani was ok but others were bad.
Halwa, ice cream and cut fruits were on deserts.

When were were done with our lunch- then manager came and apologised for the prawns and asked me to retry as he got them prepared again for me - it made me feel privileged. Had discussed on other items with the manager, and got my prawns in a bowl. To my surprise this was even pathetic experience. He mixed the older ones with the new curry and made it even worse.

I Would highly not recommend this place.
Sorry sorry for choosing this place for a team lunch."
Diners Pavilion,Mr. Ego,20 July 2018,4,"Beginning with the ambience, its okay. Nothing to great about it. But the food here is good. The quantity in starters are less. The main course is good. The food items that are worth trying :
- Chilli Cheese Naan
- Shrimp Fettuccine (for sea food lovers only)
- Thread Chicken

Butter chicken and Lal Maans was okay, not that great.
Under mocktails, I tried the Pino Orange, it was just a plain orange juice.

The starters, especially the fish was too salty. Need improvement there.

The service is really good. The food prices are affordable and overall a good place to have dinner."
Diners Pavilion,Nikita,18 July 2018,5,"Went for a late lunch at this place. Even though the venue was booked for a birthday celebration, they accommodated us at their rooftop venue of MUSTANG. The view and the overall ambience was beautiful. The menu of diners pavilion(they have the same kitchen) had enough choices and variety. We ordered basic North Indian and the food was heavenly. Great service and even after levying 10% service charge, the bill was pretty easy on the pocket (having Zomato Gold makes it even better!!) All in all a great place for family lunches and dinners!"
Diners Pavilion,Lokesh,15 July 2018,5,quick delivery
Diners Pavilion,Shubhra Hajela,12 July 2018,1,I ordered food from here through swiggy. Had a guest coming over for dinner. Ordered butter chicken and adraki mutton. The dishes were horrendous and inedible. The butter chicken had gone stale and smelt pungent. The adraki mutton's gravy was NOTHING but oil. Was shocked to see such atrocious quality being sent. What was more nerve wrecking was that I was banking on these dishes for my guest. Will never ever order from here. Wish I could give you a rating less than 1.
Diners Pavilion,Sohan,11 July 2018,5,Awesome food and ambience. The staff were really quick and served food with smile. Overall it was a nice experience having lunch at Diners pavilion.
Diners Pavilion,Shreya Soni,08 July 2018,4,"I would rate this place 4 out of 5. Food - starters are tasty, they don't have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also I feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream, cake and some halwa. We visited this place around 2-2:15 p.m and we were only left in the restaurant and I believe it was there closing time so they couldn't give more attention to us. This restaurant is worth giving a try.
Team DP one suggestion add some variety in sweets."
Diners Pavilion,Manish,03 July 2018,1,order 2 allo parotha got only one
Diners Pavilion,Vamsi,02 July 2018,5,delivery person is not all good very much troubled with delivery man food is nice diners pavilion take thumsup
Diners Pavilion,Aanchal Khemka,01 July 2018,1,"We did not had a good experience as my rating says it all!

The main issue which annoyed me was the non veg was being cut just behind where veg main course was served. We being vegetarian, it was not a very good site.

In dessert, initially only halwa was there and then ice cream and gulab jamun was added.

Starters were also extremely salty.

Overall, except the ambiance and good music, this place is not meant for us."
Diners Pavilion,Venkatesh Pattapu,01 July 2018,5,super
Diners Pavilion,Gopalakrishnan Krishnanand,30 June 2018,4,"Went for lunch party...Usual buffet spread but food tasted real good. Ambience is wonderful and interiors are neatly done...Starters are served at the table. Value for money place. Very comfortable unlike other buffet spots that are crammed for space. It's the usual problem in gachibowli where you have to park the cars on the road, their valet parking being shared with other outlets is usually full."
Diners Pavilion,Vishesh Agarwal,30 June 2018,4,"Nice ambience-4/5
Do try :

Munchow soup-4/5
Nijami Handi-5/5
Fried rice-3/5
Paneer paratha-3/5

Do keep check on the bill, they add service charge by default (on top of GST) and you will have to specifically ask them to remove it."
Diners Pavilion,Tulasi G,30 June 2018,4,"Taste is good, but quantity is very less for that price"
Diners Pavilion,Debanjan Bhaumik,30 June 2018,1,"The food here is a total insult to restaurant business. I ordered lal maas- which was totally not the dish at all, it looked and tasted unhealthy(full of red onions, they shd hav named d dish lal piyaas). Neways, I asked the manager to replace the dish and he insisted on trying their adrakhi malai mutton which again was not the dish they had mentioned in d menu. Instead of adrakh they put garlic ‚Äî a lot of it! with a watery type gravyü§£. Upon complaining, the manager said that their head chef has left for the day, hence the food is not the way it is. I mean dude! Seriously! thats your reason?. Guys pls stay away from this place. Its a place for disrupting ur digestives system, insult to your hard earned money and insult to the mutton they procured to cook."
Diners Pavilion,Sunil Prajapat,24 June 2018,3,"My second visit to this place. Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.

The ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.

Veg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.

The service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.

I've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

Diners Pavilion,Varun R Nair,03 June 2018,5,"Had the ‚ÄúPrawns Phad Thai Noodles‚Äù and ‚ÄúVeg Greek Salad‚Äù.

RATINGS ::

1. Food Quality : 5/5
One word: Fantabulous!

2. Food Quantity : 4/5
Veg Greek Salad - Medium bowl
Prawns Phad Thai Noodles - Large Bowl (5-6 big prawn chunks, egg chunks, variety of other veggie chunks)

3. Food Packaging : 3.5/5
Decent packaging. Hot on delivery.

4. Value for money : 4/5
Bit pricey on scale. However, the quality is flawless. Worth it!

--------------
1. Prawns Phad Thai Noodles :
Big chunks of prawns (around 5-6) with Thai style noodles. Best part was the additional veggie varieties (cut in style) and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles. Veggies were carrot, mushrooms, cucumber, onion etc.
Moderately spicy. A drink like ‚Äòlassi/buttermilk‚Äô would complement well.

2. Veg Greek Salad :
Standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers, tomato, black olives, onions etc. with a happy twist of creamy raita. 
The cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold. 
True exhibition of healthy yet tasty food.

Diners Pavilion,Devesh Padmey,31 May 2018,2,"The service was disappointing. The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service."
Asian Meal Box,Siddharth Kushwaha,23 May 2019,4,Meal box are value for money. The tossed noodles are soft and much healthier than fried and chicken quality is also good. The only con is that chicken is not spicy even after selecting the spicy option. Overall taste is good.
Asian Meal Box,Nandu Chepuri,20 May 2019,2,"Taste was good, though I ordered large the quantity was too little. Chicken quantity was very less.

I ordered extra egg which is no where found."

I ordered Gobi chilli and tossed noodles combo(medium) together with one gobi chilli extra.
Veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. It's been 2years in Gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles I have ever had here. The garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.
Medium combo is best for a hungry adult. I don't know about mini combo as I didn't order it.
Highly recommended place."

I got TRIPLE BLACK PEPPER fried rice sprinkled with some vegetables, and dried up chilli chicken. Imagine you come home from a long day, order some food so that you can just eat and go to bed but then, this happens.
I've had Chinese food before. I think I know what fried rice should taste like. Asian Meal Box, I'm sorry but my experience was disappointing. Never ordering again and definitely not recommending to anyone."
Asian Meal Box,Anwesha Das,25 March 2019,3,The food is good here...I am looking forward to order more from here... And the food is at reasonable price so anyone can afford it. They deliver ur order in time.
Asian Meal Box,Deepak Arora,20 March 2019,1,I ordered chilli potato with fried rice box and i specifically mentioned the spicy box. But maybe the restaurant does not know what does spicy means and u can also see that the color of rice is nearly equal to white. It was totally waste of money. Chilli potato was even worst in this . I'll suggest you to never order from this place.
Asian Meal Box,Sachinsablok1984,19 March 2019,1,"Disappointed, crispy baby corn is completely soggy, it was also tasteless. First experience is horrible, along with very poor portion size. It can't even be enough for 1 person."
Asian Meal Box,Saddam,12 March 2019,4,A perfect afternoon meal with 200-350 calorie meal good amount of chicken also close to 10-18gm protein it also has bell peppers which will help you have a rainbow diet (the values are) approx)
Asian Meal Box,Renuka Nair,12 March 2019,1,"Food looked so yum!!! But sadly I could have only two morsels because then I realized that my ""pure"" veg fried rice and paneer had scrambled egg ""remains"" in it. Not one whole egg, so that I can at least remove it (I am not repulsed by egg, chicken would have been a different story, of course!) But this was bits and pieces mixed in the rice and gravy. No way to remove them.

I would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!

Vegetarians beware!!!

I have just added the initial pic with the big piece, the rest small pieces in the rice, I did not have the patience to click or pick.
Never ordering from here ever again!"
Asian Meal Box,D.S,03 March 2019,1,"Waste of money , tried there Vegetable noodle and chilli chicken gravy combo . Noodle was tasteless , chilly chicken was hard and gravy was just average ."
Asian Meal Box,Souvik,02 March 2019,1,The worst place to have Chinese. Will serve you with red chilli powder red rice. Don't know what Chinese is actually. Disgusting disgusting a d disgusting.
Asian Meal Box,P Arora,28 February 2019,4,"Mini Chinese Cravings... This is the place to order. I ordered Gobi Manchurian with Tossed Noodles & Veg Hot and Sour Soup
. Received it in well packed box, which is sufficient for one foodie. The soup was spiced fine and was delicious to order again. Same goes with noodles but would prefer to get some less black pepper next time. 

While everything seemed and tasted good, Gobi Manchurian missed the spot. Under impression of regular Manchurian balls i ordered this meal box but got regular Gobi dipped in Manchurian sauce. This spoiled the whole taste as at each bite you taste Gobi instead of Manchurian sauce. A new way but not for me.

Foodance just warmed up for soup and noodles. 
Would prefer to rate 3.5 but no option for that."
Asian Meal Box,Kaushal Rg,27 February 2019,3,too many veggies for a non veg box.
Asian Meal Box,Vidyan256,24 February 2019,5,"Very nice food and ambience.
Can get all types of veg and egg items in this restaurant. Good place to hang with friends and family and everyone"
Asian Meal Box,Ankur Ghosh,16 February 2019,1,"What a hopeless restaurant. Never experienced such horrific and unprofessional restaurant. If you order a dish, be assured you will get cheaper , stale and some other item. I have ordered Chicken Manchurian and Egg Noodle Box, I received Old,Stake Gobi munchurian with just minimum two-three spoon of pathetic noodle.
Please dont dare do visit there"
Asian Meal Box,Smart Sriram,15 February 2019,5,I like the food here. Especially the combos like Ghobi manchurian and Fried rice.I always prefer this combo.Thanks for serving the good food.
Asian Meal Box,Dangeti Anuraag,13 February 2019,4,It would be great if even raitha is given with the food
Asian Meal Box,Sathesh Saravanan,13 February 2019,1,it is said medium but it looks like small only.
Asian Meal Box,Vishal Kumar,11 February 2019,1,I have ordered chicken noodles.It was very worst.The noodles were hard and chicken was also not of good taste.Very disappointed with the order.
Asian Meal Box,Chakra2508,08 February 2019,1,"food is awesome, but delivered food after 1:30 hours late.when called and asked they replied, there are lot of orders.this is not fare.we waited almost 90mins for 20mins delivery"
Asian Meal Box,Nitin Pandula,04 February 2019,5,"Order through Zomato. I ordered Egg noodles with chicken 65 meal box for lunch and relished it thoroughly. I ordered Veg fried rice with chicken 65 meal box for dinner on same day. This was also pretty tasty. I have ordered medium size for lunch and the quantity was a fad bit more for one person., however small size box was apt for a single person.

Would love to order many more times from this place."
Asian Meal Box,Akanksha Anand,30 January 2019,1,The food was so salty. Couldnot eat it at all. Money wasted. Chicken was not properly cooked. There was no salt in the chicken while the rice was full with salt. No balance.
Asian Meal Box,Shrishti Shree,24 January 2019,3,"We ordered chilly potato and chicken noodles. Both were disappointing. The chilly potato tasted like raw potatoes being forcefully dipped in tomato sauce.

The noodles were totally tasteless and we had to add spices to make it taste better. Worst of all it had no salt.

Not recommended."
Asian Meal Box,Eswar,23 January 2019,3,"This place has never disappointed me, a go-to restaurant at any time.When you want to give some standard benchmark for a Egg fried rice or its combo with any starter,this place will be on top of my mind.Only negative is they have options for spicy,curdy and ....which they will consider before cooking.Can improve on this."
Asian Meal Box,Aditya Chopra,19 January 2019,3,"The rice is not well steamed and is hard. Did not expect this quality of rice to be delivered, else chicken and the gravy was perfect and the sourness is just perfect."
Asian Meal Box,Aditya Nanduri,18 January 2019,5,ordered Chilli baby corn fried rice and the food is delicious..... Great food with multiple options.... I enjoyed the food. quantity is decent....
Asian Meal Box,Deepak Ahuja,15 January 2019,1,"Ordered noodles and fried rice box. Almost no gravy with very little pieces of Paneer/manchurian. Noodles felt to have gone bad when opened. Mostly felt like last nights food.
Would not recommend."
Asian Meal Box,Sachin Patil,13 January 2019,1,Food quality are not good . I ordered large box but food quantity are very less . My last two order box are packed with cello tape but this time box are open .Waste of money.
Asian Meal Box,NeHa NeHz,10 January 2019,5,Noodles combo is always the best priority for me. They taste so good with the. Tossed potato or potato 65. also the cost is reasonable too.......
Asian Meal Box,Venkat,04 January 2019,3,"Ordered Potato combo of noodels .It was good but as earlier the packing is not good. No seal and some food came out of box while I opened.

Cimmincated to zomato paid 20 credits but don't know what was it about."
Asian Meal Box,Khushboo Pandey,02 January 2019,2,"Ordered 1 veg fried rice and chilli potato with steam rice for 181 rupees.
Quality: 1/5.. I dont know what the hell they have cooked , I ordered sour and spicy food I dont know in which world this food was spicy.. there was nothing, on the name of chilli potato they gave aloo ki sabji and do they wanted to cook rest of rice by ourself? it was hard to bite
Quantity: 4/5 its fine as per cost, and I wanted to rate the restaurant as 1 but 1 extra point for quantity
Value for money: 2/5- if you have veryyyy less moiney and you can adjust with taste just want to fill you stomach with some garbage you can go for it"
Asian Meal Box,Praful,01 January 2019,1,"Wow!!! Just wow!! What a let down!! I ordered Potato 65 with Egg Noodles Box
, Spicy Level : Sour, Spicy and Curdy, Extra : Egg,  Quantity : Large.

Now I choose an extra egg for the noodles and wanted it to be sour, spicy and curdy. It was neither sour or spicy or curdy or even edible. It has no Flavors whatsoever. To quote the great gordon ramsay... ITS BLAAAAND!!!!The potato 65 is just semi boiled potato with some red cover on. How did you guys made it so tasteless. Everything is just BLAND!! Why doesnt it taste of even salt. I choose the extra egg but honest to god there is no traces of any extra egg. You failed on every level possible! I threw the entire thing in a bin because its not easy eating bland noodles. I would never order from you folks again.This was my first online order this year... and I am regretting a big deal!"
Asian Meal Box,Sharad Porwal,01 January 2019,1,"Worst food I have received on Zomato till now!!
If you guyz don't want to give discount then dont do it but why are you serving bad food. Aloo 65 is not even half cooked, cooked in some cheap quality tomato sauce. Noodles were icy cold and were not cooked properly either. Stop wasting food."
Asian Meal Box,Sneha Chinni,01 January 2019,1,They charged money for ketchup but they didn't provide any ketchup without ketchup how people can eat Gobi Manchuria and onion lemon are also not provided so no taste
Asian Meal Box,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),01 January 2019,5,"This place is always my favorite when to comes to some light eat. I highly recommend their Ginger garlic chicken noodle box and Ginger garlic potato noodle box.

Asian Meal Box,Rajesh T,25 December 2018,3,"ordered chilli paneer with egg fried rice combo, paneer was good, but egg fried rice taste is just okay. Remaining strarters gobi manchurain and baby corn manchurian are average. They should improve in starters.."
Asian Meal Box,Kishlay Kumar,24 December 2018,5,Good delivery
Asian Meal Box,AAKRITI BHATNAGAR,21 December 2018,1,The worst place to eat at in Hyderabad. The people are extremely rude and the food tastes as bad as the people behave. The service is poor as well
Asian Meal Box,Suneel G,20 December 2018,1,Got different items than I ordered. Be careful before taking the order. The guy is irresponsible not checking and delivering without seeing order.
Asian Meal Box,Shrivatsav Sundar,19 December 2018,2,Ordered chilly paneer with fried rice which tasted really bad. The quantity of the paneer was less and it was so dry. The paneer and fried rice didn't go well together. The taste of the rice was more sour than expected and was difficult to complete it. The package was not taped and the ketchup was missing for which I have paid. Highly disappointed with the service.
Asian Meal Box,Pavan Aditya M S,18 December 2018,4,"food is good but the service is not upto the mark, my order was late by 15 mins. so please try avoiding such inconveniences any further"
Asian Meal Box,Pn Santosh,08 December 2018,3,not so good. I asked for spicy and Curdy but received a one with regular taste. this this this this this this this this this this this this.

Asian Meal Box,Debasmita Ghosh,03 December 2018,3,I like the combos they offer and the quality and quantity of food and the way they send it across. Have ordered multiple times and the combos were never disappointing. This place serves rhe best quick food and ready food. Chinese combos are must try here when you want a quick meal during office hours or on a lazy weekend.
Asian Meal Box,Satish Ch,02 December 2018,3,"Ordered item: chilli baby corn with double egg noodles
Taste: It's neither too good nor bad...noodles is average and chilli baby corn is not spicy...overall taste is just ok

Asian Meal Box,Priyanka,02 December 2018,1,not good.
Asian Meal Box,Sudha Gadige,21 November 2018,2,"I ordered noodles with gobi Manchuria. Trust me... The noodles were so fat and without any taste. The Sauces or the fry that noodles went through, there was no taste at all in it. It was not even having the basic salt. Managed to eat with the gobi given in the box and later realized that there not more than 5 pieces of Manchuria. Thus, I could not even complete the noodles. Was not at all satisfied with the noodles combo box."
Asian Meal Box,Aamir Nawaz,19 November 2018,4,"Have ordered a couple of times from here and taste is always consistent. Rice quality as well as chicken pieces are good.

Asian Meal Box,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,18 October 2018,4,"#Vegetarian review
Chinese cravings and I found this place to order!! I will now be a frequent customer of this chinese place because i loved my food. I ordered paneer Manchurian with tossed noodles. After discount i got them for 120 bucks which is a decent amount to pay for a meal for one. The quantity was not a lot but yes sufficient enough for one person.

The noodles were perfectly cooked. Rightly chopped veggies in right amount. Right sauces, perfectly sour. I loved the noodles.
The paneer Manchurian was a little on the drier side to go with the noodles, the paneer was a bit stiff too, but the gravy was amazing.

All in all it was a happy meal üòÉ Must try!!!
Value for money - 5/5"
Asian Meal Box,Shravya Gunipudi,09 October 2018,4,"On an impulse, I got my food delivered from here. I ordered Manchow soup which was quite good. This was followed by a noodles bowl and a fried rice combo, both of which were excellent. The chicken was good, the paneer was good.
No complaints."
Asian Meal Box,Siddharth Karidi,06 October 2018,1,the food has 0 taste the rice is not cooked properly. the panner is very hard and chewy. what kind of food Is this?? why do they have 3.5 rating for this kind of food!! I want u to take immediate action !

Asian Meal Box,Vijaya Lakshmi,04 October 2018,1,very oily
Asian Meal Box,Charushila Biswas,04 October 2018,2,"Imagine eating rice with dry fried potato!!! I really don't understand how they serve rice with Indian Chinese chicken manchurian without a drop of gravy in it. I mean, did I order starters to eat with rice? plus the chicken pieces were very few and cooked so much that the chicken was fibrous and dry. BTW, who puts coriander leaves in fried rice?? People have raita and salan with biriyani. Why? Because just the rice and chicken is difficult to chew and swallow. Use some common sense, guys."
Asian Meal Box,Prasad Mudiraj,04 October 2018,4,Good
Asian Meal Box,Sunita Bamble,01 October 2018,5,Amazing food. Just loved the food. First time order and it's just amazing. One thing just that you can improve on is please provide spoons and folks for orders
Asian Meal Box,Priya,30 September 2018,1,quantitity is very small and the taste is worst
Asian Meal Box,Jaswanth Desu,30 September 2018,1,"I ordered Veg Manchow soup, Chili Gobi, Noodles with panner 65.
Manchow soup is Gud.

Asian Meal Box,Nagabandi Nikhil,23 September 2018,1,dirty food
Asian Meal Box,Sudhansu Shekhar Bisoi,23 September 2018,2,"Ordered 4 fried rice box.
The rice was not cooked properly. And was basically hard to eat.
The panner in chilli panner rice box were very hard and the flavor didn't get through the outer coat of ararot and cornflour.
All four rice box were complete dry to eat. The quantity of gravy was negligible or absent... Not asking to serve gravy for noodles, but rice certainly needs a lil more grave.

Gave the 2 stars for neat packing and the timely delivery."
Asian Meal Box,Abhinay Ankala,22 September 2018,5,"Work on Saturday!! Ah what can i say...
Ordered a medium chilly chicken egg noodles box from here.
perfect combination to go with. A lil oily but... Excellent quality of food. Quantity was perfect for one.
will definitely order again... happy dining yall!"
Asian Meal Box,Monalisha Mahapatra,21 September 2018,2,the food was very bad. the noodles was blant. and the chicken was dry.
Asian Meal Box,Hussain Abbas,21 September 2018,2,Quantity was decent. But the gravy wasn't well cooked and had a bad odour. The Egg fries rice were okay but the gravy was I believe a bit undercooked and hence spoiled the taste of the complete box.
Asian Meal Box,Lakshmi,21 September 2018,4,less quantity
Asian Meal Box,Arun,20 September 2018,1,give the correct item u idiots
Asian Meal Box,Bibek,20 September 2018,5,Asian meal boc is best if u r looking for not too many option but a rice meal with a curry. The taste of food is also too good. My experience with Asian Meal Box is good till now.

Asian Meal Box,Pooja Rai,19 September 2018,1,Baby corn Manchurian was gone bad when it was delivered.
Asian Meal Box,Sandy,17 September 2018,5,good
Asian Meal Box,Ankit Agarwal,15 September 2018,1,"I just got a rice meal box which included ginger paneer on the side. And the following were my observations:-
1) the rice was semi cooked, it was not even boiled properly.
2) the paneer portion was absolutely insufficient to complement the quantity of rice.
3) the paneer tasted disgusting and it was absolutely dry though I had requested for some gravy.
4) You guys charged me for the ketchup which was never found in the package.
Despite my horrible experience, I am trying my best to be respectful about my feedback.
If you guys have even a little bit of integrity, kindly initiate a full refund on my meal. I really regret giving you a chance to serve me and I will not repeat this mistake again."
Asian Meal Box,B.malla Reddy,15 September 2018,3,avarage taste
Asian Meal Box,Vini,15 September 2018,1,the taste is not good just waste of money wan refund
Asian Meal Box,Amit Mohanty,15 September 2018,4,worth the money
Cafe Eclat,Jay Mehta,19 May 2019,4,"This place is a hiddengem!

Went to buy their sourdough bread.ended up having their mushroom soup, death by chocolate cake and key lime tart.

Mushroom soup came with grilled sourdough, everything was good about it. The bread could be toasted with garlic butter

The bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good. The bread is something we will go again to buy.

Lime tart Was better than expectation . The cream was way too much.

Death by chocolate was delicious, rich chocolate. Was not able to finish in one go, will have to get on it tomorrow again.

Highly recommend this place. Will go their again for there sandwiches/sourdough pizza and burger."
Cafe Eclat,Minocher Hansotia,18 May 2019,5,Great selection of freshly made breads. Macaroons were well made. Breakfast here is a welcome change and worth the experience. Found all the items that I had were really good and fresh.Staff are very helpful and courteous. They know what goes into making quality bakery stuff and stick to it.
Cafe Eclat,Asha Tejaswini,17 May 2019,4,"Visit this place for awesome bakery options. Tried pasta and toffee apple doughnut. Though pasta is not up to the mark, apple doughnut balanced it out. The ambiance is pretty cool."
Cafe Eclat,Rajiv Singh,15 May 2019,4,Amazing breakfast options. Also happy to find some authentic Italian cuisine available here. Nice desserts as well. The coffee here is amazing.
Cafe Eclat,Shwetan Sriram,10 May 2019,5,"Terrific experience! Amazing place for breakfast/brunch! Loved the sour dough bread, hazelnut latte, french toast, pan cakes etc. One tiny suggestion is for you guys to serve more chocolate and blueberry sauce with the pancakes! loved the time spent here."
Cafe Eclat,Amardeep Dabass,06 May 2019,5,One of those little cafes that is as laid back as you want to be. The cold coffees and ice teas are pretty good. The ambience is pretty good too. Wish they had some board games or toys to keep little guests busy
Cafe Eclat,Naina Bhardwaj,04 May 2019,2,I didn't like the food at all !! We ordered thin crust pizza quatro formagio and it was not thin crust at all with very bland taste on top of that . Then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat . Couldn't even finish it ! Then we went for a very cheese pannini . Another dish we couldn't finish . The bread was too thick to eat ! overall huge disappointment for me !
Cafe Eclat,Anish Waghray,03 May 2019,4,"Food is amazing , had their English Lamb Panini , Butter Croissant and Elderflower Lemonade.
Ambience could be better ..
Service/staff is/are courteous..
Slightly expensive ..But definitely worth a visit for breakfast.
Their Sour Dough Breads are good too"
Cafe Eclat,Shilpa Prusty,28 April 2019,4,"Happened to try the breakfast option here.It is a good place to have english breakfast.All the ingredients are cooked ,baked fresh..The breads are really soft.We ordered swiss Muesli..it was delicious.However,the portion served was too less for 300 bucks..It was not sufficient for even a single person.We ordered baked spinach omelette,which was fluffy and melted in mouth.I have to say ,the taste was something I would wanna return here again for..French toast served with maple syrup was also nicely made..
Taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas.
A bit expensive due to their natural flavours and self made products."
Cafe Eclat,Apoorva Reddy,28 April 2019,1,"Ordered tiramisu cup cake, brownie, green apple mojito and garlic bread. Unfortunately, nothing was good. Grossly misled by high zomato rating. Wouldn't recommend this place even to my frenemies!!"
Cafe Eclat,Utkarsh Ranjan,26 April 2019,5,"Eclat has the best cheesecake in town. The blueberry topping on my cake was really fresh and delicious.
Their home baked breads are also a must try."
Cafe Eclat,Mula Renuka,20 April 2019,4,"This is one of my regular hangout place. It‚Äôs a small and cosy place. The ambience is decent and it has a see through kitchen. The food served here is very hygienic. You get to choose from a variety of options. The vegetarian options are limited though. I have tried their Pasta , pizza , hummus , coffee , hot chocolate , cup cakes , gelatos and soup. The taste of every item is good. The food looks very appetizing and tastes delicious. If you are searching for some cafe in Gachibowli then do visit this place."
Cafe Eclat,Jeevak Gupta,20 April 2019,5,My all time favorite for bakery items and pizza. Beats European Croissant any day. Try the butter croissant for breakfast. Don't miss the hot chocolate.
Cafe Eclat,Megha Chanda,15 April 2019,3,"Bakery items in the bread section are tasty. Croissants, bagels etc. Muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet. Definitely can improve on those. Not recommended for strong coffee seekers. If you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages, then you can give it a try."
Cafe Eclat,Shivani Gupta,14 April 2019,1,"Food is really bad. I ordered aglio olio pasta, pesto veg sandwich, quesadilla, peach iced tea and broccoli sweet corn turnover starter. The taste was really bad, not even average. They put tomatoes in everything and the bread was really hard. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone."
Cafe Eclat,Moonis Ahmed,12 April 2019,4,"What a great find. Went for a late night snacking/coffee and the food, service, ambiance were amazing.

We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

Ambiance - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Value for Money - 4/5"
Cafe Eclat,Vivani,11 April 2019,5,I was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place! This is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover. The Eggs Benedict with salmon is my favourite. Our visit to cafe Eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast! Do try it and you would cherish every single bite! I hardly have pictures because as soon as the food arrives we just attack! The one I have attached was taken to make my sister jealous :)
Cafe Eclat,Anil Rao,07 April 2019,5,I ordered from this establishment many times in the past - and all the food was quite good - perhaps unlike anything in Hyderabad.  But today I wished to have the traditional Fish & Chips served in English and Irish pubs in the UK and America.  Theirs is Batter Dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in India in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.
Cafe Eclat,Shafia Shams,30 March 2019,4,"This place has one of the most amazing menu , great choices from pasta,burgers,breakfast option,in house made desserts and customized Gelato.
 The most interesting part is that has an open viewing kitchen where we can see freshly prepared bakery items,tarts and macaroons which will leave you wanting for more . Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte. The quality of bread used is really one of the best.

Would love to visit this place again just to try the yummy spread of desserts and gelato."
Cafe Eclat,Ayush Khatri,24 March 2019,2,"I had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered Death by Chocolate cake and Quadruple Swiss Chocolate Cookie.
Cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . Death by Chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. It was really disappointing."
Cafe Eclat,Sankeerth Das,17 March 2019,3,"So I‚Äôve been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast, so I‚Äôd say that their bakery items are out of the world. Freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass.
Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great, would give it a 2/5
They use their own recipes and sauces.
Also, most importantly it‚Äôs a big hole to your pocket. Very expensive. So watch out"
Cafe Eclat,Anoop Prakash,07 March 2019,4,"Boy do I love their bakery products, especially their fresh bread. That whole wheat bread is to die for. 170 bucks, 3 times as expensive as one from old Madras baking company, but 3 times better in taste as well.

They have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental, and desserts. I loved the quattro fromaggi, as it was made from fresh sourdough bread.

The only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries (400 bucks for a cheesecake for example) and average cafe latte. But am a frequent customer here nonetheless, some guilty pleasures of life."
Cafe Eclat,Preethi Pusarla,06 March 2019,3,"This place serves frozen food mostly. They just reheat the food and give it you.
Liked the cinnamon roll over there.
We ordered Pasta and it was just fine.
And yeah it is expensive."
Cafe Eclat,Tejasvi Mohan,04 March 2019,4,"Heard a lot about this cafe from my friends in Hyderabad. Located in Gachibowli it‚Äôs one pocket friendly continental cafe. I tried pizza, Mexican buns, sourdough bread sandwich, cappuccino and a death by chocolate cake. Pretty cool stuff, kitchen has a transparent facade makes it a little uncomfortable for the people sitting in right corner"
Cafe Eclat,Mounikagampa,02 March 2019,5,"This place is near to my office. It is on the same building of playstreet, next to F45 and opp to plabo. During my cousin's visit to india, we used to visit this place for a coffee after dropping their kid at play school. I would like to review about the cake which we ordered during my cousins birthday. We are around 5. Ordered gluten free options like chicken sandwich, mango juice and a cake. I completely forgot the name of the cake but it is the best. Ambience is good. It is bit expensive."
Cafe Eclat,Shiva Varma,21 February 2019,4,I came here with my family last month we had a burger and taste is good and good place for family and friends and pleople can bring their children...
Cafe Eclat,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,10 February 2019,3,"Just happened to be here today. Coffees are a try out. Caramel and hazelnut latte are good. Vanilla latte is average.
Coming to starters fish and chips can be tried out. Shepard's pie seems good but is costly. Chicken quiche is not good at all. Don't try.
Desserts are good specially croissants."
Cafe Eclat,Manisha Dash,08 February 2019,3,"Situated at one of the prime locations, √©clat was an average experience. Ambience is good and service was decent (guess they did not have many servers on that day). The dessert we ordered was good but the chicken steak and burger were made of frozen chicken which was extremely chewy. Beverages were decent. Had heard a lot about the place but overall would rate it as just 3."
Cafe Eclat,Swati Sk,06 February 2019,4,"This is quite a cute little cafe.. The food here is delicious although the prices could have been a tad less.. loved the French toast here.. Had the chicken panini here.. the paninoli bread was quite hard..
You can see your food being prepared here..."
Cafe Eclat,Debabrati Sonia,03 February 2019,5,My favourite cafe around gachibowli. A little overpriced but worth the taste and service. Tiramisu cupcake is a must try over here.. Fresh baked breads are preservetive free and really fresh..
Cafe Eclat,Ashima Singh,03 February 2019,3,"Staffs were polite.
Cafe is cute and small. Very cozy and comfy. Good for catching up with friends and date sort of.
A little over price.
Could have better food menu."
Cafe Eclat,Prawal Agarwal,28 January 2019,3,"Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.
Taste - 4 stars
Value For Money - 2 star
Overall - 3 stars"
Cafe Eclat,Prasannarao2011,27 January 2019,5,"Extremely happy with the food. It‚Äôs the 5th time we have been there and the taste, ambience and service is just great. Specifically Srinath who practically runs it is too humble and hospitable. Great service, food and ambience. Don‚Äôt miss it !"
Cafe Eclat,Rohit Kumar Gupta,13 January 2019,4,"We ordered eggs benedict and American pancakes. Liked a lot, both of them but they should also serve hash browns with the pancakes as the pancakes are small and the portion size was less. The seats were uncomfortable. They should have provided cushions in each chair, as the seats are quite deep and it doesn't provides good back support. But, food was very nice. Highly recommended!"
Cafe Eclat,Bozy Chabungbam,07 January 2019,4,Cafe eclat is a warm and cozy place which has quite a lot to offer for those who love dessert. The raspberry jam donut was good but the chocolate ganache tart wasn't really upto the expectation when one tart costs RS 150. Overall a good place to spend good time with friends for coffee but could be little over priced if the right item is not ordered
Cafe Eclat,Debangana Tarafdar,06 January 2019,5,"This place is located on the Gachibowli Highway.

I loved the ambience, food and service.

Everything we ordered was delicious. It makes for an amazing breakfast/ brunch place.

We ordered a Chicken Sausage Roll, English Lamb Panini and Spanish Omelette with Hash Browns.
We also had a Roasted Pineapple Yogurt Smoothie.

The Sausage was lovely, and I loved the dressing on the salad. The meat in the panini was extremely well cooked.

The Smoothie had a zing, and was very refreshing.

I loved Cafe Eclat, and I look forward to visit again, to try the rest of the bakery items."
Cafe Eclat,Raja Srivathsav,01 January 2019,4,"Ambience: 3.5

What I ordered?
Goat cheese and pesto sandwich (amazing taste, average pesto)

Cafe Eclat,Ankit Bishnu Dash,31 December 2018,5,"Hey friends, I visited cafe eclat on 31st December 2018 with my office colleagues and they treated us very well.

We ordered pizza, nachos, banana ginger milkshake, and many other items.

Cafe Eclat,Sweni Tolia,29 December 2018,4,Just happen to stop by this cafe on the roadside.Amazing cafe at a prime location. Food is really tasty m coffee was amazing. Little overrated n over priced.
Cafe Eclat,Amitav Mohanty,24 December 2018,5,"This place has been a favourite since it started. I remember the early days when it was building its repute. One evening, they were asking folks to try out their macaroons to get feedback. Over time, they have established themselves as an authentic place for baked items.
Their croissant is quite good. They are actually one of the few places I would trust ordering a croissant from. They also make tarts and quiches. Their pasta is quite good. Even their cinnamon roll is lovely. If you want good breads, they have a good variety, from sourdough to German rye."
Cafe Eclat,Anusha Sankar,06 December 2018,4,"I recommend their bread. A bit on the expensive side, but really good quality! We bought their wholewheat raisins and walnut bread and were really impressed."
Cafe Eclat,Sandeep Srivastava,02 December 2018,5,"Superb quality, service and ambience.. can customise their dishes, fresh bakery and healthy salad items just makes the best place for any kind of outing.."
Cafe Eclat,Aditya Kumar,26 November 2018,3,"I had visited this place on a week day. We ordered red sauce pasta and lemon drizzle. It was good, but the taste was not extraordinary, i felt this place overly priced. The cafe says that it uses all kind of organic veggies and cheese, but i felt the price they were charging was exhorbant."
Cafe Eclat,Vemulapalli Sharmista,24 November 2018,4,"Perfect location for your English Breakfast.. Everything is baked on their own and you can actually feel the taste of it.Must try the Gelato of any flavour.
Scrambled Eggs - Too good to have
Waffles-Yum
Potato wedges- Hot and Crispy"
Cafe Eclat,Sharon,20 November 2018,5,"I love their bakes! Cakes, cupcakes, croissants, gelato and everything! Their cheesecake is heavenly especially with the in house-made tart strawberry sauce on top. Special kudos to the lemon cupcakes!
I've never ordered anything savoury from them because of poor impulse control. ü§∑"
Cafe Eclat,Sudheer Bandaru,18 November 2018,5,"The only place to find best bagels or any bread for that matter. They take food so seriously to deliver the best! Our kids love this place and want to go there every weekend!!!!
Want to see more locations."
Cafe Eclat,Sainikelash Jammula,14 November 2018,5,"Excellent Place to Be and Food is very hygiene and good

A Must Visit Place."
Cafe Eclat,Sandeep Pendurthy,24 October 2018,4,"Restricted to order just eggs due to diet plan, the Spanish omelette was very well made. The selection on the menu looked tempting and the bread and dessert counter had a great variety to offer. The Coffee was good and service very efficient and warm."

Cafe Eclat,Ananya Pani,13 October 2018,2,"We ordered for a margarita pizza, a brocolli-corn puff, a spinach corn sandwich, a blueberry shake, an icy latte and few cappuccinos . Apart from the cappuccinos nothing else tasted good. The bread was hard, the puff was slathered with butter, the icy latte was tasteless. The food is extremely overpriced compared to the sub standard taste."
Cafe Eclat,Ankana Chakraborty,10 October 2018,4,"As a compulsive dessert and bread hogger, I was logically drawn towards the menu of this place. And it didn't disappoint.

If you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (It's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) Eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.

The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I've had in terms of texture. It's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.

The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.

The taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products. Keep it up."
Cafe Eclat,Deepthi Karnam,08 October 2018,4,"A small hygiene place with comfortable seating. The desserts and coffee are absolutely tasty :) we tried the Italian bread sandwich, that was yum"
Cafe Eclat,Rupak Thummala,02 October 2018,2,The food is good but not worth the huge price. Mexican bun - not good. It had a strong coffee flavor and was also a little burnt. Coffee is average. Tables and cutlery need to be cleaner.
Cafe Eclat,Saurav Srivastava,02 October 2018,4,"My wife loves the tiramisu here though priced higher than what I would have expected. We also ordered a pizza which was good given they make it fresh and you can see the whole process if you take a seat at the back. I liked the coffee, strong."
Cafe Eclat,Subhayan Foodie Basu,30 September 2018,4,"Location: Prominently located just opposite to south india shopping mall

Ambience: Simple yet funky designer interiors. Small yet comfortable sitting area.. good place for grab a coffee

Food: Ordered there spcl thin crust pizza
Which was really awesome .

Death by chocolate: its an awesome combination of choclate n cream which blow u away


Overall a good place to hang out"
Cafe Eclat,Suraj Shenoy,29 September 2018,1,"We went in as a group and it is a small place and they had to arrange the tables awkwardly. So it is definitely not a good place for groups.

The food was below par. The worst part was that the chicken starter they served was not cooked. The mushroom toast was not good too. The sandwich, burger and pizza was also below average tasting. They also didn't have bottled water.

Only good thing was the friendly service."
Cafe Eclat,Pathakastha666,25 September 2018,3,"Cafe eclat has lot of variety and their white sauce pasta is delicious. But majority of the food lacks taste, french fries lack seasoning and sandwiches are dry. Moreover, i find the place way expensive for the experience offered. I would recommend to go here for cold coffee or chocolate shake."
Cafe Eclat,Akhilesh Heda,12 September 2018,4,"Amezing place if you are looking for a relaxed time with some food and good coffee. Been there on Saturday night. The place is quite and well maintained. Staff is awesome with fast service. Tried some desserts along with sendwich and coffee , the taste was amezing.
Would say a must try place."
Cafe Eclat,Anoop Madamsetty,08 September 2018,4,Awesome breakfast place...nice ambiance...cozy..only downside is that it is very expensive..prizes could be a tad less.. service was quick..

I don't know why this is happening with this good place.this was unexpected.over all ratting

Cafe Eclat,Chhaya Sharma,01 September 2018,5,"I don't know why this place is rated 3.9, it easily qualifies for 4.2 and above.
We ordered a Farmers omlette, masala omlette, american panacake, banana ginger milkshake and a caramel coffee.

Farmers omlette was the best dish out of everything, pancakes melt in the mouth and the combination of banana and ginger just works.

I would love to come back to this place and recommend others to try out."
Cafe Eclat,Poojitha Challagali,27 August 2018,2,"Ambience - 4*

It‚Äôs a good place to hangout. But get your hands only on the items in display rather than ordering from the Menu.
Not a place for people who love spice."
Cafe Eclat,Praful,27 August 2018,1,"Update: Just wanted to make sure the cafe would know... I am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff's issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now. To make a long story short.. you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe. Now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card. My account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once, my card is blocked and i am pissed. Truly a nightmare experience, all because i choose your establisment by mistake.

Old review:
                         This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol"
Cafe Eclat,Monika Jaiswal,27 August 2018,2,Ordered chocolate croissant for dessert but ut was horrible. A cold soggy croissant was delivered which was too low in quality for 200 bucks .. over priced and over hyped restaurant..
Cafe Eclat,Amyprof,26 August 2018,5,"All time favorite place to crash where one need not think twice about your health getting damaged. Get the joy of genuine food, without additives and preservatives. Amazing variety of breads and omelettes. Thanks Eclat!"
Cafe Eclat,Abhimanyu Padmaraj,19 August 2018,5,A must visit cafe with an amazing range of cakes and gelato. They have a variety of breads to choose from along with coffee to opt. The ambience and decor are top notch. Their service is good. I will definitely visit again tho the prices of the cakes are slightly on the higher end.
Cafe Eclat,Mallika G,13 August 2018,4,This place has got the best cinammon rolls‚ù§ everything is freshly baked. I like their butter croissant too.. coffee tastes ok. Sophisticated ambience..
Cafe Eclat,Sumit Menon,08 August 2018,5,Really amazing place. Has vibrant and nice decor. Menu is really distinct and elaborate. Great people for people with sweet tooth for desserts. Even coffee is really great. Pasta is delectable too
Cafe Eclat,D,07 August 2018,4,"Very interesting choice of food, so far whatever I've tried from the cheese & tomato croissant, pastries, spaghetti, pasta to the biscuits, all have been top notch. Perhaps the quantity could be better but there's no doubting the quality."
Cafe Eclat,Ria@ Travelfoodism.com,21 July 2018,3,"Enjoyed the Mushroom & spinach sandwich, felt that it could have had more flavours to it. Chicken pasta was also ok and the side bread tasted good. Liked their idea of serving water in colourful glass bottles. Location is amazing and ambience is nice being a small cozy place to enjoy quiet meals with your family & friends."
Cafe Eclat,MVK,21 July 2018,2,"Menu here is very interesting and we went with lot of expectations. 

For starters ordered - Chicken Broccoli Melt and Stuffed Bell Peppers. 

Chicken Broccoli Melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. The plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. Luckily the chicken is not raw! Bread is very hard and difficult to eat. Overall not worth ordering. 

Stuffed Bell Peppers - Tasted just ok. But loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 

Aglio E Olio - No complaints about this one. Tasted fine. 

Cabonara Chicken Pasta - So bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 

Quattro Formaggi Pizza - It is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. So much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad. 

Overall, very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3."
Cafe Eclat,Harshad Kulkarni,16 July 2018,4,Very good italian food. It has Excellent ambience. Loved the english cottage cheese panini and pasta arbiatta. The arfagatto dessert is amazing.
Cafe Eclat,Rishav Verma,14 July 2018,5,"A simple ,comfortable yet westernized setup which I highly recommend for morning brunch or evening snacking. Its a cool place to hangout with friends or partner. It definately deserves 4.5 for the items they serve during these times of the day.
Recommendation :
1. Sour dough bread (if you are a real bread lover, and other different variety of breads)
2. Eggs/Omlette meals, Pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfast/brunch.
3. Shakes / Coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling.
4. Sandwiches(both veg/non-veg) be it all kinds comes under safe options and they result to a good takeaway.
5. Peruvian Grilled Chicken ( highly recommend)
Quiche & other small bites are also nice trials."
Cafe Eclat,Jatin,08 July 2018,1,I ordered the BBQ Chicken Panini from another delivery service and they gave me a normal sandwich with soggy bread and stale chewy chicken cooked in bad oil. If this is what they call a Panini they should probably shut down and take elementary cooking classes.
Cafe Eclat,Kiran,07 July 2018,5,"I love this place....they have an wide array of bagels, croissants, omelette. It has prefect ambience...that of a quaint English cafe... it's sparsely crowded and my preferred place for leisurely Sunday breakfast."
Cafe Eclat,Anshitaa Srivastava,02 July 2018,3,Its a decent place to have breakfast but i would rather say V.Expensive. We ordered Spanish Omelette which was not value for money. Belgian Waffles were Amazing which made us happy. But i would say an Expensive place to hv breakfast.
Cafe Eclat,Aditi Chakraborty,01 July 2018,2.5,"Nice cozy ambience, good place to have coffee with friends. Good finger food, however over priced. Chicken quiche tasted good however quantity was very small compared to price"
Cafe Eclat,Shahnaz,30 June 2018,2,Had ordered in for the night. Was really excited to see chilli con carne on the menu. It's one of my fav dishes from when I had travelled. Had also ordered 2 croissant. Was disappointed with the look and tatse of the items for the price being charged. The food had no flavour at all. The croissant looked like some Patty from a local store.
Cafe Eclat,Pallavi K,23 June 2018,1,"had heard a lot about this place but this is my worst experience in Hyderabad. ordered for chocolate elixir and it was big disappointment. thankfully the staff agreed to change it. the price for the quantity yey they serve is very high.the place wasn't clean, there were so many flies, not maintained and cleaned. wouldn't recommend it to"
Cafe Eclat,Ganaeducations,20 June 2018,1,Dont deliver from here. Cheesecake came as little almost the half of usual size of the one you get when dined. And they dont cook properly and use good ingredients for online orders. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not worth the money AT ALL
Cafe Eclat,The Foodie Bookworm,14 June 2018,4,"A posh cafe, not recommended for students.Visit only if its a treat. But food served it great just a little costly. The death by chocolate cake was an wonderful experience for me and also the carrot cake. I loved it. I had a white sauce based pasta too. But I am sorry I don't remember the exact name. It was really really good."
Cafe Eclat,Hasanthi Mula,10 June 2018,3,"As I entered I feel in love with the ambience , small but very well maintained place
Service was quick and the food tasted average
But felt overall it is overpriced as the food is offered in less quantity"
Cafe Eclat,Muzeeb Shaik,03 June 2018,5,"I visited Cafe Eclat this morning for brunch. Despite the place being full, the service was exceptional. Food tasted fresh and the ambience was lively. Would love to visit again!"
Cafe Eclat,Slo,01 June 2018,4,"This has been a good find! Almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious. Mushroom quiche though small, was filled with umami, served with caramelised onion. Their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture. I love that their bread, pasta, pizza base, etc is all made in-house with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring. This is rare, and so nice! There's also some great looking fresh breads for sale‚Äî we picked one up, wrapped in paper.

There may be room for improvement with the coffee‚Äîmaybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country?

Overall, I'd recommend Eclat over a lot of the generic so-called cafes. People complaining about the price are better off visiting a Cafe Coffee Day."
Cafe Eclat,Benazeer Khan,28 May 2018,4,"We went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a Sunday morning. We ordered spinach omelette, belgian waffles, coffee and gelato. Everything was delicious but over priced for the quantity, especially the waffles. Overall, it's a good place with happy vibes. Just a little overpriced and the portions are small."
Cafe Eclat,Sushma Chitta,19 May 2018,3,I thought this place was extremely overpriced for the taste and portions. Very small portions and not so great taste. Could have been much better! Although the presentation was good.
Cafe Eclat,Arjun,16 May 2018,4,"I loved the feel of the place as soon as I entered it. Though small but it's well maintained and gives you a cosy environment. Give the bakery items it specialises in, the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from.

The preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. I'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. The Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat are must try. Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing. The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.

I'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too. But I'd recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don't usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation. It's best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ;)"
Cafe Eclat,John Benedict,15 May 2018,4,"Came here on a hectic Monday.
Service was quick. The croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well.
I liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products. One can see the kitchen area through the windows.
The cake was neat as well and the coffee great,
This place opens at 7 AM hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 PM so makes it a great spot at all time. 
Prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it.
Will come here again for the great food."
Cafe Eclat,Ambar Chakravarty,12 May 2018,1,"They have listed themselves to feature on Zomato, but just decline every order. Terrible approach and poor customer service. I am a regular at Eclat, but never expected them to be this poor."
Cafe Eclat,Tamanna,11 May 2018,3,"Modified the rating after the second visit since there were no salads and there apple walnut Danish had more raisins than apples :( I was told that everything on their menu is out of season.

The salads here are some of the best I have eaten in Hyderabad. Unassuming place with great food, especially bakery products. Their apple walnut Danish pastry is entirely out of the world!!"
Cafe Eclat,Sai Kiran,11 May 2018,4,Bit expensive but taste wise it‚Äôs fabulous! Trust me order hot chocolate and pasta . All there coffees and food ü•ò are delicious. Looking forward to visit again thanks.
Cafe Eclat,Kamal Prakash,10 May 2018,4,"I really liked the ambience. The blue cushions complimented the tables with wooden finish. The glass doors added to the elegance. The place was very calm. I had the cheesecake here, it literally melted in my mouth, absolutely loved it. One downside is that the place is a bit expensive."
Cafe Eclat,Divya Iyer,10 May 2018,4,"The first time I had something from Cafe Eclat was when we ordered Snack-boxes for a work event. Though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.

We then went to to try out breakfast at this place. They have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of Omelettes. We ordered the Omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli Omelette. We also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. Everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. In fact, I am wondering how I let go of the Belgian waffles on their menu. The portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.

The next I visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the Rocher Caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your Ferrero Rocher, only larger. Man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 

So yes, the place is definitely pricey, but I have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. Great place with many options, so must try!"
Cafe Eclat,Ananta Ray,03 May 2018,1.5,"Went to this place couple of weeks back. Wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks. But seeing the price of pastry at 250 + GST, i decided against it. When you add Art to your tagline, everything seem to be a bit more expensive. I am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice. Not my cup of tea!

Had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average. 700 bucks for all this"
Cafe Eclat,Aditi Upadhyay,28 April 2018,3,"The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""FRESH"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing."
Cafe Eclat,Rahul Gupta,27 April 2018,4,"The place is near the Gachibowli flyover.
The ambience and decor is brilliant
I had Tiramisu here.. it was good. Though I expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu ..

You can make your own gelato in a jar here. Sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine.

I went there on a Wednesday evening and cafe was empty. Crowd must come on weekends I believe.

Prices are on the higher side but then again it‚Äôs one of the best dessert shop in the area."
Cafe Eclat,Aishwarya Dhamne,24 April 2018,3,It's a little expensive place I feel. coffee was normal nothing great about it. But blueberry cheese cake was different and good. If u visit the place then their cheese cake is a must try.
Cafe Eclat,Dheerendra Rathor,21 April 2018,4,"Went there for breakfast at 1'o clock üòõ but sad to see breakfast options being closed.
But loved the other options there, especially ""Pain au Chocolate et Hazelnut""."
Cafe Eclat,Vasanthi Raj,20 April 2018,1,"Portion size vs cost is dismal. 3 inch diameter quiche costs Rs165. Packaging charges very very high, Rs15 for a paper bag size 5.5"" by 7"". My bill of 793 was inclusive of Rs 50 packaging charges and Rs 38 GST... The entire order won't be sufficient to quell the hunger pangs of even one normal adult."
Cafe Eclat,Abhirupa Lahiri,16 April 2018,1,"I haven't tried their ala carte menu but had a slice of their cheesecake which was definitely not worth the whopping 410 bucks. It was nothing like the original cheesecake and had a strong annoying scent of cinnamon. Moreover, the portion was too meagre."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Amol Kale,15 May 2019,1,"With the kind of price they have for the buffet, I would call this as my worst buffet experience ever. The vegetarian people I had accompanied had nothing to eat at all. There was not even a single paneer starter. And for non-vegetarians, there was nothing except chicken being served.  We don't expect such food for this cost and venue."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Yogesh Kumar Gupta,15 May 2019,1,"We went for a lunch with our team, and all of us were truly disappointed with the food and the service as well. For vegans, they had just 2 starters.. the food did not had any taste, it was more like just things being mixed without any skills. Desserts were little better, but main course was completely disappointing, be it the dal makhani, which lacked consistency, or the paneer, which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy. I certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Tahishi Gupta,03 May 2019,4,"Ordered chicken biryani, chicken chilli and cheesecake . Chicken biryani was good but the cheese cake was beyond amazing. It just melted in mouth."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Hemanth Emadabathuni,30 April 2019,5,"Where to start!! This place is really awesome. Especially their hospitality, how the treat the diners is worth making a point. And this place is best when visited on a Sunday. Ambiance, food, pricing are all perfect. You should never minis their desserts as you'll not even have space for all the desserts in place. We visited this place on our friend's birthday and they surprised us with cute little cakes and birthday wishes. Will soon visit this place again."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Dinesh Naidu,29 April 2019,3,"Went for lunch buffet,little disappointed with the spread, at this cost expect little more options. Taste was okay some of the items were good others were ok ok.

Overall 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Food 3.5/5
Value for money 2/5"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Mihir Bhagwat,23 April 2019,5,"I had the pleasure of having breakfast, lunch and dinner here at various times for an entire week and I was simply amazed to experience an entirely different level of hospitality and customer delight at this place! The staff ensure that they have a great connect with all the guests and cater to even the tiniest of the guests' requirements. I tried the A-la-carte menu as well as the Buffet here and loved every bit of the food that was served. Chef Chinmay Panda, Chef Abhay Kumar Sahoo and Ms Hema were the perfect hosts every time! There was an instance when the Chef inquired about our food preferences and specially prepared French Toast and mind blowing Idiappam for us! Once they knew that we were checking out from the hotel that day, they specially got us a pastry with the words 'Bon Voyage' engraved in chocolate on the serving dish. They even took a photo with us for their archives. I was completely overwhelmed by such a warm gesture and fabulous fabulous hospitality! Best of luck to the team at Feast and hope you scale greater heights in maintaining such high level of customer service!"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Saurabh,16 April 2019,1,We visited for Sunday Dinner! Awful experience..Food was all cold without any taste..though staff was courteous and tried to compensate by good behaviour but all in vain when food is not good..
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Ankit Aggarwal,11 April 2019,4,"As the name goes it is actually a Feast to have. Starting with the food, they have a lot of variety and everything is worth tasting at least. The variety of salads is different and delicious. The main course is really good and specially the Dal Makhani. And all my rating goes to the desserts. They are plenty and you can‚Äôt get over each and every item. Definitely a place to over eat ."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Tallurimadhuri Chowdary,09 April 2019,5,"Mahesh , Hema are very good at service
should improve the spread
Taste was okay
Not great
Expected a lot from Sheraton but on the whole was fine"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Neha Aggarwal,07 April 2019,5,"One of the best buffet I have ever had. Starting with the food, there is so much variety and each and every thing was super yumm. They had lip smacking main course items. Dal makhani is simply best.
The best part is Desserts. There is so much variety , that you can't have it all and the greed for it will not satisfy.
Must try place though a little high on pocket.
And the service is also good. Loved itüòä"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Aishvarya Arora,02 April 2019,5,"Location: It has a prime location being located in the heart of Financial District beside the huge ICICI Towers.
Hospitality: Couldn't have asked for better.
Ambiance: Perfect!
Food: Now comes the real part, 
I went on a 10th of February 2019 and they were celebrating Avengers then. People in Thor & Captain America costumes with desserts all being prepared according to the theme gave us a cheerful theme to feast on. The wide spread of the food with varied cuisines and live music just made my day. Chat corner serving Pani Puri and various types of chats, Fish Poppers, Spaghetti, Biryani, Tikkas, Naan, Roti, Chicken curry and a long list of sumptuousness makes me go again. 
Frills: So on that specific day, there was a photographer who clicked everyone with the superheros and gave us a print of the same, which was such a delight.

Thanks for making the experience special.

P.S.: It was all worth"

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 March 2019,4,"Buffet is good, though expensive. Great service and well spread food range. Decent ambience. Especially try out their Sunday brunch or special buffets during festival time."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Amit,14 March 2019,4,"Standing true to its 5-star ambience, the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing. Salads, Chat, North Indian, Continental to South Indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. There was a huge section of Salads out of which Bacon salad being the pick of the lot. The Starters spread included Hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, Farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, Live chat and Pasta counters, Tawa fish, Fish fry, Chicken starters, Pork pepperoni, Sauted mushrooms, Chicken Salami, Bacon, Sausages etc.  

The Main course had Chicken Haleem which was okaish, Chicken Biryani which was good, Mutton curry where I felt the pieces were undercooked, Mirchi ka salan, Veg Biryani and some veg curries. The main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. Prawns and Crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. The desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. They had a humungous spread of sweets which included Chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, Barfis, Moong dal Halwa, Phirni, Fruit kheer etc. The pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties. Overall a decent outing experience!"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Surya Tej Kanuri,12 March 2019,4,"*one of the best brunches.. People with a sweet tooth.. You should goüëåüëç*

Food - 6/7
Ambiance - 5/7
Service - 3/7

Feast is one of the biggest spreads I saw in a buffet.. It has continental, Chinese and Indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety.. The ambiance is decent.. But Probably it could be improved..

I would like first start with the desserts section.. There are many.. The very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient.. Perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth.. A big selection of pastries, cheese cakes along with many Indian specialties..

There was chicken, fish and mutton for starters.. I couldn't see prawns.. Chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside.. The best starter of all.. The other starters are okeyish..

In the main course, chciekn biryani and Lal Maas were the best.. Overall a very good experience.. üëç

The on- table service was slow.. The only thing I hope could have been a lot better.."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Raashi Jain,11 March 2019,4,I tried the buffet dinner. Very good spread both for vegetarians and non vegetarians . The food was good and the staff were friendly too.

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,NIdhi Samdani,10 March 2019,3,My experience was not great on women's day. Too crowded maybe because of the discount and it was totally mismanaged. The desserts were of the same kind and all in pink.... Though the staff was courteous and made us sit in no time.
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Harsh J,09 March 2019,5,I had a great time here. Real good spread of food. Mahesh looked after us very well. Overall really nice experience. The desserts are excellent and curd items were very tasty

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Supreethbilla,07 March 2019,4,"Been here with family over a dinner on Thursday. After a movie was thinking about having a luxury dinner and feast hit my head. The ambience was good. The hospitality was great. Need to mention about Chef.Chimnayi and also steward Dharma for there living hospitality.

Coming to food, the spread was big with and uncountable with cuisines like Lebanese, chinese, Indian and continental. After so long I actually loved the taste of almost all items. Be it salads, starters, main course and finally my most favorite desserts.

They served 18+4 varieties of cold & hot desserts which are prepared by their own and not outsourced.
Special mention chocolate pudding, gud ki lapsi, wood fried pizza, salads, baked yogurt & pure ghee be an ladoo.

They have an amazing team to fix your mocktails and cocktails!

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Manini Nayak,02 March 2019,5,"Right from people to ambince,food everything was excellent. And specially the lamb biriyani served by chef Abhay is worth trying. It was a nice experience to have a family dinner. Looking forward to come back again. Thank you so much team sheraton for your great hospitality"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Harjeev Sabherwal,02 March 2019,4,"Tried the buffet here and was happy with the spread available. The spread was a mix of India, Chinese and Continental. Overall the food was good. The desert options available were kinda limited but the stuff was good so no complaints."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shravya Gunipudi,01 March 2019,4,"Firstly, the ambience is amazing. I like the way the whole decor is simple, yet endearing. While the building is not impressive from the outside, the set up is pretty good.

Coming to the food, the spread was lavish. Especially the desserts were amazing and are definitely the highlight of the buffet. However, we ordered mocktails which were a disappointment. Further, there were hardly any starters which was definitely something that we did not expect.

The staff was cordial and quite helpful when we needed cutlery or help with a dish.

Overall, definitely worth a visit."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Jaya Prakash,28 February 2019,4,"It was pleasant surprise brunch interms of food, huge variety desserts, biggest in Hyderabad interms of desserts and chef also so cooperative in need egg which where not there but he made it for us kudos"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Tornadointhekitchen,28 February 2019,4,"A reputable dinner at Sheraton hotel. Known for their buffet and Cheeese pesto naan. If you havent heard of it yet then you must visit them !!!

A lovely PR and gluttonous chef turn every visit into a blissful meal.

Detailed review for the lunch buffet coming up soon"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Bhaskar Rao,26 February 2019,5,Have been here for the last two days and one more to go.Honestly is feeling of home away from home.The personalised attention and warmth extended by the staff is amazing.Like to specifically mention Subhajit Maity in the ‚ÄúFeast‚Äù who has been a treat to be with..lovely human and professional.
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Saurabh Verma,25 February 2019,1,"Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
Very disappointing experience from Sheraton. I have to think about my relation with Sheraton in the future."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sujith Akshintala,25 February 2019,1,"A very good example of a very bad restaurant service! 
Sheraton was always on my top my list but Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad has changed everything.
To start with Service is so bad here, we had to beg for serving drinking water.
The quality of food is ok and fish fry was stale.
linen napkins on the table are not properly washed or might be used ones.

To sum up, the experience was terrible and not expected from Sheraton. #unhappy"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Manju Verma,25 February 2019,1,"I dont even want to beg 1 star , today for dinner we visited this place And the food sounds pretty old which they were just keep on reheating. Inspite of many varities hardly it was worth. My family got Diarrhea I had to wake up till this late night to take care of kids who are suffered with Diarrhea and all thanks to This disgusting restaurant.

Updating after 12 hours - Now we all four members are down with Diarrhea including me and keep vomiting. FEAST tats really disgusting you guys are serving stale and contaminated food on this high cost. Hate to visit ur restaurant. That was our last visit to this stale food restaurant. LOOKS ALL OF YOUR GOOD REVIEWS ARE PAID REVIEWS. MY BAD I VISITED YOU ON BASED OF ZOOMATO REVIEWS. if anyone think its a fake comment confirm with me on 9704669785."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Suzy,23 February 2019,2,"Went for the dinner buffet...was very disappointed with the service and food. The service here is really bad no one is bothered to attend you or clean ur table...have to remind 2-3 times for a single thing. The food is okay, taste is also okay ... not somthing i expect form luxury hotel. The desert section is good but not much variety cud have done better. Not worth ur money"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Aishwarya Gupta,23 February 2019,3,"I went here for a team dinner. We opted got Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but I did not like the food much. It was just okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Ambience is definitely 10/10. Maybe go for a la carte instead of Buffet. Unfortunately I do not have any pictures."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Satish,22 February 2019,1,"It was a horrible experience. Food was okayish, definitely not of 5-star hotel standard. The dinner buffet spread didn‚Äôt have variety. Place was overcrowded and the ambience was bland. But the thing that spoiled our evening was their pathetic service and attitude. There was almost zero attention to customers. You go there and sit at the table and no one even comes and serves water or anything. No one guides or provides instructions. Basically you are supposed to go and start serving yourself as if you are in some langar and not a high end restaurant. Even for the bill we had to go the counter and ask thrice. Definitely not a place to go with your special someone."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Deepa Mallick,20 February 2019,4,"The dining area is peaceful. Perfect place to have conversations over lunch. Hmm, but if you are too hungry you can totally skip the conversations :P 

Various types of salads are available, if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater :)  I went mad over the Hunan Chicken, it was just amazing. Peri Peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. 

When I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food. 

The only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. It was a bit undercooked. It was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.

Desert, I feel they can do a lot more but I can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.

Staff are really cordial and are always with a smile on their face :)"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Arundhati Gaddala,20 February 2019,5,"Lovely dinner ‚ù§Ô∏è had a great time here. We were served by Nayan this evening, who was quite polite. Enjoyed the food and service thoroughly!"

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shankar Murthy,13 February 2019,4,"Been here with a group of 35 people for food buffet.
Vert spacious dine area, peaceful ambiance. Hotel staff greats you with smile. Good number of dishes, lots of dessert options but no good ice creams flavors. Bengali sweets, palak chat, mango crumble, fresh fruit cake are must try."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shivam,11 February 2019,1,"With the name you definitely expect and hope a lot but when it comes to reality, everything fails.

I had a vegetarian buffet and the spread was limited. There was no paneer in starters which is any vegetarians heart. And when i asked if they can prepare (with the huge cost of ‚Çπ1750 involved) they couldn't.

Also the taste of other items is not upto the mark.

The only good thing i can remember is Aaloo tiki chaat.

I would recommend you to plan somewhere, even if it's a team dinner, though mine was not!

It's not even worth ‚Çπ 500 and i am definitely not going to Sheraton again!"
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Kanthareddy Poreddy,11 February 2019,4,"Went with family for Sunday brunch...very good ambience..and good service..wide spread in buffet.. especially in desserts..salads.mutton biryani was so..good.garlic burnt fried rice exlent mutton curry superb..finally sweets and ice-creams ..,üòãüòã we enjoyed all food withfresh lemon juice ...thanks to feast team"

Local in the Financial District, this place offers great Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner Buffet.

went for a Sunday brunch when they we're having the European food festival.
Inline with the festival theme they had many continental dishes.
The salads,variety of cheeses and the desserts stood out in the entire menu.
The desserts on menu were a good offering of English,Danish pastries;Gelatos;creamy macarons and Indian desserts,which included Chum Chum,Halwa among many other things.

-  Chicken Tikka - Cooked for perfection.

- Chef≈õ Special Grilled Chicken - As I was on keto, Chef specially prepared this for me. This dish was a disappointment.

- Chef≈õ special Butter Prawns - Tasted Amazing with light butter flavour.

- Keto Fish - It was completely tasteless.

- Chicken Pizza - Pizza was so huge , topped with cheese and chicken. It was absolutely delicious.

- Egg Fried Rice - Not an authentic chinese dish, but taste good.!

In drinks , we had Fresh Lime Soda and Virgin Mojito . Both of them tasted decent.

Staff were very courteous , well trained and polite."

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Vinita More,01 January 2019,3,"Went for Christmas Buffet Lunch. We were 4 of us. The staff were very friendly, courteous and cooperative. 5/5 for the service. But the food was very very disappointing. The starters were unmentionable. The chat counter, Palak Chaat was good but kanji Vada was pathetic. In Italian, we asked him to serve us ravioli, which was very hard and the worst we have had. The saving grace was the Indian counter. The curries, Biryani, bread etc. were all good. I think the restaurant should stick to Indian and not venture into other cuisines till they are better prepared to do so."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sneha Manan,31 December 2018,5,"We were a group of 10 out on a team lunch. We opted for a mix of veg and non veg buffet. The spread, right from the salads to the dips and the desserts was wide and each of the individual dishes were delectable. Do try the Dal makhni and Indian dessert options.
This is a must try place and worth the money you pay for the experience."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Namit Agarwal,31 December 2018,3,"Sheraton is one of the best hotels in Hyderabad but their restaurant fails to match the expectations.
I have come here twice for the Buffet and the only good thing was some desserts.They have very few options in Vegetarian starters.Pizza is not of the best quality whole pasta is good.
Their desserts looks mind-blowing but only few of them are actually very good.

Ambiance is pretty amazing but it's not the worth the price you pay for the kind of food you get here."

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sreejan Shrivastava,15 December 2018,2,"I visited flechazo on 13th for a team lunch. Honestly, the place is really hyped. Starters were good, main course average, and the desserts were below average. They have a live pasta counter, but it was absolutely pathetic. There was no seasoning, just plain tasteless pasta and sauce. Even the mocktails are overpriced and average. There are far better buffet places in Hyderabad where you could get amazing food for nearly half the price. Would not recommend."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Anilpaturi,14 December 2018,5,"Food was delicious and it has a large selection of food including Asian, Indian and continental. Service was great, Viroopa was very professional and did a great job in assisting."

Looking for more occasions to go this place üëå"

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Jagdeep Singh,08 December 2018,5,Have visited this place couple of times and as always their service is great and very quick. Specially their staff is very friendly and caring. Their vast buffet menu will give taste of different cuisine. Visited today for my anniversary with my parent. The service by Mr Dharma made it even great experience for them as he served their requested order very swiftly and they enjoyed the evening. Their live counter was something I loved the most. May be adding some options for veg in starter can make it better for veg folks :)
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Prashant Singh,08 December 2018,5,The food was good and tasty and the staff was friendly. Dharma from the serving staff took great efforts to make us comfortable. Dal makhani was a delight.
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Amrita Phadnis,08 December 2018,2,"I am sorry to say this but nothing, i mean nothing in this place was exceptionally good. From food, to taste, to hygiene, to the supporting staff, to the ambience - nothing just made me food good and welcomed. We were a group of people who went there and none of us were happy with the food, or the food spread, or the taste specially. I remember nothing from what I ate as extraordinarily good. I have been to westin buffet, novotel buffet, trident buffet, avasa buffet and alllllll were way way better than this place. There has been absolutely no work done on the ambience to look pretty or attractive. It also wasn't that clear like other restau. the place did not even smell good. I would never visit this place."
Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Baldo Garc√≠a,08 December 2018,4,"Very good and service from Varsha and very good service overall, they were so nice explaining local food variety and helped me choosing my meal"
Being Hungry,Dr Foodie,21 May 2019,1,I ordered paratha and kulchas from here yesterday night and out of 3 ..2 were burnt . Taste was horrible . And when we complained in zomato chat they gave 27 credit points .. as if that makes up for everything . Our order was of much more value and then we had to order again from some place else coz no one will eat burnt food like that. Horrible service by Being Hungry and Zomato . They don't take their customers seriously at all . Will never ever order from this place again nor will my friends order from here again.
Being Hungry,Vikas Shastrula,24 April 2019,5,Kaju Biriyani is AWESOME one must try this for sure. I love this most in this restaurant.Apart from this other items are also good. I strongly recommend this restaurant near Gachibowli
Being Hungry,Vijay Kumar,23 April 2019,4,This place is good for any food though the main highlight is the special biryani. Biryani lovers will happily go home tummy full. Also the chicken fried rice is a must try here.

Being Hungry,Srinivas Kiran,17 March 2019,1,I ordered a veg panner Biryani the taste was not satisfied and it was not good taste and the quality also low I am not satisfied with this quantity
Being Hungry,Pratap,05 March 2019,3,"Ordered Paneer Masala Curry and Butter Naan through Zomato. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.
Paneer masala was little bit spicy and tasted ok, paneer pieces in curry were less though. Butter Naan was soft, liked it.
Had also tried Chicken Biryani from this place, taste was ok. Biryani rice was flavourful but the rice was little undercooked."
Being Hungry,Veggie-Lover,11 February 2019,3,"Pocket friendly, sumptuous and decent quality.

This place is my goto for late night deliveries. Their Kaju Biryani is a personal favorite.

Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best.

Their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two."

We have ordered chicken lollipop, dry veg munchurian , kaju pulao,egg biryani,chicken biryani, panner biryani, chicken drumsticks,chicken 65. All starters are simply superb.I liked veg munchurian very much.coming to pulao and Biryanies, chicken items are simply superb. But in panner and kaju pulao the masala is very less. I felt like I am eating plain rice. If they would have been added little bit spices it would be great. But after that I have ordered veg munchurian dry many times."

Being Hungry,Shubhabrata Ghosh,18 August 2018,2,"I ordered Chilly Chicken and Butter Naan. The butter naan was alright but the chicken needs to improve a lot. Although the gravy was fine, the chicken was not upto the mark as it seemed tasteless. To conclude it's okay but it really needs to improve a lot on a number of points."

Being Hungry,Saumya Ranjan,15 August 2018,4,"The food was really great when I went with my office colleagues. The staff was not much supportive and made us wait a long time but as per food, the taste was great, the paneer lababdar was great. Paneer chunks were soft, the curry had all the flavours, the butter naan that I ordered, I must say , had too much butter but tasted great.

I have tried a number of their dishes, but the only one thing that stands out is their Being hungry special chicken biryani. My father has a restaurant in Delhi, and he ensures that whenever I'm travelling to Delhi, I get that biryani for him from Hyderabad. So that's the level of love my family has for this biryani.

Tempteys,Aditi Bhaiji,30 April 2019,4,"I go to the onsite shop and have some shakes there. They are too delicious üòã
I would rate there service as 4.5/5 , food as 4.5/5 , ambience as 4.5/5 .
I very much like the idea of writing the reviews on the wall, inside the shop itself."
Tempteys,Buddiga Sindhuri,17 April 2019,3,This tempteys is just near dlf building I drank choco brownie its yum to drink its orea n brownie mixture and its around 189rs.my friend drank mango shake its having essence taste rather than mango taste and it is around 145rs.i expected mangoes but no mangoes are their in that shake and its little disappointing.They write some note on the sticky notes and stick it to the wall.The ambience is good and enough space for parking too.
Tempteys,Paul Davies,13 April 2019,5,Great shakes.....I tried marshmallow and mint Oreo for the first time here....both were pretty good....but I would prefer the mint Oreo...but that's just me....Best spot for shakes in the DLF area....Check it out....
Tempteys,Sahithi Anchuri,11 April 2019,5,"We have ordered from this place and it has some amazing choices we could choose from. It has an option of gelato and avalanche for the base and I have choosen gelato.

Must try : Premium forest berry shake, caramel brownie shake, Peri Peri fries.

The shakes are super yummy and I had my best shakes here. I will definitely try some more shakes."
Tempteys,Prachita Jayaswal,01 April 2019,5,Awesome shakes. Make your own shake is the best where I can choose from variety of options which the shake should be made of. The service is pretty fast. You can write your feedback/review on sticky notes and stick on the glass window and door.
Tempteys,Akasi Mahesh,28 March 2019,4,nice and good quality but my details not mentioned
Tempteys,Anuj Malaiya,28 March 2019,3,"Ordered potato wedges, and I found them very tasty and crispyü§ó served with salsa sauce and mayo, althought I beleive that packaging can be improved a lot."
Tempteys,Siva Kumar,12 February 2019,4,"Drinks(4.5/5)- I think Tempteys and MOM rule the shakes world in terms of multiple outlets on Hyderabad.
Look out for little app/nearbuy for offers .
Shakes are good, chilly and refreshing.
My personal favorite being Oreo Shake.

Ambience-(3.5/5) The place is cool, can hangout and can have quality talk, as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways.

One thing, they should at least keep the tables CLEAN. There were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.

Service-(4/5) They know their work, prepare the shakes well. One suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.
Wonder what u add in Shakes!!"
Tempteys,Lokesh,07 February 2019,4,After a very long time had one of the best shakes when compared with nearby thick shakes this is lot better to enjoy better taste and this makes feel that this is what the shake is meant to be like
Tempteys,Neeraj Raj,06 February 2019,2,not that great taste it quality id say
Tempteys,SONIYA SINHA,16 November 2018,3,Ordered a butterscotch thick shake for home delivery. Good consistency but too sweet to finish the full glass. Will definitely try other shakes.
Tempteys,AnuraagKiran,14 November 2018,5,"We went in at 1am and yet its open. Ordered Custard Maple shake, crushed almonds shake, choco brownie shake and potato wedges. The shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing. They have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt, toblerone to local chocolates of India. The containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality.
There are only two snack items available French Fries and Potato wedges and I feel being such a franchise they should have added more options. But the variety of toppings given makes good sense.
Overall, I liked the quality of milk shakes."
Tempteys,Karishma Bhatt,23 October 2018,3,"Since i am not an ice cream lover, still i ordered oreo brownie thick shake. The shake was good enough. Need to improve packing while delivery.
Price - 3.5/5
Delivery - 5/5
Taste - 3/5"
Tempteys,Sae Da,15 October 2018,4,"Nice place, food is awesome
Tried 4 milkshakes and one ice tea
-cheese cake
-merry berry
-choco coffee hut
-forest berry and
-passion fruit ice tea
I really enjoyed them all! üëç And also the cheesy fries were really nice!"
Tempteys,Rinkal Mistry,14 October 2018,5,Very smooth delivery and timing. Happy with the service :)
Tempteys,Vikas,12 October 2018,5,"Hyderabad has been a place for food variety, I recently tried a dosa near by and today it was some drink I guess that tempted meüòâ.
A bright drink for a bright day!! yeah!! it's bright orange üòé .. #Namesuitsthedrink#"
Tempteys,Junaid Ahmed,08 October 2018,3,"Caramel Brownie was the best I could grab here and I strongly recommend the same...

When it comes to snacks they have potato wedges and french fries with multiple flavors...

A decent outlet that can accommodate around 12 visitors.. pretty clean and pleasant ambiance...

The service could ha e been a little better, I always look out for friendlg staffs !"
Tempteys,Sivram Padhy,07 October 2018,5,Perfect Taste... satisfied to the brim.. Zomato delivery is super impressive üòâ
Tempteys,Aviraj Chatterjee,07 October 2018,1,"Hey guys, your resturant sucks big time. If you guys cant deliver then put a big lock on your store. But please dont cancel after 2 whole hrs after confirming the order in 5 minutes. Never gonna order ever and will advice same to others. wish i could give a zero rating, dont deserve to be 4.4."
Tempteys,Ankit,06 October 2018,4,"I had ordered Choco Brownie Shake and it was delicious. The quantity and packaging were great, and delivery was prompt as well. Gelato base goes well with the thickshakes."
Tempteys,That Biryani Gal,06 October 2018,4,"Couldn't help but indulge my sweettooth in this store located in the Dlf lane. India's first to introduce Gelato as base of their shakes. You can choose your base between gelato or avalanche, which is basically yogurt based icecream.
New menu is interesting. Happy to see savoury items on the menu as well.

Tried Coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. It's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.

Caramel Brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. Would give a 5 just for this. Probably the best caramel shake I ever had. Total yumminess. Even the colour is drool worthy. A must try here. Yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. Some pampering for your sweet tooth.

Peri peri fries - how interesting is it to get options for your fries, when you even love them as such. I opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy

Tried crushers passion fruit flavour which was okayish"
Tempteys,Rajeev Reddy,04 October 2018,5,"Definitely a good place for the milkshakes and some munchies.

Personally i liked choco coffee hut and crunchy almond feast and the milkshakes feel so good with french fries and potato wedges.

Service is so friendly and quick, even the place feels so comfortable just go and grab a shake to get your self relaxed."
Tempteys,Akhil Nalamala,04 October 2018,5,"Great shakes are kind of a given when it comes to Tempteys, and this branch is no different. Delicious shakes, tried the Coffee Hazelnut, Merry Cherry, and Cheesecake flavours. Merry Cherry was my favourite of the lot.
What I did not expect were the amazing fries and wedges, we absolutely cleaned the boxes out.
Service was also impeccable, really quick."
Tempteys,Hussain Abbas,04 October 2018,5,"Beside the Radisson hotel lane is one of the best Tempteys outlets I have been to. I might have to get my sugar tooth removed after such sweetness overload.

The service is fast, even with constant incoming swiggy orders the staff managed to serve the ala carte customers quickly too.

Must have are the newly introduced Forest Berry milkshake and the Choco coffee hut.

Definitely a good place to drop by for well made milkshakes and fries/wedges in Gachibowli area."
Tempteys,Prince Mandal,04 October 2018,5,Great place and ambience. Loved the varieties in shakes. One of my personal favourites to choose from. Even the quality of shakes are very good. Order any time. 10 /10.
Tempteys,Varaprasad,22 September 2018,5,tempteys is better than every other milkshake brand
Tempteys,Rameez Siddiqui,20 September 2018,5,"Its a cozy place in gachibowli with the most awesome variety of milkshake and thickshakes.
The best thing about them is that they use their own brand Gelato ice cream which is particularly on the healthy side.
Had the pleasure of tasting the new menu a couple of days back
The poppy corn was a nice change of pace
The cookie caramel flavoured were my personal favorite.
Highly recommend this place to everyone!"
Tempteys,Asad Rana,19 September 2018,4,"Sunday afternoon we visited this place with the bunch of foodies to experience their new menu which has been added recently. Small outlet with around 15 people can be accommodated at a time.

Coming to the delicacy,
Classic shakes - Poppy cherry and merry cherry were the two shakes which have tried. Poppy cherry was just like butter popcorn shake was decent. Merry cherry was simply outstanding and loved it.
Premium shakes - Cruncy blue berry & Caramel brownie were my favorites. These are the must tried shakes at this place.
Exclusive shake - Coffee hazlenut and cookie feast were delicious too. Cheesecake was decent nothing that great.
Crushers - Orange bright, Poppy corn, mint cucumber are some of the crushers which we tried but all were ok.
Fries - Peri Peri Fries and Cajun spice fries were really outstanding and loved it.
Potato wedges - this one was decent with Jamaican dips.

Overall there new menu is quite a hit and have some amazing exclusive and premium shake which is not too heavy on the pocket and tasty at the same time. As we were invited here by management for the new menu session but will visit again for sure in future to taste other shakes and delicacies.

Must try dish üåü
Merry cherry
Caramel brownie
Cookie feast
Peri Peri fries"
Tempteys,Neha Patnaik,19 September 2018,4,"A Sunday afternoon and desserts, definitely makes an awesome combination added to which I had piri piri flavoured Potato wedges and french fries. All under one roof which makes Temptys different from rest.

I in a group of 8 landed this Sunday afternoon to relish their newly added shakes and flavoured snacks.

We were served with Poppy Corn & Merry Cherry as a part of their classic shakes, Caramel Brownie, Crunchy Blue & Berry, Mint o fruit from their premium shakes, Coffee Hazelnut & Cookie feast from their Exclusive shakes and Minty Cucumber, poppycorn and blue and berry from their slush sections.

The perfect shakes were: Poppy Corn, Caramel Brownie and Crunchy Blue & Berry. Poppy corn just took my heartaway. The perfect aroma of corn and it was an add on to this autumn. Caramel Brownie will definitely be favourites to all the chocolate and brownie lovers. Honestly, blue berry flavoured desserts have become my one of the favourite pick in desserts lately.

These are must trial from here. I have never come across any shake which such an amazing variety flavoured taste.

The snacks behaves cherry on the top with piri piri flavour. Someone once said you eat food first with your eyes then with nose and finally you get to taste it. These snacks surpasses everything. The potato wedges and french fries were crispy and had the exemplary colour.

Worth a visit for their special add ons in the menu.

Overall: 4/5

Food: 4/5

Sevice: 5/5

Tempteys,Swati Nandy,19 September 2018,4,"The Caramel Brownie was one of my favorites. The taste of sweet caramel alongwith the brownies was a perfect combination. When there is too much of sweet, you definitely need some savory. So we had some french fries. Although the sauce on top wasn‚Äôt that great the fries were spicy and awesome. ...

Tempteys,Sugandha Saxena,17 September 2018,4,"Tempteys recently revamped their menu, and we got a chance to try the additions at their Gachibowli outlet. This outlet is a mere walking distance away from DLF, and easily locatable in the building next to Vijaya Bank.

All their shakes come with the options of 2 bases Gelato (icecream) and Avalanche (yoghurt). Here's a list of the new ones, and how they fared.

Poppy corn: It looks quite plain, but one sip, and you'll be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake.
Merry cherry and Crunchy Forest Berry are for those who love the berries.
If you're a Mint enthusiast, do try the Mint o Fruit shake.
For those who can't get enough of cookie shakes, Cookie Feast comes in with Oreo and Little Hearts stacked on the top.
Coffee addicts can try the very appealing Coffee Hazelnut, which was absolutely a pretty sight too!
My personal favourite, though, was Caramel Brownie. The flavour of caramel, with chewy chunks of brownie, and a topping of whipped cream üòç heavenly!
Another good one was the Cheese Cake shake. It felt like a fruit cake, blended into a shake, and is good if you enjoy that flavour.
There's a whole set of flavours of slushies as well.

Just in case, it gets too sweet, they have French Fries and Potato Wedges, available in a total of 8 flavours. They come in cute little boxes, that you can probably carry away too! We tried and absolutely loved the Chilli Garlic, Real White cheese, and Cajun Spice flavours.
At 89 bucks, they're quite good to be honest.
Do give them a try whenever you're around!

~By invite."
Tempteys,Forever_fooodie,17 September 2018,4,"What I love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

Tried:

poppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.

berry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.
caramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
Cheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.
Blueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

Mint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.

They have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.

Cheers.!!"
Tempteys,Kajal Arora,15 September 2018,5,Choco-brownie is definitely a must try
Tempteys,Srinu Jangam,14 September 2018,3,"nice milkshakes but loosing its quality since the inception. i feel artificial flavors dominate shakes. good ambience, nice staff. 

Ambience: 4/5

Tempteys,Yum Yum YUMMY !,04 September 2018,4,"Overall Experience - 3.5/5
Seating - 4/5
Taste - 4/5
Service - 3/5 ( slow )
Quality -2/5 ( quality was good but There was a plastic cover piece in my shake )
Value for money - 4/5

I tried almost every shake here . I liked the Raspberry Gelato base , Mango Moon Shake , Sithaphal flavoured Shake. Oreo , Lichi were average in taste. I found a plastic cover in my shake while drinking ( thats why 2/5 ).

I‚Äôm a regular customer of Tempteys and I will be :) ."
Tempteys,Soudip Paul,01 September 2018,3,"This was the first time I ordered from Tempteys looking at the reviews and their descriptions of food preparation. I ordered Choco Brownie shake with choco chips as extra toppings, but it was average in taste, not that good what I expected. So for me my first experience was average for the taste of the shake."
Tempteys,Prashant Nair,01 September 2018,4,"A cozy little place to chill out for young buddies.. Sink into the lounge chairs with your favourite shakes, creams and flavours.  Could be a delightful menu for kids as well."
Tempteys,Shivam Khandelwal,31 August 2018,5,"Tempteys is one of the place I have visited quite regularly. Thanks to their nice service and long opening hours. The variety on the thick shakes is amazing and the every next you try feels better then the previous. I like the concept of putting sticky notes all around the walls with comments they received from the customers. The song collection which they play in background has never disappointed me as well.

I would really recommend ""Banana Strawberry"" shake out of all, which has best ratio of sweetness and taste according to me."
Tempteys,Risheel K,31 August 2018,1,"I haven't got the quality what I payed for.
not worth it.
I have ordered lichi shake with risens add-on but didn't add any risens and lichi shake contain barely any lichi in it."
Tempteys,Akansha Satyam,29 August 2018,3,Usually I order the same shake from this place it used to be so good. Today I felt that the whipped cream being added had very bad smell and taste. Couldn't finish even half of it.
Tempteys,Vineet Ramrakhiany,19 August 2018,4,I ordered the Oreo Shake and the Ferrero Rocher Shake. It was really thick and the taste was amazing. Keep up the good work. I faced just one issue and that was the absence of a straw in my home delivery order which made it difficult for me to enjoy it more delightfully. I insist the management to keep a check on this henceforth. Great shakes nevertheless.
Tempteys,Smrati Saxena,19 August 2018,4,nice interior with really good shakes. its a good place to hangout with your friends. price is quite high but the product is worth it. staff is also very friendly
Tempteys,Bhagavan Swaroop Pentapati,15 August 2018,5,good

Tempteys,Raunaq,03 August 2018,5,"One of my favourites. This place is just amazing. Take any shake and you won't be disappointed.
Tempteys actually justifies it's name.
I really hope the quality remains the same."
Tempteys,Sharath Chandu,30 July 2018,1,No cornflakes which i ordered specifically
Tempteys,Sudeepta Ghadei,30 July 2018,4,Tempteys has never disappointed with its wide varities in milk shakes. Love its ambience. Tried Mr. Cake Fruitti which was a big thumbs up! One should definitely try out this & will surely fall in love with this amazing milk shake! Also tried Crunchy Orange that did not meet my expectation. Crunchy Almond Feast is also a good one.
Tempteys,Naveenkumar,29 July 2018,5,Great
Tempteys,Amlan Sahoo,29 July 2018,5,As usual. The best shakes in the city.

Tempteys,Pallavi Tiwary ( FoodLicks),27 July 2018,5,"Tempteys is my favourite place for shakes.. Its a place which makes me little nostalgic as I have some very happy moments attached with this place. Just a glass of shake from Tempteys and it automatically lifts my mood. Every shake has its flavour. Sometimes its so hard for me to settle on one and I just wish I cud drink them all. Name any and its there.. Naughty nutella, FerreroRocher , kitkat shake, Oreo shake, Toblerone, choco brownie, berry berry blast and what not.. The only word for this place is ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù and it speaks all. :) The only thing I wish from this place is that they lessen the cost a bit .Its a bit on the higher side ."
Tempteys,Soumi Home Roy,25 July 2018,1,Too sweet and artificial in taste.

Tempteys,Madhur,10 July 2018,5,"A paradise for those who have a sweet tooth. Tempteys makes ice cream shakes so awesome that it sweeps you off your feet.

Although they have a bit of cramp seating space, yet sometimes the wait is just worth. They make really thick ice-cream shakes which are all worth trying. Naughty nuttela is a recommendation from my side.

Head there for a late night treat with your gang and you are sure to wrap up the day on a happy note."

The service of this place is appreciated

Tempteys,Kriti,28 June 2018,4,The Oreo shake was a bit of a disappointment but the Brownie shake as always lived up to expectations.
Tempteys,Epicurean Tales,27 June 2018,4,"This place is located close to the Hotel Radisson [ 5 minutes walk ] where I was staying, so I choose this place to meet a friend. It has got a nice decor and the seating was very comfortable and relaxed. We were the only customers inside this place during our one hour stay.

I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.

On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.

Tempteys,Ritesh Jaiswal,23 June 2018,4,"Their shakes are really good. I tried the Chocolate Munchy Stake. If you like Munch / Perk in your shake, you'd like it. The ambience is also pretty cool. Unlike other shake shops, these guys have a lot of items on their menu."
Tempteys,Kranthi Teja,20 June 2018,1,I paid for extra Choco chips..and I didn't even find single chin inside..it's so disgusting. I have already mentioned in instructions like..please don't forget add ons.stll they forgot
Tempteys,Amlan Sahoo,18 June 2018,4,"Ordered Mango Moon. The taste should have been proportional. It felt more like yoghurt and less mango.
It‚Äôs a problem with any Avanlanche base shake from Tempteys. Otherwise Gelato base shakes have always been good."
Tempteys,Surya Tej,18 June 2018,2,I don‚Äôt feel the taste of flavour that had ordered
Tempteys,Pyla Deepti,17 June 2018,5,always awesome
Tempteys,Mani Kumar Mengarthi,16 June 2018,2,I got both Same products
KS Bakers,Shalu,24 May 2019,2,Just Average. Ordered some 7-8 times. They could definitely improve on the food quality they deliver. Food quality is always below average. Fast food is Terrible here. They don't know how to make fast foods. Pastries could be considered.
KS Bakers,Sravya,13 May 2019,5,very good and had ultimate taste of the cake. It was too good and my friend was so happy for her birthday cake which was so tasty and yummy. The packing and quantity is also too good The delivery boy was also polite
KS Bakers,Abu Bakker Siddik,11 May 2019,1,"I had ordered 5 chicken tikka burger from KS bakes. The burger was super sweet, something one would not expect from a chicken tikka burger. Also the chicken was not cooked well, and didint seem tikka pieces any way. The bread was sweet and had a sweet fragrance to it. I don't know if it's their speciality to serve sweet burgers, but I didn't liked it a bit. It was my 1st burger order from K s bakes and I would not recommend anyone to order burgers from there. Not sure if it was a one off thing but all the burgers were sweet. üòÖ Quantity was good though."
KS Bakers,Trendy Foodie,04 April 2019,3,I ordered veg samosas and egg puffs from this outlet. Samosa for some reason had kabuli chana in it although taste was fine. Egg puffs were stale and not so good in taste.
KS Bakers,Saraswati Jeswani,15 March 2019,5,Awsome food at very reasonable price. Must try Masala French Fries.. Beeesssttt fries.. Try Kitkat pastry and Oreo Pastry. Best taste food..
KS Bakers,Arpit Kumar Jain,12 March 2019,1,"I ordered Paneer cheese pizza and veg boat from here. Both were pathetic. They don't know how to make pizza.
It was smelling bad and taste was really shitty. Plus there was no seasoning."
KS Bakers,Samashrita Beeram,23 February 2019,2,Ordered a veg cheese grilled sandwich and a veg burger with extra cheese.. Inspite of cheese it was lot of mayonnaise with awful taste.. the sandwich‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt even proper and thee food was stale.. never will try the place again.. couldn‚Äôt have the food more than a bite
KS Bakers,Nillu,10 February 2019,5,I have visited several times for cake . Here you will varieties of cake as well different kind size also ..... and test of the cake also awesome ....
KS Bakers,Johan Clive Ramos,05 February 2019,3,"KS Bakers stick to the tried and tested spread of options - pastries and quick snacks. They have a wide variety of baked pastries and burgers along with cakes too.

Their space in Gachibowli is quite roomy yet simple. On the whole, a must visit if you want to receive quick service and decent food."
KS Bakers,Yash Sheth,31 January 2019,4,"I really like this place for its pastries, cakes and biscuits. I see it a real competition to other bakery in the area. My favourites are bournvita cookies and pastries and also choco almond pastery. I would personally feel that their fast food or snacks could be improved in taste and the way it is served. Also I personally do not like it self service scheme here. This does not mske you feel privileged as you feel when you are entering the shop. Also, its announcement system is too bad. Makes you feel like on a railway station. Hence stars cut as these are part of ambience.

Overall the products are good and one can always try them. Prices are midway and therefore acceptable."
KS Bakers,Khushboo Pandey,02 January 2019,5,"Quallity- 5/5: They have a special taste, a special cream which makes it better, burger and sandwich are a must try
Quantity- 5/5: 
Ambience:3/5- from there side they have arranged but i think because of rush , the tables would mostly be dirty other things are good
Value for money: 6/5, ofcourse it is a value that big burger with 50 rupees is a steal."
KS Bakers,Satish Ch,29 December 2018,5,"ordered veg hot mexican pizza, Blueberry pastry, Butterscotch pastry from KS bakers.
Both the pastries were too good and coming to pizza it didn't had much toppings even though taste was good...and all the items were very well packed.Received potato chips though not given in the order...seems like its complimentary."
KS Bakers,Sai Krishna,25 December 2018,5,Ordered paneer tikka pizza through swiggy...what a taste!!!!! Yummy..Thank u ksbakers..better order 1 pizza for two people.their pizza size is big
KS Bakers,Asraahmad22,25 November 2018,3,"A decent bakery with a ready-made cake delivery option at short notice, which has come to rescue many times.
Their chocolate truffle cake is pretty good."
KS Bakers,Rajendra Varma,25 November 2018,4,"Ks bakers is the best place for getting or for etting pizza.
They are providing the nice pizza .
They taste well and good so everyone can try that pizza's ."
KS Bakers,Himakar Yv,20 October 2018,3,"A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets. The lighting & ambience is warm . I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks . A burger costs only 70. Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery. You get free chips with everything you order .
But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird & about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado."
KS Bakers,Sunny Daniel,15 October 2018,4,KS Baker's is good for their burgers. Bread is very soft and prices are very reasonable. Cakes and cookies which is get here are great. Good place to go for the evening snacks
KS Bakers,Kiran,09 October 2018,5,KS Bakers has several branches in Hyderabad and I visited Gachibowli branch. It was good place to visit on weekends with friends or family and food was awesome. I ordered several times from this Bakers and every time the food was as expected.Overall food was tasty and it is budget friendly.
KS Bakers,Akhil Rao,01 October 2018,4,"I often visit this place. It does offer good food and seating.

The expense to satisfaction ratio is good. One can always kill their hunger here without burning a hole in your pocket.

Amidst all the fancy food establishments with their over priced items, KS Bakers does stand out. It offers good food at relatively low prices. The place is never too crowded, so one can always manage to find a seat on the first floor.

I had their Chicken pizza, chocolate milkshake, red velvet pastry and all varieties of their chicken burgers, not one is disappointing. All the items taste good. I might specially praise their chicken cheese burger because that is my all time favorite.
They have to improve in the milkshakes department."
KS Bakers,Aasma Claudius,27 September 2018,4,"Ordered their Joy cake for my friend's birthday. The cake was sufficient for a group of 7-8 people. The flavour was really good for the price.

Also tried their mini chicken pizza and the chicken burger.
The flavour was good but the pizza was a little too dry.

Cake - 5/5
Mini Chicken pizza - 3/5
Chicken burger -4/5"

KS Bakers,SONIYA SINHA,21 July 2018,3,"Visited them on Friday eve, it‚Äôs a two-story store but still seemed over crowded. Guess they are short of staff as required during peak hours.

The bakery offers a set of beautifully decorated colorful cakes, not sure of the taste though. We had a chocolate pastry, veg n chicken puff. Fresh stuff at pocket friendly prices."
KS Bakers,Sayantan Banerjee,20 July 2018,5,"One of the best Baker shops in the city. I tasted several üç∞ from this place and every time it met my expectations. I also order grilled chicken sandwich, chicken burger, egg puff from here. Every time foods were yummy.

KS Bakers,Kishan Mallik,16 July 2018,5,"I wouldn't mind eating shorteats from KS Bakers for all the 3 meals of the day. Just amazing taste and it never changes. Their chicken 65, chicken spicy pizza and the pineapple pastry are my most favourite :)"
KS Bakers,Nancharla Lavanya,15 July 2018,5,"Came with family here and went to first floor , after 10 minutes of sitting we got to know that it's self service restaurant.üôÑ

After that we have ordered Tikka chicken and chicken üçï..

Good taste üòã.
Tasted Roll of chicken . It's hard but taste wise it's okayish.

Pastries were cool here .
Forest pastry was good .
Some other pastry I didn't remember that name but it's amazing üòãüòã.

Smooth visit for me and my family.."
KS Bakers,Brendon Lobo,15 July 2018,1,Incompetent people working here. Nobody was there to take my order for 10 mins. Then instead of packing two items they packed only one. Loss for me. And there were bones in the chicken meat used in the burger and the pizza bun.
KS Bakers,Msrinuhyd,11 July 2018,1,"Bad experience, I have ordered for cake a day before my wife birthday

committed to deliver between 11 am to 1 PM , requested them to send the cake bit early, but strictly said , they cannot deliver before

After 1 PM when i call them the status ,they said it will take some time and not even delivered , as i have other commitments on that day , i cannot wait at home till they deliver , when i ask them to cancel order they said its not possible

Taste may be good (not sure) but service is worst"
KS Bakers,Karishma Bhatt,07 July 2018,3,"Obviously, Cakes are special. Every birthday, every celebration ends with something sweet, a cake, and people remember.Not a very wow experience with Ksbakers Gachibowli . I liked very few items from their menu. Try Litchi & Dark choclate cakes.
Food - 3/5
Price - 3.5 /5"
KS Bakers,Clem,04 July 2018,2,"I ate : butter chicken burger, paneer tikka roll.

The burger was disgusting. The patty had a weird cloying, sweet taste, and the mayo made it worse.

The paneer tikka roll was nice and crispy on the outside, but the paneer was very dry. Almost like rubber."
KS Bakers,Robinu Rose Mathew,14 June 2018,1,"A week back, I ordered a black forest cake from KS Bakers Gachibowli. All excitement died after the first bite. It was for the first time in my life (after tasting black forest cake a zillion times before) that I tasted a black forest cake with a strong lingering elachi flavour. After reading a previous review mentioning this same issue, I thought that the suggestion was taken and improvement/change would have been done. I am sorry to say that the situation of the black forest cake remains the same. I would recommend everyone NOT to try the black forest cake from KS Bakers. It is a true disappointment."
KS Bakers,Prashanth Lucky,10 June 2018,5,"Hi . I got cake from here which called some joy cake chocolate.

Very good and delicioasa. Superb taste..Would recommend to anyone

KS Bakers,Trishna M,27 April 2018,2,"So, we had a combined birthday celebration for almost five people and housing a team of almost 50. We decided to order cake from KS Baker's. Following is my experience on the same-:

Presentation- Looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water. The colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white. The presentation was superb. 4/5

Delivery- Got everything delivered on time. Nothing outstanding. 3.5/5

Cake- Now this is what was actually not good enough. The black forest tasted much different than any other black forest.

Black Forest Cake- A really huge cake for a good number of people. It tasted exactly like elaichi and nowhere like black forest. A damp squib. 1/5

Will I order from here again? The cake was a turn off but I would like to give them another chance because of the reviews I have read."
KS Bakers,Kanishka Sarkar,02 April 2018,2,"I had heard a lot about their chain of bakeries and had tried there muffins before, all were good. So thought of trying their other bakes. So I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich through swiggy and upon receiving the order I found it was grilled chocolate sandwich, even bill was wrong. Raised a complaint and got a replacement. This time I checked the bill which was correct but even then THE ITEM WAS WRONG. They sent veg instead. The sandwiches were not bad(1 star extra for that) but I don't know how they can mess up like this."
KS Bakers,Parijat Ray,12 March 2018,3.5,Nice pocket friendly place. Burgers and sandwiches are tasty and value for money. The have a wide variety of different pastries. The upper section is very nice to spend time chatting and munching.
KS Bakers,Arvind Varma,11 March 2018,4,"A good place to hang out for a casual evening time. The food items are good, not too great and definitely not bad at all. We tried the chicken grilled sandwich which was the best. The paneer and chicken puff were not good. The chicken thikka roll was good. So except the puffs I feel rest all are great."
KS Bakers,Shravya Gunipudi,08 March 2018,4.5,"Loved the bakery and their innovative ticker system. Good food. Fresh and tasty.

The ambience is a bit too old and seems a little unkempt. Scope for improvement for sure.

Definite recommendation."
KS Bakers,Sandeep Kumar,01 February 2018,5,"I have ordered a cake suggested by Mr.Rajesh flavour name MANGO PASSION FRUIT I have clearly mentioned that the occasion was very special, Guys after tasting it everyone liked the amazing taste of it including kids to adults.

KS Bakers,Aanshul Sadaria,02 January 2018,3.5,"Well, all the time I have ordered here it has been Veg Corn Burger and Paneer Cheese Roll.
They are too sweet to be considered as fast foods.
The pastery I tried once was over moist. Don't know why but I guess the refrigerator wasn't working well.

The have a really good value for money. But I have seen that they don't make burgers and rolls at that time. They simply defrost the frozen food in the microwave and put in some mayo and sauce and give it.

Quality: 3/5
Quantity: 4/5
Ambience: 3/5 Nothing extra ordinary.
Value for money: 4.5/5"

KS Bakers,Vikas Polisetty,18 November 2017,3,"I had visited this places multiple times and tried a wide variety of items here.
But once I had a burger here which was a disaster, they made it with sweet buns, the veg burger was full of bolied potato and the chicken burger wasn't good either. I barely could finish half of it because the buns were too sweet.
But pizzas and sandwiches always tasted good
It's high time to re work on their burger receipe."

Parnik Kumar Gaurav"
KS Bakers,Ankit Anand,16 October 2017,4,"This is a very good place for cakes, bakery items and snacks. One can spend good time with friends here. It's a quick solution for surprise cake cuttings and birthday celebrations as cakes and snacks are readily available. Price is also reasonable."

Ordered Veg hot dogs,
Premium butter scotch pastry,
Italian chocolate pastry,
Veg hot dog, stuffed with Aloo, onions , tomato slices and mayonnaise , tastes good.
Pastries are also worth a try.

Overall ok."
KS Bakers,Nikita Kumari,18 August 2017,3.5,Ordered chicken and cheese burger and egg puff from here. The burger was nice with an overload of cheese. Really liked the packaging. Egg puff was also tasty. A decent bakery with some good food and affordable prices.
KS Bakers,Kumar Anshul,14 August 2017,3.5,"The burger was just decent but complete value for money at 75 bucks! The ""Premium"" Butterscotch pastry was a letdown though. Also ordered ""Tangdi Kabab"" and found it decent.

This place's USP is value for money. The rates are really nominal & easy on pocket."
KS Bakers,Sam Giri,21 July 2017,4,We ordered the chicken sandwich and chicken burger. The taste was quite nice. This place specially good for quick eatings. The best part is that they don't stuff too much mayonise in the sandwich.
KS Bakers,Nishtha Chandarana,21 July 2017,1.5,"This bakery is located at very prime location in Indranagar , Gachhibowli as many of good restaurants are located in same lane.. It is the center of attraction for food..Have heard many people so finally decided to visit this place..While I enter into the bakery the baking smell made me more hungry..I have ordered paneer burger and aloo tikki burger..After giving my order I thought to see what kind of bakery products they have..while I was at muffins rack, I saw the muffins and there was white fungus was on top of it..Very disappointing..They should change their show case items..
Then I got my order..Aloo burger was good but paneer burger was horrible..it was too spicy and only red chilly powder was dusted with mayonnaise..And mayo was too sweet..I was not happy with service as they have numbers of chain in Hyderabad then atlist they should maintain the quality.."
KS Bakers,Manmeet Kaur,17 July 2017,4.5,Very Impressed by the Batman Cake they delivered. Though I was never a fan of their stuff(except the cookies) but the cake was made with sheer perfection as you can see in the pic. They very calmly listened to our requirements with a budget friendly deal whereas the other famous outlets denied for customized cakes and charged a lot. Happy customer üòä
KS Bakers,Aditya Arora,09 July 2017,1.5,"I ordered mini veg pizza, manchuria, veg hot dog , veg pizza bun... Machuria was good but it wasnt hot they just gave what was kept there, veg pizza was kind of nice but it has to be more crispy, veg pizza bun and filling inside was smelling worst as if its life span is over, veg hot dog was bad it was having same filling as bun... It was totally a bad experience and over that the A.C was not at all working.... Please improve the quality"
KS Bakers,Sonofepicurus,08 July 2017,3.5,It's a good option but the bread they use for hot dogs and burgers is something which has to be improved. Burgers buns are too thick and the patty and filling at times is way too oily. They have pretty good dining area too on the first floor. The place is neat and service is pretty fast. Being an old brand catering to twin cities this place has always been a good option to grab some quick bites and lip smacking pastries.
KS Bakers,Jaythebestofme J,06 July 2017,4,"Our desi answer to the American Mc-donalds and Kfc. Value for money proposition. And it's got the desi zing to it. Be it there chicken burger or Tandoori chicken leg, everything is worth a try."
KS Bakers,Siddharth Jaligama,02 July 2017,3.5,"Neat and clean ambiance. Small place but it's worth a visit. I took snack boxes from here for an office event. Try muffins, they were of amazing taste which was liked by almost 200people in my team.
On time Delivery dint happened for me which was little disappointing but rest all was perfect ."
KS Bakers,Chandann Reddy,17 June 2017,3,Had ordered rolls and puffs from here. Extremely average or below quality. Thou the packing was neat and all but the food inside was so so... give Thee coz they are pocket friendly
KS Bakers,Nalin Venkat Sameera,18 May 2017,4,"It's affordable, accessible and there's quick service. I had been to other outlets (Chandanagar, Kukatpally and A.S.Rao Nagar) and the experience in each was satisfactory. My friends dragged me to this place when it was raining heavily. It was one kind of adventure.

I had Vegetable Burger. My friends had Vegetable Samosa and Chicken Roll. After eating a burger, I did not have anything for dinner. It was good enough for me. Go for it, if you want to have bakery stuff at lower prices. Great VFM!"
PourHouse7,Suman Ghosh,25 May 2019,3,"Pocket-friendly place for a quick round of drinks. Tried their LIIT & Tequila Sunrise, along with a bunch of Chicken, Fish & veg starters. In the drinks, the Tequila Sunrise stood out with a distinct flavor, while LIIT was just the standard one. Would recommend to try the Chicken Nazakath - it lived up to its name with juicy and succulent pieces :-)

The place has 2+2 on Zomato Gold, and offers happy hours every day till evening. So saves the pocket-pinch."
PourHouse7,Sudipta Routray,22 May 2019,5,Visited the clubbing section of the resturant must say ambience is too Good. Visited for ladies and bollywood night and one of the most nice DJs i could say.. Coming to drinks and they lived upto expectations.. we order Chinken Nazakat and butter garlic prawns and they were exotic and tasty...Finding these two too good went ahead with Fish Finger and kalmi Kabab.. They were good too...to scale up i would say must visit it to enjoy it.
PourHouse7,Prachi Pant,21 May 2019,4,"Went for a friend‚Äôs birthday celebration. The dj ans the sound system was decent. One thing that I noticed, when we moved from the indoors to the rooftop, the staff was very quick to transfer our table. The veg white sauce pasta was pretty good, though the biryani could be improved a little. Overall a good experience. And kudos to the bar service! Very polite staff. :)"
PourHouse7,Venkat.Ch,21 May 2019,4,"Good place to come with it pals.. As i been visited this place more that couple for time.. I think the place is good and how ever i only visited post lunches looking forqard to dropin in the evening..

PourHouse7,Rohit Kumar,19 May 2019,5,Ambience was great.. food was good too.. service was pretty fast.. drinks were as I expected.. Pradhan was my appointed guy and he was very respectful and fast in delivering my orders..
PourHouse7,Ankit Saraf,18 May 2019,2,"Loud music, average food and untrained staff sums up the place.
We ordered a veg hakka noodle which was pathetic and one special pizza which was very average.
While ordering the pizza, the staff didn't know the toppings on the pizza.
Above all the DJ was playing all wierd songs and was very loud"
PourHouse7,Samujjwal Baruah,17 May 2019,2,"Overrated! Average food. Limited menu! Served Cocktails with alcohol content as that of Mocktails!
Service is also average. Not served until called upon, 10-15mins after arrival.
Do not expect a great experience!"
PourHouse7,Anurupa Mondal,17 May 2019,2,Not a place I would visit again. Menu is very limited and cocktails got no alcohol at all. Visited on a Friday night and totally disappointed. Crowd also not good . Never visit would be my advice... Hyderabad got tons of better options.
PourHouse7,Venu Gopal,10 May 2019,5,A place to hangout with your friends and colleagues... Match lovers can enjoy here. They put the live screening of the match in the rooftop.

Thanks for serving us in such a polite way... Thanks alot

PourHouse7,Dinesh Jana,10 May 2019,5,Pour house 7 is an awesome rooftop bar im gachibowli. We went on a Friday for the ladies night and it was jam packed. The DJ was awesome and so was the crowd. Keep up the good work guys. And for ladies they do ladies night every Wednesday Friday and Sunday so thats a plus.
PourHouse7,Anjali Gupta,10 May 2019,1,We went for a quick drinks+snacks catchup. They have zomato gold on drinks but they showed a lot of restraint to provide that. We found the food quality average and service even below average. Avoidable all all costs.
PourHouse7,Ashish Bisht,05 May 2019,1,Horrible experience.Food was really bad and service was very slow. Most of dishes mentioned/recommended in other reviews were not even part of their menu. First time i had such a disappointment with any 4+ rated restaurant.
PourHouse7,Abhishek Dey,04 May 2019,5,"Rooftop is a great place to hang out with friends.

PourHouse7,Chandra Sekhar Reddy,01 May 2019,2,Place and music was good. Food was tasteless. Not upto quality. service was better but I have noticed crew was busy moving/jumbling the seats all over floor all the time.? Not a very pleasant experience for a first time visitor.
PourHouse7,Vishnu S,01 May 2019,4,"We enjoy drinks and full of starters in veg and non veg. Rooftop ambience really good. Chicken 65, chicken pakoda, crispy corn was very good."
PourHouse7,Kanthi Sri,29 April 2019,4,Good food ... barbeque chicken was litüî•...it was so spicy ..though I liked it very much ..I also ordered chicken popcorn which I felt was tasteless .however the place and the service was good ..

PourHouse7,Pranav Goel,27 April 2019,1,"Its almost like they do not want to get you your food. Waited 1.5 hours for the food and all we got was 'Its on the way'. Ordered the BBQ Veg Pizza. Just baked corn and onions on bread. Small portion sizes makes it not worth it. Ordered the Veg Lasagna, but had to cancel it at the end due to 'Its coming' reason."
PourHouse7,Sayan Pattnaik,27 April 2019,4,"Awesome place... The waiters have good behaviour and the DJ is awesome.
The food here is also good. We had ordered Chicken kebab which was properly cooked and yet soft."
PourHouse7,Tahishi Gupta,20 April 2019,3,"We ordered strawberry delight , virgin mojito, crispy corn and chicken 65. Crispy corn was too salty and the chicken 65 was not cooked properly."
PourHouse7,Amruta Karve,18 April 2019,3,"Very niceee place. Loved it üòç
Its big place spread across 3floors. Ambience is too good. Each floor has different ambiance. We choose to sit rooftop. DJ was keeping the atmosphere good.. But can be more good!
We had chicken n fish starters n drinks. Fish was not so good (had some odd smell), when we informed them, our dish was replaced with chickentikka which was tasty!!
Overall nice place to hangout."
PourHouse7,Sam Brett,17 April 2019,5,"Perfectly a best place to hangout..... Starters were awesome and delicious, dj played with hip hop and remix was a kinda mood changing..... Over all good experience will visit again üëç"
PourHouse7,Swastika Swayn,16 April 2019,5,Amazingly untouched place. Sunset is a view! Good ambience. And delicious veg nuggets. Worth the time and money. Service by Pradhan was great. Music was also good. Spacious seating.
PourHouse7,Prachita Jayaswal,14 April 2019,5,"Perfect hangout place!!
The setting is basic and ambience is great. The service is superb. Quality and quantity of the food, both are awesome. The corn kebab is good. They have a terrace sitting. The music is amazing!"
PourHouse7,Hardik Astik,14 April 2019,3,"Food is not up to the mark in comparision to other pubs. Veg Manchurian was sweeter than required. Chicken Tikka were not soft and taste was not up to the mark. Sweet Tomato sauce was put on Nachos.
Drinks were quite cheaper then other pubs."
PourHouse7,Jharna Karira,12 April 2019,4,"The place is not really roof top, if you've to chill with someone, like talk I would recommend.
Was with a friend where we had a good conversation.
Had a couple of beers, thanks to gold membership :p
Ordered roasted chilli prawns which was good
Had chicken lasagna pasta which was very heavy, we couldn't finish it, it tasted good as well.
Over all, a budget free and a nice place.
Because of summer, you might feel hot in there after a couple of drinks, but a good place, might visit again."
PourHouse7,Rohan - Total Foodie,11 April 2019,5,"Usually don't get a chance to go out for lunch on weekdays, but finally got a chance with colleagues to do so after a client meeting. Since the meeting was in Gachibowli, we decided to try out a place not too far from IKEA.
So we landed at PourHouse7 which is located above the maruti showroom.
For appetizers we started by ordering Kung Pao chicken, spicy black pin chicken, stir fried vegetables and also order a veg spring salad. Both the chicken appetizers were excellent, the Kung Pao chicken was hot and spicy and the spicy black pin was a little sweet and sour and full of flavor. The stir fried vegetables was made of a plethora of vegetables which included mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, baby corn and carrots.
Along with appetizers we ordered mocktails, blue sea, virgin mojito, pinacolada and PH7's special in house mocktail. Among the mocktails the one which stood out was the special in house drink.
Coming to main course, we ordered paneer butter masala, butter chicken and rotis. The butter chicken was delicious, chicken was tender, buttery and cooked perfectly. Paneer was soft and fresh.
The best dish of our lunch was the 7H special biryani. Wrapped in an omelette, the biryani was visually appealing. The rice was flavorful, chicken full of spices and this biryani was amazing.
Overall we had a fantastic time. If anyone is around gachibowli and looking for a drink and good food, this is the place to visit."
PourHouse7,Sneha Panda,11 April 2019,5,"Pour House 7 is very easy to locate as it is around half a kilometre away from IKEA. It is on the fourth floor if the building.

AMBIENCE -
It gives you best of both worlds. It has rooftop seatings and an air conditioned seating. The ambience is very sassy. It is surely a party place.

FOOD -

‚Ä¢MOCKTAILS-
I tried flavoured Mojito, Virgin Mojito, PH7 special Mojito, Pina Colada and Sweet Sunrise. All the mocktails were flavourful, beautiful and refreshing. My personal favourite was Sweet Sunrise.

‚Ä¢STARTERS AND SALAD
I tried Kung Pao Chicken, Crispy Corn, Stir Fried Vegetables, Veg Spring Salad and Spicy Black Pin.

Kung Pao Chicken: The chicken was well cooked and most importantly, it wasn't bland. The spices were just right for a person like me who prefers spicy food. The dish also included honey so it tasted slightly sweet which took the dish on another level. üÜô Definitely a must try!

Spicy Black Pin: It was kinda similar to Kung pao chicken but was grilled and wasn't sweet. It tasted nice.

Crispy Corn: It was sweet and crispy. Presentation was on point. üëå

Stir Fried Vegetables: The vegetables were cooked properly and the spices were complimenting the vegetables.

Veg Spring Salad: It was very tasty and healthy. The coating of the salad was bringing the best taste of the veggies.

‚Ä¢MAIN COURSE-
I tried Chicken Alfredo Pasta, Sicilian Pizza, Paneer Tikka Masala, Naan, Butter Chicken and 7H Biryani.

Chicken Alfredo Pasta: It was creamy and absolutely delicious. The chicken was very well cooked. Loved it!

Sicilian Pizza: It was loaded with veggies and the amount of cheese was okay. I'm not a "" too much Cheese"" person so it tasted good. Also, you can ask the staff to put more cheese.

Paneer tikka masala: It was spicy and flavourful. The paneer was soft and tender. Very well made üëå

PourHouse7,Sanober Khanam,11 April 2019,5,"So this place is located near ikea above the maruti showroom, gachibowli Been to pour house 7 two days ago& was really good it's an excellent place for party lovers & foodies I had the best time the ambience where it has both indoor and roof top seating and loved the rooftop seating started off with it's delicious mocktails like mojito,pina colada,sunrise
My personal favorite was definitely Pina colada! And how can I not mention their mouth water biryani and Kung Pao chicken the kung Pao chicken it's so flavor full at first you'll taste the garlic & then a hit of sweetness Because of it's honey I definitely recommend it to people
I've watched one of the best sunsets of my life from their rooftop I'm a sucker for good food - good view loved every bit of that place
Its a must visit when you're in Hyderabad!

Ambience-5/5
Food& drinks 5/5
Service and staff5/5.!!"
PourHouse7,Ipsit Sahoo,11 April 2019,4,Good place. Didn't really like the dj music but it is better than a few other places in and around gachibowli. Ladies night a big plus to check out. Food was good. Open area so the environment isn't that great during summers
PourHouse7,Infracom IIMK,11 April 2019,5,It's good place to visit. Pradhan was serving us. He was polite and friendly. Had a good time. Like to visit again at night for checking out.
PourHouse7,Hardik Nahata,10 April 2019,5,"Here is my Review!

LOCATION:-
Very easy to locate, it is very near to IKEA, a prominent landmark in Hyderabad. Its on the 4th floor, also rooftop option is available in the evening time. 

AMBIENCE :-

Once you enter the Pub, the interior will blow you away. The unique point about PH7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of Gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.

FOOD :-
I tried lot many things here ! Here is the detailed review of every item:

MOCKTAILS:
-
PH7 SPECIAL MOCKTAIL- It literally holds the name! The most colorful mojito I ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!

BLUE SEA- Its so beautiful to look at! The blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.

PINA COLADA- You might wanna skip this one, I found the flavors not complementing each other.

FLAVORED VIRGIN MOJITO - Most recommended drink for hot summers. Refreshing, minty and relaxing !

SALADS:-
STIR FRIED VEGETABLES- The main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. They could go a bit less on the oil though.

VEG SPRING SALAD- It gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!

MAIN:-

BUTTER PANEER & ROTI- I prefer Paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! Its pretty heavy, I was almost done with 2 Rotis.

SICILIAN PIZZA - The pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. You can mention to add more cheese to make it better. It was okay overall.

CRISPY CORN - The presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. The taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. Could be my own preference. You can still try it out.

OVERALL:-
Pour House 7 is the go-to spot if you're around Gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! I would surely recommend this place. Do try out in the night-time and enjoy the rooftop :)"
PourHouse7,Raja Gopal Reddy Chereddy,09 April 2019,5,"Crazy place guys....very small and middle of non residential area and top of a residential place.
DJ with IPL...it was crazy, I was there with my boss, he loved it but it's bit crowded.
Limited IMFLs and staff was good and humble."
PourHouse7,Fsv.hcg123,09 April 2019,5,"The food was good and the ambience was good too.
Pradhan helped us in getting the food sorted and was always helpful.
The starters and main course was better than what we expected and the servers were helpful."
PourHouse7,Nikhil Agarwal,07 April 2019,1,"We went with a lot of hopes, but were disappointed by the food. Staff members are quite good, but if their food doesn't match the standards, why would someone go there.
We ordered Paneer tikka n Shan Ghai rolls, both were not tasty."
PourHouse7,Shaik Ilyas,05 April 2019,5,"spacious roof top n very friendly staff, nice offers for cooperate ppl...best place to njy d evening....food was very yummy....i love the environment Ty guys.....for lovely evening"
PourHouse7,Kshitij Mishra,05 April 2019,5,"Went to this place, service was excellent, Titu helped us like anything, really polite and understanding, food was amazing and so was the ambience. Worth visiting really awesome."
PourHouse7,Dhanusha.1315,05 April 2019,1,"BAD food! BAD service too! We ordered pizza, Veg manchuria and crispy corn. We did not like either of those. Never gonna go there ever again."
PourHouse7,Pranjali Adhav,03 April 2019,5,One of the peaceful places to hangout with friends... Open terrace and the staff is amazing... Food is good too... Hope you come and visit this place.
PourHouse7,Surya.nandu.SN,03 April 2019,2,A decent place for party and a cozy climate too. Veg manchurian was great and chicken kebabs were fine. First thing that disappoints me is there is no drought beer and the most annoying thing was the behaviour of the manager ‚ÄòAKTHAR‚Äô. There has to be some respect towards the guests and the managers was bossing everyone around. I‚Äôm giving this a two star only coz of him else I would have given a 4 maybe if I had the drought beers.
PourHouse7,"Sairam, Special Seniorita",02 April 2019,4,"Nice food and drinks, maybe they can add some more to the menu. It was ladies night the day i went, enjoyed, very friendly crowd... Suddenly we all made a big group and danced our hearts out. Cheerful comfy place... Would go there again."
PourHouse7,Nom.Nom.Foodie (Ruthwikkumar Durgam),31 March 2019,4,"Been to this place recently along with few of my friends for lunch and we had a good experience. The food was delicious ( Only reason to give 4 star rating ) but the Staff were so neglected to us ( at our time of visit ).
The whole review will be updated soon :)"
PourHouse7,Srinivas Pamarthi,31 March 2019,3,"Place is not so appealing as we went in afternoon and no one was there at this place

There was dust all over the place as some construction work is going on

Food is ok

Ambience poor

Reachability ok

Overall experience 2.5/5"
PourHouse7,Food Lover,31 March 2019,1,"Don't have zero rate here, one I m giving bcoz they welcomed me nice way, but food was sucks here, we had three starters which were not good at all, chicken starter was smelling may be they use stock or stale chic. Not come again here, very bad experience. Total wasting of money .

PourHouse7,Juhi Nayak,29 March 2019,3,"Super ambience at rooftop!! üëåüèª

PourHouse7,Suhas Reddy,28 March 2019,3,"Been here on a Thursday afternoon, the place is very different from the pics, indoor seating is congested and uncomfortable, starters in the happy hours can be improved, service is good"
PourHouse7,Meghana,25 March 2019,4,Ambiance was superb of ph7 specially the roof top...dj was good and the drinks and food were up to the mark....subhash was the guy who served us very well...If you are thinking of a good ambiance place with good food and drinks then should visit this place for sure...we are gonna come back very soon

PourHouse7,Sawan Suman,25 March 2019,3,"We visited this place today. A decent rooftop place with good ambience, ipl screening, okayish food and dj. The service is a tad bit slow, giving a resemblance of a place not visited often. Though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season, the place bore a deserted look!
Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd.
We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn. Both of them turned out to be very oily. We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish. Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change. They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne.
If you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket, can opt for PourHouse7."
PourHouse7,Madhus Kitchen,25 March 2019,5,I visited this place on Friday with my friends..The roof top view was awesome and loved the food and drinks too....the staffs were very polite...Will visit again very soon
PourHouse7,Shomik Sen,24 March 2019,2,"Average ambience , average food and average experience. Not worth the 500 bucks they charged for entry as cover which was not even adjusted with the bill. Music was too loud making it difficult to sit through. A number of items on the menu were unavailable though service was prompt. Had high hopes because of the Zomato rating but was thoroughly disappointed. Should give it a miss if one is looking for a classier experience."
PourHouse7,RM,23 March 2019,1,"One star only because zero star is not an option.
Probably one of the worst and slow place in Hyderabad.
Only one bartender/waiter who was not even in the bar for most of the time."
PourHouse7,Rajeev,19 March 2019,1,"Walked in during happy hour and was shocked to know they had very few drinks available, and out of beers. And when asked, the service staff had no clue. All they said was ""no stock, it may take an hour or more."" Sad!"

PourHouse7 is a spacious rooftop bar that offers amazing ambiance, like a bird-eye point of view, with live music and screening. They have comfortable seating arrangement according to our convenience. And the service was prompt and the staff was polite & friendly.

Coming to Mocktails:
We tried Virgin Mojito, Virgin Colada and Sweet Sunrise. The Virgin Mojito and Sweet sunrise were really refreshing and the Virgin Colada was okay.

Appetizers:
Murgh lasooni Kali mirch tikka:
Tandoori Chicken with black pepper, cardamom & garam masala. Chicken skewers soaked in marinade, cooked in a tandoor with spices, giving it the rustic feels which were super delicious. Highly recommend.

Crispy chilli fish:
The flavour and the texture of this crispy chilli fish was really amazing.

Classic chicken spring rolls:
The rolls filled with chicken and full of veggies were deeply fried. The taste was amazing and the crispness was on point. And served with a sweet & spicy sauce dip. Must try out.

Great Nawabi pizza:
The pizza was loaded with cheese, chicken and veggies. And the taste was great but the presentation could have been better.

Tangadi kabab:
Chicken drumsticks marinated in aromatic Indian spices and grilled to perfection which were really amazing in terms of taste.

Onion rings:
These easy onion rings are double dipped in a batter that is seasoned to perfection. The crust was crisp and the onions were tender and sweet served with hot & spicy sauce.

Main course
7H biryani:
The biryani was enclose in egg omelette, the chicken was tender and the basmati rice was fluffy which was amazing in taste.

Pesto-rice with chicken stroganoff:
Pesto green rice is flavoured with jarred pesto and topped with fresh herbs and chicken stroganoff made with chicken breast smothered in a sour cream stroganoff sauce which was really delicious.

Dessert:
We tried Brownie with vanilla ice-cream topped with Hershey‚Äôs syrup which was a treat to our taste buds.

Overall my experience @PourHouse7 was really amazing. Thanks to the staff for offering great hospitality."
PourHouse7,Kaushani Roy Choudhury,15 March 2019,3,"I chose this place because a friend of mine recommended and I was pretty disappointed with the sluggish service as it was not even standard.
There was just one bartender on a Friday night, which really escalated the waiting time. Service on the food section was even slower. As the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm. I was extremely displeased.
If you want visit pourhouse7 then I would suggest going only for dancing and that too only if you can tolerate the high base."
PourHouse7,Abhimanyu Iyer,13 March 2019,2,"Place looked good when entering but that was it, it went downhill from there. It took three people from their staff one after the other to confirm what we had ordered and it was only one dish. We had to wait for 25-30 minutes for the order only to realise they had served it to somebody else. This was when there were only 5 tables occupied. The staff seemed inexperienced.
The toilet's location is just bad. Whenever somebody opens the toilet door the whole place stinks up like piss.
We just gave up on the place and left paying for the drinks that they had managed to serve.
The owners and managers really need to look into the problems."
PourHouse7,HyderabadFoodbloggers,12 March 2019,5,"Pourhouse7 is a spacious roof top bar that offers great ambience, Paranomic views of the cityscape and prompt friendly service.
Everything is in our budget.

Pesto rice with chicken stroganoff .
The rice was soft it was good in taste especially the chicken stroganoff was best and it tasted good with the rice.

This was our lunch menu for 4 people.

Apart from that everything was good here...

Best place for partying on weekends with friends
you'll enjoy it with a good music and dj's play list.
Only on weekends you'll find dj's playing songs and music over there.

Overall it is a good place to visit...."
PourHouse7,Bryan Rodrigues,05 March 2019,4,"Hopped into this place around 9 PMish on Saturday!

Roof-Top, Pleasant atmosphere and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù crowd.

Preferred drinking a full bottle than sipping on shots along side ordered for Corn kernels, Chic Lollipop, Malai Broccoli as accompaniment to the alcohol and all were indeed severed on time, tasted good too.

This place is a newbie in town (or maybe I am wrong) However, I got to meet an Old Pal who was playing on sets as the guest Dj for that night there.

Music played was Electronic & Bollywood.

Shall return sometime again!"

We called and asked for a dance floor, but after we entered there was no designated dance floor and mostly stags dancing. Our girls were uncomfortable and didn't enjoy much. Maybe a couple's section in dance floor will be good. Food was good and service is decent."

Pour house 7 being one of the latest pub here is a good one to spend a weekend evening,with its beautiful roof top ambience which is very attractive.
I‚Äôve been to this place in the evening with a group of friends and It was really good experience.
We ordered the mocktails ,there were different varieties and we ordered the sweet sunrise ,lichitini,chatpaata ,virgin mojito,Bombay Kolini and kesari blue.
The sweet sunrise was the best among all.They were served in very attractive way.
As huge chocolate lover ,I‚Äôve ordered the chocotini,a cold brew which tasted great.
Then we started ordering starters,the haryali paneer tikka which was well cooked and a crispy as it has to be.
Then we ordered nazaakat kebab(chicken starter),wakto cylindo chicken.
These tasted good and would love to go back to have these.
Butte de kwaab a corn item which looks like hari bari kebab was also good .
The sea food starter,butter garlic fish which was also well cooked and served.
The classic onion rings (called burj kalifa because of its presentation) which was the best among all the starters.
It was served with tamato sauce which was a great combination.
The main course had biryani,which was wrapped in egg omelette and it tasted amazing.
Finally ended the meal with brownie with ice cream which tasted not that great but was okay.

PourHouse7,Harshitha. K,26 February 2019,4,"Pour House 7 is located just above Maruthi showroom, that's pretty close to Ikea at Gachibowli.
Ambience- So, the place is really spacious with both indoor seating( club ) and a rooftop bar! Their indoor section has a simple bar set up with vibrant paintings on the wall at the entrance, cozy leather sofas in black and dim lighting. Their rooftop area is well done with brick walls, high chairs/ tables and trees planted in pots. They've a DJ set up and a big screen as well! So guys, how about beating the heat with their cocktails while enjoying the fabulous view of the city from the rooftop?

Food- I was here with my friends the other day for lunch and we tried the following,
APPETIZERS
* Tandoori malai broccoli- Broccoli are marinated in cheese & cashew paste and cooked in a tandoor! It was scrumptious. ( 4/5 )

* Crispy chapa- Fish fillets are marinated in Indian masala and deep fried to perfection! It was topped with fried curry leaves and chillies. Must try! ( 5/5 )

* Chicken nachos- Tortilla chips topped with pieces of chicken, red beans, corn and other veggies were delish you guys! Another favourite. ( 4/5 )

* Fish fingers- Fish fillets cut into strips are coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. They were so crispy from the outside and tender from the inside. It came along with french fries and mayonnaise. ( 5/5 )

* Moroccan chicken sticks- Grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and other spices! They were smoky and appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* Jhinga nasheela- Prawns marinated in Indian masala and grilled! It was crispy and medium spiced. ( 3/5 )

* Bruschetta- Slices of sandwich bread are topped with veggies & cheese and baked! They were seasoned with red chilli flakes. Honestly, It wasn't even bruschetta in the first place! Give it a miss. ( 2/5 )

MAIN COURSE-
* 7H special chicken biryani- Basmati rice cooked along with pieces of chicken marinated in Indian masala! The entire dish was covered with an omelette that was topped with fried onions. It was truly unique in terms of both taste and presentation. Highly recommend the biryani! ( 5/5 )

* Spaghetti aglio e olio( veg )- Spaghetti tossed in olive oil along with black olives, garlic and chilli flakes! It was appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* Great nawabi pizza- Pizza topped with chicken tikka, veggies and mayo! Although the toppings were generous and spicy, the base of the pizza was a serious let down! It was hard. ( 3/5 )

* Alishaan chicken s/w- Pieces of chicken, lettuce and other veggies along with mayo are sandwiched between two grilled breads! Served along with fries and salad. It was just okay-ish. ( 3/5 )

DRINKS
So we tried a few mocktails( about 5 ) and honestly they were bad! The only saviour was Virgin Mojito.

The staff are polite and friendly!
VFM- 4/5; Service- 4/5"
PourHouse7,Rameez Siddiqui,26 February 2019,5,"Went to this place a couple of weeks back owing to the buzz in the city about this place.
We started off with Haryali paneer tikka whixh was extremely tender and juicy
The other vegetarian delicacies we had were Chilly paneer and Bhutte de kebab . Loved the kebab unexpectedly. Recommending that kebab.
Butter Garlic fish was something differently exquisite. It was topped with gravy and when you eat a piece it was crunchy. Its very tough to do that,Kudos to the chef.
Nazakhat kebab and Mutton mazedaar were kind of favourites because of their awesome taste.
For maincourse we had the 7 H Biryani. It was delicious biryani full of chicken and masala covered totally by an omelet topping.
The crispy onion rings and its special sauce were the showstoppers of the day. Totally loved it.
For desserts we had the caramelized brownie with ice cream.
Highly recommend this place to everybody."
PourHouse7,Meraj Ahmed,24 February 2019,4,"One of the beautiful rooftop party places in Gachibowli and in the vicinity of Hi-tech City.

Been here last weekend and tasted some of the Sig ature delicacies.

Roof-top had a beautiful ambiance and a beautiful skyline view of High Rise buildings in the surrounding.

Started off with Some exotic colourful mocktails. Mocktails tasted good but they lacked that Fizz! Informed the same to the manager who was polite to take it as a feedback. Chocotina shake was superbbbb!

Starters which I really liked were, 7 house Crispy Fish, Chicken Majestic and Paneer ke Sholay.

Fish was juicy and crispy on the outside, and tasted so good with the spices that were coated.

There was this Burj Khalifa Onion Rings appetizer, which was innovative and was best with the sauce that it came with.

They have Special Biryani in their maincourse which was worth Having.

Great Nawabi Pizza was with trying. Also,NonVeg Pasta in White sauce.

Choco Brownie with Vanilla ice Cream and Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Icecream were in the desserts.

Overall it was a good experience. Place offers corporate lunch and dinner packages. Good option for people who are looking for corporate parties lunch and dinner."
PourHouse7,Karna Nair,22 February 2019,5,"Today I visited this place called Pour House 7 in Gachibowli.The place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.The rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.The indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.Coming to the food it was really mind blowing.We tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.Lets have a look at the items we tried starting from Mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
Firstly we had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which literally surprised me.Who had thought Broccoli could be that tasty....It tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.Next we had Crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.This was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.Morrocan Chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.The chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.The chicken was nice tender and juicy too.I love seafood and so I ended up ordering a Jhinga Nasheela...This tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.It was just good that's it.We also had Chicken Nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.Loved it.We also had a Bruschetta which was average.Along with these we also ordered Aalishaan Chicken sandwich which I would say was not at all aalishaan.This was not good.It lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.Next we had a Nawabi Chicken pizza and it was really good.The topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.The pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but I still had it because of the amazing topping.We had a platter of Fish Fingers and fries and it was excellent.Both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
After devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the Special 7H Biriyani and Spaghetti Aglio-e-olio.I am in love with their biriyani.It was not like any other biriyani that I have ever tasted before.It was unique and it was excellent too.It has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in Hyderabad and I could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.The spaghetti I would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
Now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and Gulab Jamuns.I would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.The Jamuna were decent.
We also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.They need to improve their moctails.The only one I felt was perfect was the Virgin Mojito.Other Mocktails we had were not good.We had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.But we did not like these much.

Overall I would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.The drinks need immense improvement.Thats it folks.This was my review of the place.Hope you like it."
PourHouse7,Sunny Mehta,21 February 2019,1,"Such a pathetic service, no one will attend you, you have to ask them.nice place but service will annoy you.Have to think before coming.first time bad experience"
PourHouse7,Poojitha Reddy,21 February 2019,1,"March 15th : Had to change my rating to 1 today, the worst service ever. My table is right across the bar and no one cared to take an order till half an hour. The staff doesn't know a thing about service. Tables are unclean and stick! As usual the stupid DJ is Soo loud but it got better later. Poor maintainince of the place adds to everything. I literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order. Waiter is so absent minded. Imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins.
The poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people. Some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place. There was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing. It was a really pathetic experience and I would definitely choose a different place next time.

Special mention to Dharmender, who was very attentive.
I haven't tasted much of their menu, but the white sauce penne pasta was average, I expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt. The chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks. The only thing I liked about the place was that it stocked Kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places. The seating could be arranged better, seats weren't that comfortable and I keep hurting my knees Everytime I make a move. The music/DJ was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all ! If you can please get the DJ to reduce the volume at least during peak dinner hours, I couldn't hear anything my colleagues sitting across the table were speaking!"
PourHouse7,Ayushasc123,17 February 2019,3,The greek pizza was totally not worth rest was very good.Taste of cheese fries and mushroom was best.prices were too high which was not worth in many other dishes as well.
PourHouse7,Puneet Gupta,17 February 2019,3,Good rooftop location however ambience not set properly.. average service uninterested service managers.. disappointing that it is going down with time. Limited product availability.. mostly you don't get the product that you want to order and they give very limited choice.
PourHouse7,Akshith,16 February 2019,5,I visited this place along with my friends today the food at this place was really good the ambience was good the service was fine I will update a detailed review of this place as soon as possible
PourHouse7,Dhruv Chhabra,16 February 2019,4,"A good place to be when you are short on budget. Good food, nice ambience. Try to visit with a group of friends to have more fun since the area is not that big to have a table for 2 more."

PourHouse7,Ambika Remyaa Paramesh Nair,11 February 2019,5,"The Sunday Ladies Night is so much fun here. With a rooftop dining experience, this place is specially great for that new moon night. Great food and ambience. Though the restrooms need some hygiene check, it definitely is a great place to chill out!"

PourHouse7,Avishek Chakraborty,09 February 2019,3,"If you want to visit a place which will have a rooftop setup. Then it is one of the places you can give a visit. The food is okay and even the price of booze is quite affordable. With Zomato gold it would be a great place to visit.
Cheers"
PourHouse7,Satadru Biswas,09 February 2019,2,"Rated 4.1 on zomato. quite disappointed. Friday night perhaps got the service lil delayed. Music too loud, too many smokers and the pizza had huge cubes of onions. :("
PourHouse7,My Food Madness (Pranitha),07 February 2019,4,"A place to hangout with friends. This place is good for night life. They have the best view from the roof top area.
We visited this place for dinner. The weather was freezing cold, i was craving some hot soup.
We ordered chicken manchow soup and lemon coriander soup. The soups were perfect for a freezing cold evening.
Comming to the mocktails the virgin colada, chatpata madness and sex on the beach were very soothing.
Starters were delicious we had
Hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful.
Lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth.
Tandoori broccoli was my favourite from this place.
Main course was really gud.
Finishing with the desserts the hot chocolate brownie with ice cream was too tempting and sweet.
Overall a great experience. Surely must visit this place for ambience and their starters. Loved this place and the view."
PourHouse7,Eat Like Jo üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥,07 February 2019,4,"At Gachibowli we have a new rooftop dining place which captures the astonishing view of Hyderabad‚Äôs new side overlooking the mighty IKEA. We dined at Pourhouse7 where they house a club too at the floor below the rooftop.
.
It was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on. But on a regular evening, the place would be warm. They have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala.
.
The starters were not that great and needs much improvement. They had chicken manchow soup, and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won‚Äôt be expecting much orders on them as it‚Äôs a bar. The Hyderabadi Tawa Fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night. In the vegetarian department I‚Äôll recommend Tandoori Broccoli ü•¶.
.
Further to the main course the Tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs. The masalas of Cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty. They were an amazing combination with the rotis. The place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of.
.
Food-3/5
Ambience -4.5/5
Service-3/5
Value for money-3/5"
PourHouse7,Charushila Biswas,05 February 2019,3,"Went to Pour House 7 in Gachibowli recently. The rooftop seating is very airy. We ordered:

‚ñ™Virgin Mojito - tasted ok.
‚ñ™Orange chat pat - Tasted yummy!
‚ñ™Chicken Manchow soup - tasted ok
‚ñ™Hyderabadi Tawa Fish - this one was a crowd pleaser but unfortunately couldn't please me :(
‚ñ™Lahsuni Paneer Tikka - paneer tikka was good, flavors were well balanced.
‚ñ™Tangdi Kebab - it was ok
‚ñ™Tandoori Brocolli - this one was impressive. I liked the lemon marmalade that they served with it.
For main course we orderd:
‚ñ™Butter Naan - it was way too thin and oily.
‚ñ™Murg Cashew Nut - Tasted good.
For dessert we had:
‚ñ™ Brownie - the sides were too crispy. Could have tasted better.

Overall, I think there's room for a lot of improvement in their food and ambience. The music can also be better. Hope they will take it as constructive feedback and work at it :)"
PourHouse7,Sai Krishna,05 February 2019,5,Decent food and good service.our waiter subash was very nice and friendly.his presence just improved the ambience of the place.time well spent.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Samsonjohn1417,22 May 2019,5,"Nice ambience with light systems and music in an international level
We partied very hard with amazing cocktails
The bartenders were preparing cocktails & shots like india ever had
Its not only a club it is an other party world"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Prachi Pant,21 May 2019,5,"Went to attend the Nucleya concert (May 2019). It was very very crowded. But the ambience is great. The interior design is definitely one of its kind. Good place to party with friends. The security is nice. Since it was a crowded evening, the only thing we ordered was a pizza, which was Okayish."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sneh Tarang Randev,19 May 2019,5,"This place is lit! I totally enjoyed everything from service to set up to light, sound and the magical paper bursting thing they do towards the end. Given the current trend of clubs in Hyd, I don't find the place expensive. The waiters and bouncers were friendly, even on a busy night with Zaedan performing and took great care."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Ashok Reddy,18 May 2019,5,"Well well well!
This is the most happening place in the Hyderabad right now!!
Ambience as too good, a great place to dance!
I was there at this place for MC Sher (Siddharth Chaturvedi) event! I really witnessed craziest crowd in Hyd!! The event was really spectacular!
Would love to go to this place again!
Full pashaa log because it‚Äôs posh place üòâ!
Only minus here is price!!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Jesal Vora,16 May 2019,4,I had visited this place for the nucleya event. It was super crowded. V didn't even have place to stand. Since it was very crowded the service was delayed too. Overall the place is nice.. just the crowd was an issue.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Venkat Murthy,15 May 2019,5,"Well to start of with I was there for Nucleya event. The place is just awesome and in Hyderabad at first it was hard to find a proper club. And then prism happened. Great team who managed more than 3k people that night.

Ambience - 5/5.
Food - 4/5.
Service- 4/5.
Menu - 4/5.

A must visit place if you want to really enjoy clubbing."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Amit Vij,12 May 2019,5,"Loved the place and loved the music. Amazing DJs great food and drinks. Not very expensive. Ambience is worth experiencing the sound, lights and the special effects was one of the best I have experienced. I have partied in many places in Mumbai however this place took it to the next level"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Shahrukh Hasan,11 May 2019,1,"The reception was quite disappointing. We came at around 7, we were asked to come in an hour confirming that stag entry was allowed for a certain fee.

Later at 9 we were just denied entry becaue apptetnyl everybody at the reception had quite an attitude and trip of their own.

The most disappointing experiences in Hyd."
Prism Club & Kitchen,BHUPINDERPAL SINGH JUDGE,11 May 2019,1,"Believe me, pls dont go to this pathetic place in hyd. I have been in many pubs in hyd but this is beyond worst. They don't know how to manage a huge crowd plus don't provide good service , plus there is network issues so you cannot pay through your card and they will force you to pay cash"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Harshet Agarwal,04 May 2019,3,"This place a great feel to it 
very vibrant and loud
good to have a pool party at this time of the year
amazing place to party
hoping to visit soon"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Arythmatik,27 April 2019,1,"Great place. The setup is truly one of its kind. But the Staff and the ""entitled"" crowd will spoil the experience completely for you. Absolutely pathetic hospitality, they lack even the basic human courtesy. Lusty uncles and snobby bouncers is all they have in their crew."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Mayank Jaggi,26 April 2019,5,"Fabulous place. Really enjoyed my time here. Good food, good cocktails. Trippy lights make for am amazing ambience. Peppy music. The only cons are that it is a bit pricey and the DJ doesn't play hindi songs. Don't judge me please! :P Loved it. Must visit."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Inderjeet Singh,25 April 2019,5,Amazing club. Great lighting and house DJ is fantastic. Great food. Special mention to Parida our server for the excellent service. Must visit place for all party animals.

Huge dance floor to let go n dance your heart out:)
Amazing lighting and the vibes at this place is just mind-blowing üòé
#not a place for socializing#arena for partying hardü§ò"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Divya Reddy,21 April 2019,5,"This place was just out of this world, they use the entire digital capacity of the place to blow your mind. The in house DJ is just unbelievable, the beats will get you bouncing on your feet. We had gone for Ritviz's show which was a super duper hit. They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well). The ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Manthena Sandeep,16 April 2019,5,"Fantastic place for an event!!!awesome service...special shout to Vijay @prism for taking good care of us..?!! definitely goin back!
Great Vibes!!"

Prism Club & Kitchen,Nikhil Lakhotia,12 April 2019,1,"Too much attitude display by all staff. Need to be taught manners regarding how to be courteous to guests. Only Ambience, food just about ok."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Bhavya Tyagi,11 April 2019,1,"After hearing a lot about this place I got a chance to finally visit this. As once reaction was ""Wow"" but that went away pretty soon.
Right from the Entry there was a confusion. We did a booking through Dine Out for 8:30 pm which didn't really make sense as the table were not blocked. To figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come. When asked about the reservation, Manager was totally Rude and said to my wife that ""She should be happy that she got a table"". I mean WOW, it was an eye opener for us.
And at that point I realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places.

No doubt its huge with good lighting , Ambience and Dance floor but the service is pathetic.
The Food is average and costly. Nothing great in drinks. Prices are all on a higher side. 
We just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place.

There is no point making such a huge place if you cant manage and talk to customers nicely. Not really sure if i would like to visit this place again even though its a hot property right now(now really sure why)"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Annu Priya,08 April 2019,4,Definitely one of the biggest clubs in Hyderabad. Lightning is good. Music is good as well. I guess food can be improved more. Slightly heavy on pocket side but definitely worth it.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Chirag Arora,08 April 2019,5,"This place is certainly one of my favourites in Hyderabad! Went there on a Friday night and the place was just amazing. The huge dance floor with the amazing lights set up is the best part about the place. The DJ and great crowd were like a cherry on the icing.
The food was good too, so were the drinks. This place is definitely a must visit, if you're a party person!!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Moumita Das,08 April 2019,5,Okay! Now Prism got the attention of Hyderabad. One of the best club now a days. The ambiance is crazy dope. They swirling light moves with music and trust me it gets you! The food is good and average restaurant style but this place is lit for partying. Have fun!!
Prism Club & Kitchen,Anoop Neelam,07 April 2019,5,"Had great time, this place & food here are awesome, nice place to chill with your friends. Appreciate Rahul(Star) for his patience and the hospitality"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Suman Mutyala,07 April 2019,5,"Cool place to hang out, food is good. Thanks to Rahul(Star) he is amazing guy, he was with us for our whole event & been very quick & supportive."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Priya Gupta,07 April 2019,4,Only place in Hyderabad with really good music to party. They have got huge dance floor with all the perfect light effects. Awesome crowd as well.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Pathakastha666,06 April 2019,4,"I have visited the place on 3 occasions, twice on weekends and once in weekday. Getting seats on weekends is very difficult. Also, the entry is charged for couple as well as stag, however it is covered in bill.

Pros:
1. Great ambience
2. Very big dance floor
3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4. Food is Fine.

Cons:
1. Uncomfortable sitting, especially if wearing short dresses.
2. On weekends, service is very slow.
3. Drinks are tooooo expensive and can easily cause a dent on pocket."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Ankit,05 April 2019,1,"Poor service, tasteless food. We went there for a corporate party, but even after paying too much we felt like its not worth even half the value."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Anuraag Ravi,05 April 2019,5,"Best night club in Hyderabad. Amazing hospitality, F&B and service. They have the best DJ's and recognized artists playing on a regular basis. Shoutout to the in-house DJ's who uplift the ambience with their groovy tunes. The confetti and the smoke guns are a visual treat. The centre lighting piece of the dance floor is spectacular and on of a kind (You will be glued to it). The crowd is sofesticated and a great experience to meet new people who enjoy similar taste in music. The owners have done a great job in developing the night life culture which Hyderabad was missing out on. The staff is always on their toes and are super friendly.

If you are a party freak or you enjoy good music with your drinks. This is the place to be. You will not regret it.

P.s- Space and breathing room is never a problem here and their washrooms are super clean and well lit."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Mohammed Talib,31 March 2019,2,"The new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its USP.

I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same. The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad. The light system and other props were good. It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam, Seoul. Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

Food is just average here. Starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. Main course was also not upto the mark.

Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service.
I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

I wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience.

Food: 2.5
Service: 1
Ambience: 4"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sugandha Saxena,31 March 2019,3,"Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space, and rightly so.

The place is located somewhere in Financial District, after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel. I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly, and the almost stranded road is of not much help. Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it, though conveniently covered by the bushes around it. Another 100m or so, you reach their parking yard, and finally the enter the premises after it.

A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena (for a lack of better word), that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor. The place has high tables next to the dance area, and then some couches on the far side. There is a beautifully lit up staircase, that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating.

And that is just one part of it. They have an outdoor seating, where the projector is put up for the match screening, and doubles up as the smoking zone. Apart from this, they have a pool, which would be apt for a private gathering.

I am no club expert, but their light system is sure one of their USP. The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening (it was a Wednesday), and did a decent enough job.

While the place is all decked up pretty well, the food on offer didn't impress me much.

üî∏STARTERS

üîπBurmese Roll with sweet chilli dip: A bit too oily, they were okay to munch on. They could have done with a bit more filling, though.

üîπPunjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip: Failed to impress. The paneer was too rubbery in some places, and in others, too charred. The lingering taste was merely of chilli, and nothing else.

üî∏MAINS

üîπPrism Special Veggie Lover Pizzaüåü: The dish that fared best with me. It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese. For the price, it may seem a bit costly, but quite worth it, as compared to other dishes.

üîπSpaghetti: Their take of spaghetti aglio olio, with mushrooms and black olive toppings. This was also decent.

üîπPenne Alfredo: This was just regular, nothing good or bad. And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread.

I didn't find the Indian mains anything great, and needs to be improved a lot.

The dessert was another downer. Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream.

From the mocktails section, I chose the safest bet Go Crazy. It was a twist on the oreo shake, with the inclusion of KitKat, but it wasn't great either. Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake.

If you are looking for a party place, that has a happening setup, good crowd and amazing ambience, this is your best bet. But for the food, it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas. They would give you the best value for money. The alcohol is also a little pricey, but you wouldn't mind that in a place like this."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Vivek Jain,31 March 2019,3,"By Invite

The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli, the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area. As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music.

The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights. The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs. The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this.

There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor.

Coming to the Food:

Punjabi Paneer Tikka (Rs. 325):
Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base. Was not soft and requires lot of improvement. A strict no to this dish.

Burmese Rolls (Rs. 275):
A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn, garlic and cheese. The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip. The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily.

Mains:

For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice, the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn't have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it.

Prism Special Veg Pizza:
The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served. The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either. The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders.

Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped.

Drinks:

Cucumber Coriander Mocktail: The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet. The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander.

Go Crazy:
The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake.

Recommended Dishes:

Burmese Rolls
Prism Pizza (If you need a main course)

The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life. So is not recommended.

Food: 3/5
Ambience: 5/5
VFM: 4/5"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Asha JS,30 March 2019,4,"Emerging as one of the best clubs in Hyderabad...............for those who love partying this place is indeed for you.

Plus points:-
1. Great space
2. Utilized well in terms of inner area, private section, seating's, lighting, DJ console, outer smoke area and swimming pool space for mini party gatherings and very important PARKING.
3. Dance floor is great, unless in lot of clubs its get so crowded and claustrophobic.
4. Bar counter looks absolute great.
5. Barmen showing all juggling skills, is eye candy experience.
6. Good varieties of drinks but they can improve on that part a bit.
7. Few good finger foods get you sorted for your party plans.

Minus :-

1. Food wise they need to improve as it's normal nothing special or different and price wise it's not that competitive.
2. Staff over here need bit of training in terms of hospitality, being rigid spoils the mood. A cute smile can change lot of things.............:-)

Starters :-

Chicken Lahsooni was good, garlic taste was evident but overpowered which is a good thing, served with mini papad rolls and chutney. Burmese rolls is something which I relished with corn and green chilies with some cheese stuffing it got in my favorite list. Fish fingers was too was decent enough. Pizza was good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as toppings were loaded, but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like. They certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka. 

All in all a great place for partying and events organised by Prism management - don't miss them at all. Monday to Thursday they mostly play Bollywood and commercial hits. Corporate crowd is regular as lots of Multi National Companies are in neighborhood. Friday to Sunday they have different themes like Electro, Techno and EDM so all those partyholics have a blast at this new place in Hyderabad.

Happy Partying Guys...........................:-)

Prism Club & Kitchen,Shreshth Malhotra,28 March 2019,4,"An evening well spent at Prism club and Kitchen. The place is situated relatively outside the main city in Financial district and has a huge area to offer. One can enjoy Poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the Dance floor. With big live screens and a great DJ, there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place.

Started my food experience with their Appetizers. I tried out their Punjabi Paneer tikka, Fish Finger, Lehsooni Murgh tikka and Veg Burmese rolls. The Punjabi Paneer tikka was good. It had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch. Served along with Onion salad and traditional mint chutney, one can give this dish a shot. Next up, their Fish fingers were quite normal for my palate. They could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option. 

My favorite dish of the night was their Lehsooni Murgh tikka. It had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender. The spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all. Veg Burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me. It had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided. They need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls.

For their drinks, I tried out their Cosmopolitan, Margarita and Passion. All the drinks were simply wonderful. It was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place.

For mains, I had their Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce with Rice, Farmer Chicken pizza, Penne white sauce pasta. Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce was good. I usually don't like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the Black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some Rice. Their Farmer Chicken pizza was too good. Loved the overall consistency of the dish. A slight work needs to be put up in their Pasta. I didn't find it much cheesy and tasty. 

The place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food. Great place for partying for sure. Happy eating. :)"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Pranay Bejjenki,27 March 2019,1,"Such a pathetic experience I had in this place. 
First, I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday. The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM. Once we reach there by 6:30 PM, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. ""I Don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early I am considering you and giving a table"". Is this how low they treat a customer? 

Secondly, When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. The manager or a person with attitude told us ""No, there are no seats available""(In a bold manner). When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available. I got pinched with irritation. Though, I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.

Finally, Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. And then, mosquitoes came into picture. There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON. Out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. They said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. I was like ""WTF"". I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place. Such a disappointing experience it was. I suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Raviteja Mallozala,25 March 2019,5,"Great place to party. Really Good experience. Lights, music, and visuals everything was pretty awesome. We went on Friday it was Bollywood night so had great fun. Must visit Pub and expensive too."

Prism Club & Kitchen,Rasika Bhagwat,22 March 2019,5,"A killer DJ, a thumping sound system, nice food! That summaries Prism. Went with a group of friends..we had a gala time.. unknowingly MC sher also came on the same day! The frenzy..the madness ...it was a great vibe! I am coming back here again!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Siddu,21 March 2019,4,"Very Pleasant Place little away from the City. Place was awesome. It was like a closed Theatre. Music was little boring. Tried Crispy Corn and Hyderabadi Chicken 65, taste was really delicious !!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Aprisyta,14 March 2019,5,"Amazing food. Amazing music. Amazing cocktails.

This is the place to be in Hyderabad. There's always something going on in Prism.

Food wise its good . Friendly staff and great service."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sunshine,12 March 2019,1,"It really been long time I have visited this place late review was busy with work
The place has got good dance floor... it has got many areas in it indoor... pool area ... garden area....
Visited this place for event hilight tribe booked a VIP pass entry ... from book my show app near the entry they taped a band our wrist after entering into the prism the managers over there and bouncers over there didn‚Äôt allow us to enter the area which was up , saying it‚Äôs full than okay den make us seat some where they where like stand near the bar counter it was so annoying we paid some 3000 rupees for vip entry per ticket and they don‚Äôt allow to vip area and say to stand near bar ... dan we asked the manager two give table he said u have to pay 10000 per table ..... I said it‚Äôs not mentioned in book my show app tat we have to pay for table and ur not allowing us to go up to vip area ...what is this he was like ur wish madam dan I said see we r all gals u should at least allow us to enter VIP area he was again like full dan we got really paronoid .... seee gals need safety we just can‚Äôt be in common crowd he didn‚Äôt understood tat also dan we had to make a call.... hope u understand DAN we got a table after a calll so cheap f these managers there....
than we got our personal waiter too after d call
My question is what about a common people who can‚Äôt make calls and get the work done so better develop ur managers if u have taken money for vip let d crowd enter into tat area if u don‚Äôt have place don‚Äôt issue tickets mention in book my show about booking a table separately for the amount make sure u serve the people for what u have told

The drinks and food was not that great it‚Äôs over priced compared to other top places in Hyderabad

Every one earns there money with hard work so the owner of the place plz do think f the common crowd u charge but provide dem for what u have charged hope u understand and make the changes
Place is good...."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sai Manjush,12 March 2019,5,"This is the best pub in Hyderabad ... food is so good ,huge place is available for corporate parties ,dance floor is lit with all the music and bass,very good friendly staff."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Barlapudi Manoj,11 March 2019,5,"Probably the best pub I had ever visited in the city..
Very spacious and one doesn't feel suffocated in here, unlike the other ""balocony/terrace-turned"" pubs here in the city!!
Haven't tried much of food!! But I liked all the chicken starters very much except for chicken 65!!
Would definitely visit again!!!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Charlie Burns,09 March 2019,2,"This place charges both an entry fee, and a cover charge. We ordered the wasabi prawns - what they delivered was great - but I tasted no wasabi so our order was clearly wrong. The cinderella mock-tail was insanely sweet, no one at our table could finish it. Despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table, they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they weren‚Äôt able to control with citronella sticks. The dance floor was very active with an amazing DJ, though not nearly enough AC so it smelled like sweaty guys."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Subhajeet Rout,09 March 2019,5,"The best place or rather I should the best pub in India....I really enjoy my weekend parties here...Whether its edm or bollywood or hiphop, this place is a blast...Ideal for any kind of parties...DJ Rabz is the resident DJ who does a really great job in keeping our feet moving and never lets the impulse go down...Keep it up Rabz and Prism!!!"

Prism Club & Kitchen,Akansha Chauhan,06 March 2019,5,"Super impressive ambience in this very spacious club. Loved it! A GREAT place for party. We tried paneer and broccoli in black bean sauce, tandoor stuffed mushrooms, white sauce pasta and some pizza. FOOD WAS AMAZING. Everything was very tasty. Definitely a place worth visiting.
TIP: PLEASE CHECK YOUR FINAL BILL TO MAKE SURE THE WAITER HAS DEDUCTED COVER CHARGES so you don‚Äôt end up paying more."

Anthony-Great ambience, would love to see managers like you in every pub."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Indradipta Sardar,01 March 2019,5,"This place was in my bucket list for quite some time. Visited there last week with my colleagues. This is the best lively pub I have been to in Hyderabad. The various lights create a different atmosphere and the dj was too good. Coming to food, the price is on the higher side but quality and taste is great."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sreeya Panda,28 February 2019,4,"So we had gone here in a group on a weekday and the overall experience was good. The main attraction was the huge space and the lights which already set the mood. The DJ was awesome even on a weekday with a mix of hollywood and bollywood songs. The taste of food was also good. The only problem we faced was the TAT for each order. We had to wait for like over 40 mins for each order to arrive. Also, there was a discrepancy in the bill which we realised only the next day. So better be careful before paying the amount. Also, the prices were little on the higher side. Happy partying!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Akshit Agarwal,28 February 2019,5,"India‚Äôs best club to do party on weekends, powerful light system, amazing drinks, highlife bar, super sound system, the poolside make feel so perfect after party. Just a word for Prism : ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Naveen Sagar,27 February 2019,5,"It was awesome having fun @prism great environment and one of the best pub I would say, Vamshi and Naresh were hosted wonderful services...!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Pooja Hakke,18 February 2019,5,"It is undoubtedly one of the best pubs of Hyderabad! Although the ambience is great and the food is d√©licieux, the lighting system steals the show. Best place for corporate parties vis-√†-vis other pubs in the city!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Soujanya Reddy,18 February 2019,5,"Awesome ambience, superb music, definitely a great and most happening place. Bit costly place I feel and crowded as well.

Perfect place for friday evening party!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Ishit Sharma,17 February 2019,5,Great place to hang out. Ample space for each table. Huge dance floor with amazing lights. Must visit #hyd. Come in numbers to enjoy to your fullest.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Subash,14 February 2019,5,With Deepak nice service. I went to this place for the first time and I have enjoyed it a lot. All of this wouldn't have been possible without deepak. His service and revocations made my visit extremely enjoyable.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Avinash A Naidu,14 February 2019,4,One of the best place in Hyderabad .Gud service and ambience . Best DJ around the world r playing . The magic circles make u mad lights gives u to bounce on the floor . Liquor prices r little high but u won't care to spend money for prism
Prism Club & Kitchen,Raju Rj,14 February 2019,1,"Worst Place , first of all it is in outskirts and the staff in the entrance they are least bothered about the customers, they are not professional , literally we came back without entering . All hype created ."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Varun Sharma,13 February 2019,5,"The first thing that one would notice after entering Prism is the area/size of the club.. I think it's the biggest club in India at least for me (based on my experience)... Everything from the music to food, service, interiors, area is great.. the attraction is the centre light that moves with the music/beats.. very big dance floor and good DJs..

Ambience- 5
Food- 4.5 for good snacks
Music- 5
Staff- 5
Hospitality- 5
Bonus- ample parking space with valet service"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Rmandava70,13 February 2019,5,Wow! It is amazing!! The place is huge and ambiance is too good. I guess one of the best party places in this part of Hyderabad. Altaf is at his best. He took us around and showed us a nice outdoor place. Karthik attended the table. He is an amazing guy. His service is impeccable. He suggested Mongolian chicken which is very fresh and tasty. Usually food at clubs doesn't really match the restaurant quality. But this is too good. Will visit again sometime soon.
Prism Club & Kitchen,GOUTHAM NANU,13 February 2019,4,"Visited this place today and it is located in an outlying area of Gachibowli. Food, ambience and hospitality was decent. There's private space available for private parties with a poolside bar counter."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Praveen Reddy,11 February 2019,4,"I visited this place last Sunday. Music is okay,But very big place like cinema theatre. Food was not much better,lighting was okay but not creative,service was good.Inside not smoking its bad thing. End of the day it's like build a club feel but not proper club feel."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Veggie-Lover,10 February 2019,3,"Big on ambience, food and music. Miserably fails at politeness.

Called up this place to reserve a table for two on a Friday night. They said please walk in. No reservations required for two. The place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation, and the ones remaining were well ‚ÄúAbout to be reserved so you can‚Äôt sit‚Äù. If you‚Äôre less than three head to the bar because that‚Äôs exactly where they like pushing everyone to.

The service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied .

The place is all lights and show and great for nightlife. The food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Raghav Heda,09 February 2019,5,The place on outskirts in Financial District. Have visited this place on February 1st DJ Suketu 1st Friday of 2019 with Office team. The Property is huge as you enter the Club. There not much seating for crowd as I have heard its biggest club in Hyderabad. The food was tasty and service very quick even after they have huge crowd. The staff is polite and helpful.. DJ Suketu was awesome he played superb Bollywood tunes. It has a seperate smoking zone outside which is good. Overall its good experience.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Mahesh Kumar,09 February 2019,5,"The place as you enter it, you can see how huge this property is.. The staff is very polite and helpful, their service is quick even after they have so much crowd... but there isn‚Äôt much seating for everyone to sit...my special thanks to prism and team and my specail thanks to Dear  Mr.Anthony thanks for such a beautiful night with loud good music and service."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Ramesh Bhaskaruni,09 February 2019,3,Food was decent and the starters were average. Location looks odd as its near the ORR and bit hard to find. Service was ok and the interesting part in the ambience is the roof top lights transforms it's shape with music.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Manoj Gangwar,09 February 2019,4,"Been there for my office party last week, ambiance looks good once lights are on. Loved the dance floor and DJ. Staff was professional and friendly . Food was ok ok."
Prism Club & Kitchen,G Rohit,06 February 2019,5,"Absolutely astonishing place to be when you wanna chill or party hard. Been here in December 2018 for Anjunadeep‚Äôs gig. It was worth the time. Food, ambience, people - everything was WOW. I really had a great time."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Nishith Vyas,03 February 2019,5,One of the best pub in Gachibowli. Killer ambience with awesome lighting and sound. Was there on 03-Feb-2019 and dj was Mariana Bo. Tracks played by her was so groovy and all beats were just apt for the night. Must recommend to everyone who like clubbing.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sunder Geddam,03 February 2019,5,Too Good.. i was here on 2nd Feb.. #DJMERINA is too good.. more over pub ambience is also good.. coming to price ..it's worth for what they charge there.
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sumitakela,02 February 2019,5,Such a beautiful place in Hyderabad . Love to bee here . Music are top of the city . Friendly staffs see you soon . Good thing it‚Äôs out of city see you soon .
Prism Club & Kitchen,Arha Krishna Inamdar,02 February 2019,4,"Its almost out skirts but a good place to hang out on week ends , space is lavish and ambience is great ! Best light effects and sounding systems !!!
Food is okay but I feel it was over priced"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Deepak Banka,29 January 2019,4,"Pros:
Awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
Cool ambience.
They always have the best DJs.
Cons:
Too much Vip culture. Almost all the tables are reserved. It's almost impossible to get a table. You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

But hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Karthik‚Äôs,29 January 2019,5,Prism it is!! One of the most happening club in the pearl city... amazing ambiance with a pretty huge dance floor which you cannot stay of out off bhoom!! Must visit place with a bunch of gigs! Bar counter is set up at its best.. good food for sure! Has a pretty big smoking zone which doesn‚Äôt make you suffocate lol! Must visit for sure with ya loved ones.. ‚úåÔ∏è
Prism Club & Kitchen,Ashok Choudhary,26 January 2019,3,"I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm.
It was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.
Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent.
Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising üòÇ even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people üòâ."
Prism Club & Kitchen,T Jyothi,26 January 2019,5,"I would say this was one of the best clubs I have visited in India. Lights, Music and the over all experience was extravaganza! Would love to visit this place again soon."
Prism Club & Kitchen,Roven Goutham Vanjari,24 January 2019,5,Food. Booze and masti all at the best price and lively atmosphere. One should surely visit. The place is best for youngster and the beer freak nice pitcher you would get here & my splz tankx to Vijay Kumar he served super & with splz items
Prism Club & Kitchen,Likita.chamakura,24 January 2019,4,"I have been to this place on weekday ... the ambience was really good but when it comes to the music , the DJ played only selected songs which didn‚Äôt give us an energy to enjoy the place ..! This was the main drawback to this place ..other than that everything was fine ..!"
Prism Club & Kitchen,Mrs.life,19 January 2019,1,Fine that you are taking cover charge but why are you deructing rs250?We did not get place to seat then why is this defuction?are you not going to take service charge?
Prism Club & Kitchen,Pranathi Aaradhya,18 January 2019,3,"Been here on a weekday. The ambience is mind blowing. The lights, they‚Äôll drive you crazy ( In a good or a bad way) I was disappointed with food and drinks. Ordered chicken 65 : was very bland, Cajun onion rings : these were decent, French fries : were saggy. The Dj wasn‚Äôt that great. All he played were punjabi songs. Overall, I feel like this place is over priced. The food and drinks weren‚Äôt worth it."
Shree Santosh Dhaba Family Restaurant,Sangam Khera,19 May 2019,1,"Irresponsible Restaurant . Please don't order any food from there. I ordered Mushroom masala ( not good in taste) and 3 different types of roti's and in place of roti's they people are delivering white rice.

Moreover , when I tried calling restaurant number , they are not in use."
Shree Santosh Dhaba Family Restaurant,Sandeep Sharma,10 April 2019,1,"I ordered food at 7 pm, but the delivery guy gave low quality food without Santosh dhaba logo and even bill was at 06:35 pm...

Shree Santosh Dhaba Family Restaurant,Dinesh Lodhi,10 January 2019,1,I have ordered twice from zomato. I don't know why they are so obsessed with oil. I found half of the container comes filled with oil only. I bet you can't chew their chapatis if you have teeth strong enough to break stones. Really bad quality food for health... They will surve just oil.. this oil I have removed from dal.. more than that came in paneer as well which I have ordered earlier few months back.

Dine O China,Pradeep Chakravarthy N,11 April 2019,5,"Authenticity...seafood must try. Not spicy, bland and pure Chinese. Schezwan chicken, corn mushroom fried rice, Thukpa, big bowl noodles...yum!"
Dine O China,Kanika Gautam,04 April 2019,5,"Its a nice place, good food and good ambience.

Ambience - ambience is good and contemporary.

Staff - staff is efficient, humble and very thoughtful. Ordered veg machurian but the manchurian balls were pretty hard. We expressed our concern to the staff. Staff, being very thoughtful, immediately replaced veg manchurian with the better version.

Food - You get authentic Chinese cuisines. Ordered veg dimsums/ momos, burnt garlic fried rice and veg manchurian with gravy. Everything turned out to be very tasty."
Dine O China,Ankita Shilpa,05 March 2019,4,"I went to this place for lunch with my mom and dad. The ambience is quite decent, with a lot of seating places. We ordered chicken coriander soup, golden fried prawns, a mixed fried rice and a plate of dry chilly chicken. Golden fried prawns were a bit plain, it could have been more flavourful. The soup was good. Fried rice and chily chicken were good in taste. All costed us around Rs. 1400. It was a light and good meal. I'd like to revisit this place again."
Dine O China,Sreekanth NK,20 February 2019,4,"Visited here for dinner. It was well decorated as it was Valentine‚Äôs Day.

Dine O China,Pallavi Tiwary ( FoodLicks),20 February 2019,2,"Though I love Chinese but this place was a big disappointment for us... The taste was too bad.. The price is high.. Lamb was not properly cooked.. It tasted like rubber.. Chilly chicken was so bland, Crispy honey chicken was not at all crispy. We had to ask them to re do it. Somehow they have not maintained thr quality nor taste."
Dine O China,Nandini Banerjee,19 February 2019,4,"Good food does the justice to your chinese craving,n nothing spellbinding but the bamboo rice must deserve a wow complement...it's a must try and that is the only reason I am giving 1 star extra"
Dine O China,Manojkumar D Nambisan,16 February 2019,4,"Good food, decent service. Not crowded especially for weekend lunch, ambience is average, worth the money. Is predominantly Chinese food and not pan Asian."
Dine O China,Soumi Mukherjee,16 February 2019,4,"This place gives you some really good chinese dishes and the portion size per dish is really good. The dumplings, noodles and fish main course are the best that I have tried here. The staff is also really helpful and quick with their service"
Dine O China,Nillu,11 February 2019,3,Interior and location of this restaurant is good but i didn't like food that much this place is near to my room so i thought of visiting once i ordered Manny items i didn't get satisfaction...
Dine O China,Rajashree Roy,09 February 2019,2,"I went there yesterday night with my friends around 10pm. They welcomed us by saying the starters won't be available, so we should rather start with the main course. Ordered veg schezwan rice, and pan fried noodles.,the food was decent. The funny part was as soon as the food arrived, they requested us to pay the bill. The food was okayish but we are thankful they didn't kick us out while we were eating.

In short, horrible service."
Dine O China,Prasenjit Ghosh,06 February 2019,5,"Ordered via switch. Phuket fish and mixed chilli garlic noodles. The fish was so tasty that we craved for more. And the noodles, never thought it can be this tasty from a restaurant in the south, without any south dish influence.
Must must try."
Dine O China,Abhishek Priyadarshi,05 February 2019,3,"Ohh finally the wait is over, I have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally I am at Dine O China. From outside it looks good. I got flat 50% offer from Dine out ""that's exciting""..

First thing to try was Chicken Tom Yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup I had for a while. And then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a Chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was HORRIBLE.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience I would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when I asked I got the reply that the Chinese chef has changed... And they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..

Now we have ordered

 Chicken drumsticks

Shezwan chicken dimsums

Singapore noodles mix

Chinese chopsuey

Yang Chow Rice

Schezwan Chicken

To sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks. 

Dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.

Singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.

Yan chow rice was good

So was Schezwan chicken.

Experience was decent I would say specially with the offer I got.. flat 50% off.

A loud shout out to the dine out team ..

I would wish to come again if I get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less Chinese restaurant nearby.. 

Thanks"

Dine O China,Ankita Sahu,09 January 2019,5,"By far the best chinese restaurant i have visited in Hyderabad. I have been there for more than 5 times or so and have never been disappointed.

That's how surreal has been my experience so far.."

Dine O China,Rajesh Babu,30 December 2018,5,"The decor of the restaurant is simply wow. The best part is that it has a live kitchen and we can see all the cooking procedures. Starters are excellent. We ordered drumsticks, seafood dim-sums . The main course has a lot of dishes. We ordered for bamboo rice with shredded chicken in hot garlic sauce. Food is great. The fried ice cream was amazing and worth trying . Overall we had a great dinning experience. Highly recommendable. Paradise for foodies."
Dine O China,Pratima Jyotsna,30 December 2018,5,"One of the few restaurants in the city which offers authentic Chinese cuisine. We had a pleasant dining experience.

Dine O China,Ashwin Govindankutty,14 December 2018,2,Pathetic service. Took an hour for the order to deliver even though there were only 2 tables occupied. No one has an answer for the delay. The entire eating experience is ruined. Not visiting the place again
Dine O China,Veerendra Chowdary,02 December 2018,5,Good quality sea food. I love mixed pan fried noodles the most. Too healthy food and the quantity is also good. I feel dine o China as the best Chinese restaurant available here

Dine O China,Mitesh Gupta,25 November 2018,4,"Had gone for dinner. Ordered Veg manchow sour, veg Manchuria, chilly paneer dry, Schezwan rice and chilly garlic noodles and assorted vegetables in choice of sauce. All veg. The soup had too much of cornflour was not that nice. Manchuria was ok ok. Chilly paneer, rice and the gravy were good. Could have been a little more spicy as had already requested them at the time of ordering. The service was quick and good and fresh as the restaurant was half occupied and they had good take away orders too. Overall a nice experience."
Dine O China,Nidhi Joshi,21 November 2018,4,"It was a date with my girls who wanted to eat Chinese so we decided to go to Dine O China for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have Chinese.
The restaurant is located in Gachibowli and is easy to drive to from ORR and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy Gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if I am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
We entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. It felt like by the women for the women. It felt comfortable that is all.
The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and I particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. We ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. Kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. They were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. Honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
For our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix Chinese chopsuey. Both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. But I would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. I find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
The mix Chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
For dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as I didn't like it that much.
Infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. And also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
We liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to Hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.

Pity Zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. Like I mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. We tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. All of which was great.
We asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
Definitely a must visit place. Will be back again when I am craving for some yummy Chinese food.

Dine O China,Shahbaz Shah,18 November 2018,4,no vinegar or soya sauce has been provided with the soup
Dine O China,Praju.pn,01 November 2018,1,Oh terrible pan fried noodles.. so salty and no spices whatsoever. Ordered pan fried noodles and what we received is a box of dry noodles and a box of cornstarch based salty soup infused with vegetables. There was no description of the dish to be like this on the menu. They might have other good dishes on the menu but pan fried noodles is not their specialty for sure
Dine O China,Rahul,14 October 2018,1,Bakwaas chilli garlic noodles... niether chili nor garlic taste
Dine O China,Naveen Kolluguri,14 October 2018,4,Went to this place on a Sunday night the place is small and it was crowded. We ordered Veg wontons for starter along with veg hot and sour soup both of them were good and then for main course ordered chicken Chinese choppsuey and it was very good. They were running some promotion for cool berg drinks tried there mint flavor and it was horrible
Dine O China,Swetha Mamidala,11 October 2018,1,The food was good every time but not this time. The chicken in the fried rice didn't cooked completely. It was very raw. And the chicken coriander lemon soup seemed costly and not worthy for price.
Dine O China,Kunal Agarwal,07 October 2018,4,"If you want to have some good Chinese in and around Gachibowli area, this place is good for you. The service is good , the starters and the noodles too and it will not take a pinch on your pocket as well."
Dine O China,Sree Leela,07 October 2018,3,Ordered thai green curry with jasmine rice and veg dimsum..both are just not good. Dimsums are very thick and also the suffing used is not upto mark...Thai green curry is very light and not so flavor full...
Dine O China,ABHINAV,17 September 2018,1,I ordered Thai green curry and this is what I received for 600 rupees. It's some aaloo curry with visible red chillies on it. Rice is the worst I have seen in my life. Worst experience ever.

Service was also really good.Visit the place and enjoy having the Chinese food.
Dine O China,Neelesh Shukla,24 August 2018,5,Order food online via Zomato. The food quality was really great and it was so delicious. Dine-o-china will be my destination for Chinese food craving. :)
Dine O China,Parmjit Singh,17 August 2018,4,"Its difficult to have authentic experience in terms of food, dine o china provides same experience. Each time i go back and try a new dish its adds to an amazing food experience.eating outside is not always about food but about the whole process. People working in dine o china are humble, smiling and patience. Go enjy food exp!"
Dine O China,Gourmet Hunter,17 August 2018,4,"We ordered simple non-veg dishes and liked the flavours they added to these simple dishes to make them taste good.
Egg fried rice is filled with fresh veggies, making it taste refreshingly good. 
Non-veg starters were also good. We ordered 2 varieties, one dry & one wet.  1 Fried rice quantity is sufficient for two.

Soft noodles, Fried rice & two starters curries is good for a group of 5.

Overall its a nice experience to have food from this restaurant."
Dine O China,Uddipana Goswami,13 August 2018,2,I went to this place as a part of our Sunday dinner. I already heard so much about this place from my friend. The taste of the food is no doubt good but I found stone in the soup I ordered. Thankfully it doesn‚Äôt go inside my stomach. Unfortunately no body bothers to say sorry they just gave 73 discount to us. The waiter was also very cunning first when we complained about the stone he said he will discount but later he came with the bill without discount. So we again asked him to give some discount then only he came up with new bill.
Dine O China,Lakshmi P,12 August 2018,3,"The ambience is really good. The staffs are very polite and their smile makes our day. The service is quick and amazing.
The food was okayish. Not that great though.
We ordered crispy honey chilli potato, chicken dimsums (must try), burnt garlic egg rice and lemon honey chicken."
Dine O China,Soumya Chatterjee,12 August 2018,4,Visited with my friend on a lazy Sunday evening to satisfy our craving for authentic chinese food. Ambience and service was really good! Ordered sizzlers and some chicken noodles. Found the both the dishes ordered to be sweet. Liked the food overall.
Dine O China,Swarn Lata Singh,11 August 2018,2,poor quality
Dine O China,Asfiya Kulsum,07 August 2018,2,"This is the third time I am at this place... the first two experiences were awesome... the food was really tasty and good at quantity.. but this time we faced disappointment... the food fish platter chicken drumstick n pad Thai for three was inadequate... the pad Thai of mixed variety was only of veggies...
The ambiance is as good as it was n the waiters were smiling n friendly
Hope they change to the way it was"
Dine O China,Archana Jha,07 August 2018,5,good
Dine O China,Nikhil Nikhil,06 August 2018,3,good but not spicy
Dine O China,Roma Haryani,01 August 2018,1,Ordered for a chicken sweet corn soup and veg fried rice. The fried rice was bland but bearable. The chicken soup was really bad. Safe to say this was the worst chicken sweet corn soup I‚Äôve ever had-taste and quality both.
Dine O China,Deepak Kancherla,26 July 2018,1,poor
Dine O China,Rishank Gupta,22 July 2018,1,pathetic chilli potato...looks like someone put sugar ayrup in it
Dine O China,Himanshu Singh,22 July 2018,2,Too oily for my liking
Dine O China,Siri Sha,20 July 2018,2,dint taste good at all... had food in dine o China before and was very impressed with the food.. but the ordered food tasted like roadside Chinese noodles...
Dine O China,Vamshee Devulapally,20 July 2018,2,the momos and spring rolls were good. but the rest were not. there s mushroom in padthai and it's too spicy (but not flavoursome). pad thais are meant to be tasteful with peanuts and flavours of spring onions. this padthai just has gun powder in it. the sauce for the noodles was so hot that the container almost melted and the taste of the sauce went bitter. I suggest that better quality containers be used for packaging.
Dine O China,Swapna,20 July 2018,5,satisfied with order and as well as delivery
Dine O China,SARDAR BHAGATH SINGH,19 July 2018,5,thanks....

Dine O China,PRABHJOT SINGH,15 July 2018,1,"Super poor quality.Also quantity is not at all justified.Need to have a quick check on this.Learn something from your counter vendors such as Mainland China and Chinese Pavillion.Sad , will never order and also will never suggest anyone to order from here. Lot of scope of improvement"
Dine O China,Debayan Roychoudhury,14 July 2018,1,there is a stone in the food.
Dine O China,Arnisudheendra1995,14 July 2018,4,it was nice..
Dine O China,Maheswaran Pandian,10 July 2018,5,"To start with, the service is really great. You might have to wait for a while but not for long. The food is just amazing especially the non vegetarian. Tried the vegetarian food here, it was good but non vegetarian items stole the show. Great food, great ambience and polite staff and management. Overall it's a great place if you crave for Chinese"
Dine O China,Yatin Dakhole,07 July 2018,4,"Ambience is good, food awesome. Try below.

Dine O China,Arun Balraj,07 July 2018,1,I DID NOT GET MY FOOD!!
Dine O China,Prachi,06 July 2018,2,I ordered broccoli and baby corn gravy. it was tasteless ..
Dine O China,Vivek Gudena,04 July 2018,3,"I was there today with three colleagues for lunch. The ambience was okay and there were probably more waiters than customers. We ordered the business lunch for two, one chicken option and another sea food option.

Of the four appetizers we shared, I loved the shrimp. Fish was good. I thought chicken was over cooked. We shared two sea food dishes, fried rice and noodles for main course. They were all okay. I asked if I could talk to the chef but was told he is too busy. That was a first.

The waiters seemed friendly and were smiling with the women wearing a bright pink lipstick that matched well with their outfits. Overall, nothing special and keep your expectations right."
Dine O China,Sushil Pandey,04 July 2018,5,"Looking for reasonably priced good Chinese food?? This is the place .
The wait staff is amazing, always smiling and very courteous. Food served is also well portioned and good in taste. Nice ambience and a good place for a quiet meal."
Dine O China,Shweth Trehan,02 July 2018,4,nice food!
Dine O China,Aditi Chakraborty,01 July 2018,3,"We ordered Hakka chicken, golden fried prawns, dimsums for starters. For Main course, ordered Chicken thai green curry. Hakka chicken and dimsum was good, golden fried prawns was not at all crispy. Thai green curry was very disappointing..it was disaster."
Dine O China,Jobin,29 June 2018,1,food packing was not at all done properly as all the oil from a non veg food was out in the cover and got mixed up the veg food
Dine O China,Shambhavi Singh,28 June 2018,2,"it was not crispy by the time it reached me.
I also requested a green dipping chutney which was not delivered"

Dine O China,Pawan Lakhotia,25 June 2018,1,ordered soup Veg Mancho soup bad quality no vegetables only thick Corn paste
Dine O China,Supraja.prasad,23 June 2018,4,"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Gachibowli -Hitech city area. Chilli paneer and chicken manchurian are great choices for starters. The momos are also good , huge and filling. The chilli garlic fried rice was flavourful but the Singapore noodles was just okish. We ended with fried ice cream and were totally satisfied by our choice.
Service is a little slow, this can be improved."
Dine O China,Ch Srinivas Rao,23 June 2018,3,American choupsey gravy was a bit sweet then it has to be
Dine O China,Rohit Gupta,21 June 2018,4,Had ordered Chilli Garlic nd Schezwan Noodles along with Veg Manchurian. All of them tasted good.

Dine O China,Kartik Balachandran,20 June 2018,5,Food very tasty..mongolian chicken quantity very less..not sufficient for even 1 person.
Dine O China,Alokdixit66,20 June 2018,1,The quantity given was less than a plate. It was not worth the price at all.
Dine O China,Dnishudnishu,18 June 2018,3,"Confused waiters.... half order .... items not available.... customization not available... ahhh total chaos.... but surely not truly Chinese... it's more northeast... nepali food as they are more on spicy and oily side. May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.
Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed"
Dine O China,Sathiya Parvathi,17 June 2018,5,I really loved it... must taste
Dine O China,Payel,17 June 2018,2,"I ordered chicken fried rice, there were not too much topins.."

Hyderabad Chefs,Samit,22 March 2019,2,"Went for quick lunch with colleagues for a farewell ....below avg ambience and dirty sofas .....food was overspicy and I feel they tried to mask the stale taste.....only reason restaurant, still alive is next to DLF....nothing else.."
Hyderabad Chefs,Manoj Gurrevala,01 February 2019,3,"Here, biriyani taste is nice. Must try ulavacharu flavour here. Nothing to say about ambience and nothing much to say about overall service."
Hyderabad Chefs,Prabhu,08 January 2019,4,I love to eat biryani in Hyderabad Chefs.Food is very tasty with effortable price.Zomoto deliver the order very less time.Thankk you zomato..
Hyderabad Chefs,Avishek Chakraborty,10 December 2018,2,The staff is not at all polite. Even we got dirty plates. Its one of the worst experience I had. I would suggest to order food from online if you wish to have food from here. The taste of food is decent but it has no ambience. In a way they charge more than the service they provide.
Hyderabad Chefs,Arindam,04 November 2018,5,"speciality restaurant offers signature Hyderabadi delights and north west frontiers dishes that make it an unforgettable dinning experience. For over decades now, this place has been serving food belonging to all the various places in the city. With the richness in the dishes and the care with which they make, it's an unusual experience"
Hyderabad Chefs,Pavan,05 October 2018,5,good
Hyderabad Chefs,Ismail Mohammad,05 October 2018,1,"Worst service and the food is pathetic.Biryani is not at all hot and the chicken is stored one which smells very bad.Coming to chicken Lollipop,When we ordered it he brought drumsticks and saying it‚Äôs lollipop.They are trying make customers fools and making cash for the ppl who comes as team outing on Friday.

Hyderabad Chefs,Vishnu S,25 September 2018,3,Ambience was quite simple like a Cafe and the order will arrive to your table quick fast. I have tried only chicken dum biryani (becoz my tummy was full) which was good but not great. It can be little more spicy and juicy.

It is more like a casual hotel, can't call it a restaurant as it have no ambience, not good tables and chairs. We had Butter Naan and Butter Chicken and the taste was good and service is also good. But the look of the restaurant should be improved."

But gradually restaurant failed to impress the employees and they are traveling again! :D
Nevertheless, Food is better especially the biryani.
Ambience is okay, and service could do a little bit better. They take a whole lot of time to get your ordered food on to the table.

One time visit.

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,YatenJaiswal,17 May 2019,2,Very limited menu for bar and food. Service is below average. In beers only KF avialble. For finger food orders they take more than 30 minutes. Food quality is below average.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rakesh,10 May 2019,2,"There is no dance floor. As per zomato it supposed to have live dj and dance floor but there were no such things. Food quality was not as good as expected. We ordered paneer makhan wala. Gravy was too sweet and paneer was stale..

Please check before going.."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dinesh Panpaliya,24 April 2019,5,"Awesome food nd Ambience
Must go place if you are staying nearby
They also have pub inside nd karaoke or other events going on
Also the food served is good in quantity"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vishnu Kaluvala,21 April 2019,5,"We went last night to have couple of drinks after hectic schedule, this place is for the people who love to sit outdoor with good live music with Bollywoods....the service quality of drinjs was nice ."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dijin Dan,15 April 2019,5,"This is a gem of a place in the busy hitech City, love the live music that happens there on weekends. All the starters and main course are top class. No complaints here. The waiters take extra care of you inside. So extra points there for sure."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kiran Reddy,08 April 2019,2,"Very laid back staff. We ordered chilli toast and got the order served after half an hour. Just to toast a piece of bread they took 30 minutes literally. I had to follow up twice or thrice. The cocktail wasn‚Äôt better either. It tasted just like water with a hint of vodka. And I had to ask for sauces to go with the fish I ordered. No side fresh salads or sauces to go with the main. The fish tasted good, though it was slightly over cooked. They can improve their service levels to a great extent. And also their food. It somehow gave me a feeling that they didn‚Äôt bother about the customers."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Surya.nandu.SN,03 April 2019,4,I‚Äôve been here for the new year party and it was fun. Moreover it was effordable. It‚Äôs a cozy place and the crowd is decent. Music is good and the food is good.

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Frenchmanms,29 January 2019,5,"Been there a number of times and absolutely no issues any time. I love the ambience, especially the couches on the mezzanine floor. Drinks are made well and food is generally good."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kavish Jain,26 January 2019,2,"Went this place for my friends birthday,although it was weekday so crowd won't be that loud. I found this place ok for chill out not much happening as well. We sat outside in open area which was good, also it was but chiller that day so moonsoon was really awesome. Now coming to food and other stuffs. As I am complete vegeterain one incident happened that day like we ordered two veg pizzas there and confimed the ordered twice to waiter..first pizza was correct and good but second pizza we told him to get it after some time.as.he served there was topping on pizza which was looking like carrot,but as I had some confusion with that thing,I closely looked and saw it was not veg , I told to re-confirm in kitchen so it came out to be non-veg it was pork or something like that. I was very dissapoint with the management and post that no came to feel sorry as well with wrong that giving on our plates. I was totally disappoint with instance giving low rating and also very bad experience. For other thing i ordered the food was good."

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ankurjyoti Bordoloi,10 January 2019,4,"My evening watering hole while at Holiday Inn in Hyderabad. Good pizza, and a decent selection of drinks. The music is okay, tends to get a bit too loud later, but there's always the outside seating for the quiet-ears."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ashima Singh,06 January 2019,4,"It was nice and Happening place. The crowd is nice. Food is 3/5, Ambience is 4/5, service is 4.5/5. Over all a perfect weekend (or even mid week) party place."

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vasanthan Lr,11 December 2018,4,"The things which impressed me was the the cocktails based on seven sins. The ambience is calm and soothing for people who don‚Äôt like bustle in a bar.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not a bar for partying, it‚Äôs bar to chilling‚Äô"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Bhameetha Burla,05 December 2018,1,Worst place and worst service.. without any prior intimation they stopped taking orders.. for a crispy corn they took 1 hour.. will never recommend this place..
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Jessie,02 December 2018,2,The dj isn't great. There wasn't much crowd though it was a weekend. The drinks are just fine. Service is good. Dj and ambience have to be improved a lot.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anish Patwardhan,30 November 2018,4,"I was staying at holiday inn for one month, so this is the place where I had my first party in Hyderabad, so this place will remain always special to me. Also we had many team parties over here.

They have 'Drunch' on Saturday and Sunday , it's like unlimited drinks and starters. Also on weekdays they have karaoke and live music. One of the good party place in gacchibowli. They even have outside seating area.

Overall a perfect party place!!!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sai GaneSh ChiNta,25 November 2018,4,"Will recommend this place for Friday after-office parties. The Hummas and Pita bread here is just heaven. Also, the crispy corn is just yummy."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sudip Mukherjee,25 November 2018,2.5,Felt like i was attending a marriage reception on a saturday night. This place has changed quite a lot over the years or maybe the timing was not right!
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Asha Akunuri,16 November 2018,5,"Such an amazing place definitely a 5 rated ü§©ü§©
There is indoor and outdoor seating . The outdoor seating was too good . As we have been here during evening the cool breeze was soothing .
The service is quick n fast and the staff was very friendly .
We have ordered chilli chicken , onion rings , pizza , fish fingers all are equally delicious .
Ambience :4/5
Service : 5/5

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shiva Chary,30 October 2018,5,"We are visited komatose Holiday Inn inn Express
My small party nice place nice ambience live music good food was excellent nice service staff very friendly we enjoyed hangout party fully awesome"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Tanusree Chakraborty,25 October 2018,5,Excellent food n drinks....amazing atmosphere...loved it.i had opted for buffet with drinks.....would have loved to have a bigger dance floor.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Juhi Nayak,20 October 2018,2,"The bar ambiance is good. We ordered chilli broccoli and that had mix of broccoli and cauliflower. Broccoli was tasty!!
It is at the outer area so there was problem for booking a cab also at 8:30 pm while returning"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Gourav Gupta,19 October 2018,2,"We went there yesterday and as usual they did not have many foreign beers present but mentioned in menu.

Second they provided custom menu for Zomato gold and asked to get free drink only from that menu. Zomato gold and this restaurant is not good as they keep changing conditions and we customers suffer. Zomato says you can get free dish from complete menu and
manager said no we can only give free dish from custom small menu"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Appu Ashok,13 October 2018,3,"Good place to hangout in gachibowli. Crowd was average, but ambience wasnt what I expected either. But good food, not budget friendly but worth it as its so yummy.
Has a dance floor, but we need to book it earlier it seems not open for all. That's disappointing."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Saurabh Mishra,13 October 2018,5,"Komatose, Holiday Inn, is a place which will guarantee you a great time...whether you're in group, or alone.

The hospitality of the staff, especially of our usual host Balia Nima is a delight. His pleasing personality and positive smile is one of the things which makes this place special. The skipper Abhivir Singh (hope I spelt correctly) is a delight to meet everytime!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Prashant Pathak,03 October 2018,4,"Nice ambiance but not very beautiful, must try pizza it was awesome. Music is good with sound system very gentle to ears. Overall it was good."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,ASH&B2,02 October 2018,3,"Please don‚Äôt visit this place as a part of official team lunch. We sat in komatose but food buffet was from johnathans kitchen. seating is comfortable for drinks but not for having food. staff was busy serving alcohol as it churns more money, we were ignored big time and were even charged 100 rupees for one kinley bottle. air condition was switched off probably hence we were sweating profusely. My first experience of komatose and johnathons kitchen was bad and would neither visit or recommend anyone for this place."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ramit Khurana,28 September 2018,1,"Pathetic service. No point in visiting this restaurant during the happy hours if they are going to refute the orders. No drink available, no starters available, waiter is giving stupid excuses about not serving food before happy hours. What is this service? Why do you even have happy hours when you don‚Äôt want to serve the happy hours menu. Very poor customer experience and never going to visit this place again in future. Tagging Bishwajeet Jha"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Chaitanaya Rama Seshu,23 September 2018,5,"Nice place to hang out with friends. Pop up a beer. And have a blast. Given it is so close to office space. We were served by Balia lima who took care of everything we wanted with a smile making our day the best.

Cheers!!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ravi,23 September 2018,4,"Happy happy hours

They know how to make you happy during the happy hours. Food is tasty and right sized portions! The service needs a little up lift!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dpk,23 September 2018,1,"Had a terrible exp on Saturday night (22nd Sep). I have been quite regular To komotos on Friday eve woh my office colleagues and had good exp so far. Tonight I recommended this place to my friend for dine out.

When my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no ala-carte tonight. Only option is buffet. So they started with buffet. When I reached it a little surprise to me and I checked with the manager there Mr. Abhiveer. He also denied about the ala-carte. So we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that ala-Carte is also there and three ppl lied to us. As I am a big fan of their Hamas and pita dish I asked for the menu and Mr. Abhiveer is sayin we don‚Äôt have menu, please check the menu in Zomato. What? Who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough?

Buffet food options for vegetarians are very less. Their dessert spread was good though.

Their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff. After asking numerous time for spoons and tissues, this is how the tissues were served to us on the table (plz refer the pic). We had 3 kids with us, imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner! üòÄ

BIG NO TO PPL if you want to have just one or two dishes there. We got trapped today."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Shobhit Sinha,21 September 2018,5,"This place is love. It's your everyday bar.
This place not just welcomes regular customers but make the leave a mark, literally. You'll find name plates of it's regular customers all over the bar. And their bartenders absolutely know how to keep the customers happy. This is one place where you will find more people sitting at the bar, rather than the regular seating arrangement it has.

Sonu being their star bartender, you'll find almost everyone calling him out for their drinks and he absolutely takes care of all his regulars with a smile. We usually order a whiskey sour and sangria, being our absolute favorite. Accompanied by crispy corn and their signature pizza, which is baked fresh out of their Jonathan's kitchen.

If you're a party animal you'll find this place a hit on Thursdays where they take their ladies night very seriously. All drinks on the house.

I'd absolutely recommend this place, if you're looking for your next regular bar.
As the saying goes ""You should always be a regular for more than one bar"" and this should absolutely be on your list."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Aishwarya Suresh,17 September 2018,5,"Visited for a dinner with family! Loved the options available on the menu, the ambience and the courteousness of the staff. Food was yummy and I must say the playing was fabulous!! Hats off to the chef!! A must visit.."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Satyen Rai,16 September 2018,4,"Komatose turned out to be a nice little place. The food/drinks, the ambiance, the live music* ‚Äî everything was nice. They have great options for both buffet and a la carte. They even have an open sitting area which adds to the overall appeal.

Recommendation ‚Äî a must visit if you are in the area.

* The live music is available only on Saturdays ‚Äî as far as I know."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Pranjal Shukla,26 August 2018,5,"Fantastic Place to hangout with your buddies. The cheapest beer in whole of Hyderabad as per the hotel standards is here.

They also have a seating area outside which is like a tent.

DJ plays good music and a visit during sports season must not be missed."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anish Mahapatra || Thefoodpotato,26 August 2018,4,"Located inside Holiday Inn, this place is decorated decently well. I enjoyed the seating, music and decor. The service for me was average unfortunately. It was difficult to catch the waiter's attention. The drinks were decent and the food was a little oily for my liking. Overall, it was a nice place and isn't as expensive as I had initially expected. Also, Zomato Gold is always a wonderful added advantage üòä"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Abhijit Benerjee,17 August 2018,5,"Komatose in 2017 was a very happening place for promoting psychedelic music culture, I had one of the best after parties here... the music used to be loud and blasting till 4am.. In recent times I've not heard anything about komatose but I still have a feel for the place and the vibes are too good !! üòÅ indoors and outdoors"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ranjana Chakraborty,16 August 2018,3,"The place is good. Jonathan's kitchen(restaurant) is attached with that. You can have dinner over there.

Bad thing- services are very slow. You will feel like you are in restaurant not in the bar. The music is also not good according to the environment."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rakhi,13 August 2018,1,Worst ever experience booking this place for corporate dinner. They do not have any courtesy and sense when they talk to the customers. Reservation team had no intention to do business. We would never ever recommend this place to anyone.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ravindra Jayanti,13 August 2018,1,"Booking a place here for a corporate package is absolutely horrendous. They provided the menu and package details on Friday and confirmed its available, and on Monday ( the day of the event ) Management was rude and was insisting they‚Äôll not provide the buffet but will charge the same price as per the package. They did not have minimum courtesy and were not even respecting the fact that our manager ( a lady ) was trying to talk. This is probably the worst ever team I had ever talked to. Very disappointing. This has resulted in cancellation of our corporate party which consisted of several partners and managing directors. I‚Äôd never recommend this place to anyone."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Avin Seth,07 August 2018,5,"A great place, always leaves us with good memories at the back of mind. Still remember I was here for my first drinks date with my now wife and then girlfriend. A great place with good vives, coperative staff and great ambiance. The crowd is great at this place, what can one expect from Holiday Inn....
Guys and gals be at this place to make best of yoit memories..

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sandeep,04 August 2018,5,"Great Service as the staff is very friendly and gives a personalised touch to your evening, the ambiance here is outstanding it gives a different vibe all together. This is one of the only bars in the city where even if you come alone you will end having a great time and find great company for yourself without fail. Food is something to try, the new menu is out of this world, I tried the kumbh ke Galaoti and Murgh Malai Tikka and they were finger licking. I would give them a 6 Star!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vishwajit Rana,03 August 2018,3,"We Booked a table at 5.45 but They dint have any data regarding our booking at 8.15PM.
We were made to sit at 2 tables before allocating one. This took about 20mins. We would have went to another place but #hiteccitytraffic.
Happy with the Service & the food."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Parinit Agarwal,03 August 2018,3,"Went there with some work friends. The place is cozy and attracts business crowd. The food is good for bar menu. The service could have been better. We had to reach out to the staff multiple tomes, to the extent of walking up to them to ask for stuff.
The ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it is ok."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Produtoori Ankith,28 July 2018,5,"You know what is the best part of hospitality? Fulfilling every silly need of the customer, absolutely loved the service kudos to the staff, I can't say enough of their service, well done there, a small suggestion add some dishes other than panner in vegetarian(I want you to take this seriously and implement it in the buffet ) other than that no complaints... You guys are awesome
We will keep coming back there no stopping us ...
Keep feeding us the way u r doing it,
Great stuff"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kritika Kumar,27 July 2018,3,The ambience was good but bar tenders were rude on ladies night. Treating us like they are the ones sponsoring us drinks. Need to improve their service
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Bhavya Tyagi,22 July 2018,4,"What to say this place blew me away from the moment I entered.
Went there after attending a comedy gig and this place continued the fun.
The band ""Aatish Official"" were rocking that day. Never heard the better band then them in any pub in Hyderabad. I dont have words to praise them enough.
Coming to the food , it was delicious and the quantity were sufficient.
Staff was good and took care of us well even though the place was crowded.
The only thing to be improved is that the Manager n bouncers should be able to handle the drunk persons better. There was a group of people celebrating a birthday but they were all over the place. They were disturbing the band and also other people just couldn't get on dance floor. Thats the only thing due to which I am not giving this place a 5. Hope it doesnt happen again when i visit next and also hope ""Aatish Official"" are there when i come."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vidhi,18 July 2018,4,We had an awesome experience there..with live music and friendly ambience..Loved the live music numbers..not too much options in veg though but good to sit down and relax after a tiring busy work schedule
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suyog.pathade2012,17 July 2018,5,"Excellent place for hangout‚Äôs with friends, very nice ambient and the rocking live music. Awesome food and drinks. also perfect for your date."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Saikat Dey,15 July 2018,1,I usually dont write reviews. This is perhaps my first one and you should probably guess the level of my frustration with this place. Just one word...small and deplorable. Cold food and poor service sums it all. Quite surprising that this is part of an elite chain...actually shocking. Have spare money...go to a better place....not this one.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Raj,02 July 2018,4,This is right inside the holiday inn.. liquor is cheap compared to other joints. DJ is fantastic .. just ensure there are no office parties going on so that you won‚Äôt be left out.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sahu Santosh,22 June 2018,3,Ambience is okay .. no dance floor .. average music . No energized atmosphere . A class place for people who want to drink in peace .. paneer was good .. peanuts were good
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sriker Kammisetty,19 June 2018,5,Great place with nice ambience...Cocktail's was amazing!!! Mouth watering food with neat service. Nice place to hangout with friends & family too.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Safi Hussaini (thexperimentaljugaadi),19 June 2018,5,"Been here on a weekend with friends as this is attached to JK , Ordered a Red bull , Grilled Murrel With Herb Rice and Dragon Prawns FYI- I am a seafood lover . Coming to the review of each - Murrel was grilled to perfection , the way I like it with some veggies , Murrel is my favorite fish and it needs to be cooked perfectly to enjoy its taste and it was made too good , this was served with rice and some veggies , Coming to Dragon Prawns again perfectly cooked and made to perfection . Komatose as a place is good to hang out with friends and enjoy after a tiring day / weekend the staff here is friendly and moreover the managers are welcoming and helps you out on your selection according to your mood / taste ."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,18 June 2018,3.5,"Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be, happened to be drizzling, which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas.

Inside was a pretty small area for a bar, but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above, overlooking the area below. Lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. üíì

Being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all. The most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of Koma' menu. The taste was as described on the menu. Lust in particular was something different I'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusionüå∂Ô∏èüç∏.

The appetizers we had we're really good, something I enjoyed more than the alcohol.
Dragon prawnsüç§, Grilled pomfretüêü, Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders! Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.

Best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush üçπ.

The service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! It's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'Comatose' üòâ.

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
VFM - 3.5/5
Service - 3.5/5"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Neha Patnaik,17 June 2018,5,"It's my 3rd visit to koma and this time I couldn't try much of their drinks but this is a place where you actually can party and and chill at the same time
sitting in cabanas just outside the door. If you're are party freak, you would like to be inside but who can deny to a live music and enjoying a lovely time with your gang.

The drinks I liked where Virgin Mojito, Lust and Gluttony. All of them were quite different from each other and tastes really well.
Special thanks to the guy who prepared all of these drinks.

Overall: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5 ( if you're on a weekend)
Drinks: 5/5"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Food We Love,14 June 2018,3,I have been here couple of time!! The inside seating is very small but the DJ is good. They have beautiful outdoor seating. Food wise it‚Äôs average nothing fancy about it. It‚Äôs a place to just hangout with friends and chill. Expectations for high quality food should not be there.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suri,12 June 2018,1,"No option to give zero or less.. visited the place with friends during the happy hours..

Food and drinks: friends has opted for whiskey and myself has ordered for mocktail, requested for less sugar syrup , which was not honoured at all... Food portion was so less that a kid can gulp it at one go.. some of the items were reheated and served..

The biggest surprise came along with bill , they thought the group was drunk and no matching to the number of drinks ordered Vs Billed.. serious integrity issues.. we called them to correct which took good amount of time, least bothered to apologize or explain.. NO GO place..blocked the place.."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Hemant Rao,08 June 2018,2,The management is naive and doesnt know how to keep the place happening. The happy hours timing goes for a toss as they have limited or better to say nothing at disposal during that time. Only your frustrated mood can save your day and only focussing on your drinks is the thing you could do here.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Krishna Kant Chaubey,08 June 2018,5,"Visited this place with friends and loved the overall experience. They have a great DJ and also live music space . They also have an open space where you can hangout with your friends and enjoy fresh air. The service is awesome and very dedicated to customer satisfaction.
Tried Greed among the cocktails which had the base of whiterum , brandy along with lime and orange, one of the 7 deadly sins of KOMA. Among the mocktails had Blackcurrent , lime and peach and also green apple(prepared on request) which were cool enough to have. Among the starters we tried fish , chicken , prawn dishes. Overall a very nice experience ."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kirti Singh,01 June 2018,4,"Good food
Awesome ambience
You will enjoy very much
If somebody else is paying the bill.
There s nothing better than a sponsored lunch.
Quality nice"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sugandha Saxena,28 May 2018,5,"Few weeks back, after a tiring day out, we decided to spend the evening at Komatose. Choosing to sit outside, we got to know that they have Grill and Chill Saturdays. The live music for that night had been set outdoors. The weather being fairly pleasant, it was good to hear Atish dole out melodious numbers one after the another. Got a request? He would be more than willing to fit it in!
Coming to the food, after a long time I had a great Paav Bhaji. This was part of the live counters there. I hasked for some extra butter on paavs, to which the cook readily complied :D
Another live counter had paneer and veg rolls. Tried the paneer one, and liked it. For the mains, you have a lot of options to choose from. Do give the pizza a try.
The desserts are another wide spread. You find both desi and fancy desserts. I tried the blueberry cake, kiwi mousse, fruit cake, orange cake, brownie, burfi ‚Äî everything was so well done!
All in all, do visit the place on a Saturday, to have a gala time.

~By Invite"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Jitesh Daga,25 May 2018,4,"Few days back, ended up at Komatose, where they were having Grill and Chill on Saturday night. We sat outside, where there was live music. With light winds and good company, along with melodious music, the setting was perfect to unwind. The food that I tried included Pav Bhaji, Paneer Tikka, Tandoori vegetables, and corn. Special mention to the dessert spread that had Kiwi Mousse, Fruit Cake, Brownie, Blueberry cake, orange pastry to name a few.
Highly recommended for a good time with good food!"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mali Naveen Reddy,23 May 2018,5,"Cool place to visit, Large screen available for IPL Tip: Accepts deals on Little App and also they provide Peanuts :PNot sure about the weekend rush."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mangesh Vinchurkar,04 May 2018,4,"Ambiance is really good and it's very close to financial district. restaurant staff is very helpful and polite. I visited this place many times for corporate lunches. You will get verity of options for lunch. Food is tasty and less spicy. Lunch cost around 1000 per person.

once I visited this place for dinner and got to know that they serve very few options for dinner buffet. Dinner buffet is usually for their resident guests and it cost around 700 per person. Though you can enjoy a la carte. Restaurant also have full bar available.

every day 4pm to 8pm is happy hour. Zomato gold option is not available."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Lalit Pathak,25 April 2018,3,These stars are just for the food and drinks. I just don't like the service and attitude of the staff or rather just our luck that we encountered the same person twice. Almost threw the order on the table when prepared. Even the food he served was without any accompaniments that were supposed to be there. Drinks are good..food is ok..zero stars for the service!
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sunny Handa,25 April 2018,4,"Been to this place on saturday, music is awesome. Ambience too gud. Liked the food also specially the pizza. Nd Dj is the best part of it. Dnt forget to be there on saturday night as Dj Deep plays some of his awesome tracks which makes u go even more mad"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Sagar Sandesh,24 April 2018,4,Good place to spend time with friends and colleagues.. DJ is great.. and loved the bar structure..service was quick and staff were quite interactive. would like to appreciate Anmol the bar staff.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Pranjali Srivastava,22 April 2018,3,The ambience is nice but overall experience on a ladies night was not satisfying.I ordered double deck pizza with LIIT.The food was delicious.The music was good.
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Foodie Girl,21 April 2018,4,"After a very long time came across a place where trending Bollywood numbers are also played, the food is great! The music may be loud if you wish to have a good discussion with your folks but overall a nice experience."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Gaurav Agarwal,20 April 2018,2,"For vegetarians,
I feel place is definitely overrated. Not much options available. Taste is kind of ok, not great definitely. Price don't go well with the food.
I doubt Zomato ratings seriously."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Addie B,12 April 2018,3,"Komatose! Sigh.... :(
I had high expectations by seeing the rating but unfortunately the menu, place and the crowd was very dissapointing.
We like the fried Mozzarella... couldn't find anything better or unusual :/
Well this is not a separate restaurant, they use one single restaurant by two names.
ONLY WHAT MADE ME GIVE A 3 RATINGS was the LIVE MUSIC (bollywood beautiful voice of the singer)
Sorry Komatose üôè
Aditi"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Satwinder Singh,09 April 2018,5,"Well next to Jonathans Kitchen is this place to down a few.
Komatose is a good crowd puller, with plenty of weekend party groups and people from nearby IT companies.
The team at the bar does a phenomenon job. Their interaction with guests is over the top, no wonder I heard of people visiting this place almost every day of the year.

Also, from my experience, this is one of those few places where the Sound Acoustics are so well designed that its loud yet comfortable. You will not come out with a sore throat.

The food comes from its sibling Jonathans Kitchen, so we know it can never go wrong. About the drinks, well what could go wrong with them ! ) and Oh ! did I mention the Cheese Chilli Toast.. Its Different.. Try it..

The outdoor cabanas can seat about 8 ~ 10 people each, wonderful for the evenings.

Great Music with shows on specific days of the week.

Draft is served, but tends to vanish Quickly :) 

This place is a full package.

Drinks - Hic Hic
Food - 5 / 5
Ambiance - 4.5 / 5
Service - 5 / 5"
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Siddharth Singh Gaur,08 April 2018,4,"This is a perfect place to hit after day's long work. It has enigmatic and soothing ambience.

The service is quick. The gorund floor is a seating near Bar counter and then there is first floor with a big screen for live streaming. All in all a rocking place."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Dheeraj Burugadda,26 March 2018,5,Been to this place and Wonderful place to hangout with friends. Food is amazing as usual.Got a great offer from little application and thoroughly satisfied
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Vam'c Krrish,25 March 2018,5,"best place to be for Saturday nights, these guys nailed it when it comes to their package. my friend suggested this place for dinner tonight and I simply cannot ignore their outdoor grills, more over they have Dj at the bar and live music outdoor. this gives you options to choose. cudos to the bartenders they made our day even better."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Caleb David,11 March 2018,2.5,"Friendly staff, good live music and decent food. You can go enjoy the live music with decent food and drinks but for sure not a place for a great party. This place lacks life in it, you get depressing feeling if live music is not playing."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ryan Cylo,31 January 2018,4.5,nice place for classy... the place was small but it looks cute... one thing is they dont have separate washroom for bar.. by the way i love this place i want to visit again...
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Kapeesh Bansal,26 January 2018,4,"Food :4/5
Drinks:4/5
Ambience :3.5/5

Their happy hours are good. You save a hell lot money at that time.
Food is really good.Drinks are also good.
Do pay a visit. Just go well before 8PM if you want to enjoy happy hours because they don't allow bulk ordering in happy hours, only after you finish your drink they'll get another one."
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suresh Jena,15 January 2018,5,"Awesome place to hang out with friends... Specially the bar and the bartenders.... Anmol And Asif... Really amazing cocktail maker... Food also really good and value for money... Awesome crowd... Overall... Must visit.. If you want to hang out with friends for drinks, food and dance..."
Aromas@11SIX,Priyank Almal,05 May 2019,3,"This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.

Food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.

Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..

With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..

Hope the management would rethink.."
Aromas@11SIX,Onefussyfoodie,03 May 2019,5,"This review was long due. Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in Gachibowli. The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.

Coming to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google, unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. Simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. It gave a heavenly feeling. Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali. I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well.

Butter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha. It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken. Seemed like a match made in heaven. Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani. As is known from my reviews I don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice. The taste was good and to my liking. Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good.

Thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen. They offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. Thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food. We shall be back again."
Aromas@11SIX,Sruthi Rao,27 April 2019,3,I've ordered Chinese nonveg combo from this place ...it's basically veg fried rice with chicken Manchurian gravy....the foods aroma was awesome.... however the vegetables were undercooked and spoilt the taste of the food... However I really liked the food...it was flavourful..will definitely order from this place again
Aromas@11SIX,Yuvan Kumar,21 April 2019,4,The location is not so okay. I found that most of the people weren‚Äôt there. The quantity of the chicken biryani we ordered was a lot. The chicken starter is also tasty. Must try biryani but prices should be reduced.
Aromas@11SIX,Deepank Joshi,17 April 2019,1,"I did not like this place at all. This restaurant do not match zomato gold standards. First thing , the price and ambience do not match at all. This place looks like a shady dhaba from highway but prices for food compares to ohris restaurants.

Even if we ignore prices , taste and services are worst that I have encountered in any Zomato Gold restaurant.

This place do not deserve 4+ rating. Totally disappointed.

-Deepank"
Aromas@11SIX,Chaitanyavarma Vadapalli,07 April 2019,2,Food is over rated and service should be improve a lot.Food item cost doesn't match provided taste. Over all bad experience.Management has to look into these issues.
Aromas@11SIX,CHAKRAVARTHI KADALI,05 April 2019,2,"What you people are doing
two times I get wrong items from you
why you people are sending wrong items today I given
Order
1 mushroom masala
2 paneer butter masala
But you people are send biriyani and sum curry"
Aromas@11SIX,Mahendra33196,31 March 2019,1,Worst food. 150 ml coke costs 60/- Worst Serving and very arrogant attitude... Avoid visiting this place...! Manager is not available all the time.
Aromas@11SIX,Sashibhusan Pandey,28 March 2019,3,The quality of food they are offering has degraded. I was the one who wrote good feedback about the restaurant once and was a frequent visitor... But now because of poor quality offered twice I stopped going there
Aromas@11SIX,Finny Chellakumar,24 March 2019,3,"Have visited this place few times last year. This is a decent dine-in joint. The food you get here is a normal indo-Chinese food, which any Chinese restaurant would serve. If you want VFM, go there and dine-in. Have always felt that the quantity of takeaways are less than dine-in. The picture is a quantity you get for 320 bucks dish!"
Aromas@11SIX,Mitali Agrawal,22 March 2019,3,"I order from this place all the time, never visited though.
Food 4/5
Price 3/5 overpriced.
I really liked there Paneer biryani and all starters."
Aromas@11SIX,Foodloverrr,11 March 2019,5,I ordered a dish which is not there in the menu. There were kind enough to make it for me. Paneer was soft and gravy was rich. Thank you we enjoyed it. Will definitely order again.
Aromas@11SIX,Raja Gopal Reddy Chereddy,03 March 2019,5,"Must try
Food is awesome in terms of taste and quality and quantity also.aromas special chicken briyani must try item in menu of you are biryani lover.
Only one thing service is very slow because of love kitchen.2 hours for lunch or dinner
Place is small but good"
Aromas@11SIX,Somshankar Naik,01 March 2019,2,"Food tastes good here but when you see surroundings around kitchen and wash area it was horrible. Cockroaches, mice and lots and lots of dust. I understand this place is for online orders but not for dine in given the fact that people dont get to see this unhygienic atmosphere."
Aromas@11SIX,Anuj Jain,16 February 2019,5,Went for a birthday party...it‚Äôs a small restaurant with simple ambiance...food is really good and you must try it once...got to know the story behind the name and its pretty interesting and inspiring...staff is politely and courteous...
Aromas@11SIX,Soumendra Kumar Dash,10 February 2019,1,The prices are hiked and then discount is offered. Basically the discount provided by the restaurant is kind of a fraud and they try to fool people.
Aromas@11SIX,Kiran Raj Biswal,03 February 2019,5,"A beautiful calm place to settle down and have food. Liked the Ambience. Had ordered mutton rogan josh, kadhai paneer, butter nan, hot n sour soup. Must say they have really maintained a great taste for whatever they cook loved all d dishes we had ordered mutton rogan josh was d best till now I had in entire hyderabad kadhai paneer was surely an authentic kadhai paneer with whole spice taste coming from d dish soup was also upto d mark and also liked the behaviour of the staff really well behaved. Will surely revisit the place again."
Aromas@11SIX,Pritam Kumar,03 February 2019,5,"Nice experience overall. We had dinner 2 times and ordered online once, the food was good. Dal makhni was specially very good and the place is very peaceful too."
Aromas@11SIX,Revanth Kasinavesi,20 January 2019,3,"This place started as a great place initially, but in recent times the quality and quantity have been reduced.
One of their best dishes "" Sarson ka phool"" is the best example of this category.
You need to go back to your basics else you will loose the customers slowly"
Aromas@11SIX,Hrish B,20 January 2019,4,"I have been ordering from this place for a long time. They are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via Swiggy or UberEats. The food is as described, there is no overdose of spices or oil. The menu is varied. I have tried Chinese and Tandoori dishes from here, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This is my first choice when we want to dine in. My favourite dishes from here are Chicken Lababdaar, Kafuli and Chicken Afghani.

I took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control, like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt."
Aromas@11SIX,Sharan_pavan43,18 January 2019,3,"This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby."
Aromas@11SIX,Pushkaraj Patil,14 January 2019,5,Great taste and always have been consistent with the quality of the food been served. Zomato Gold members can enjoy 1+1 and its worth it for the price you pay and the quality of food they serve.
Aromas@11SIX,Ranjith Kumar Somisetty,06 January 2019,1,"I have ordered today Veg Cantonese pan fried noodles, both noodles and soup are not at all good. Noodles not cooked well. Soup has too much of corn floor and unable to eat. Total parcel went to garbage tin."
Aromas@11SIX,Swati Tiwari,02 January 2019,4,"Food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. Kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy.

Service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members.

Ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. Ambience is overall very average.

Value for money: Great. It is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served."
Aromas@11SIX,Tanmay Das,29 December 2018,4,"3.5 by me. The food was quite good 4.5/5 for taste. We ordered Paneer Achari Tikka and Paneer Butter Masala, both of which were quite good, nothing to complain about. The butter rotis were a little overcooked but ok. Service was also good. Points deducted for cleanliness as the outside area was infested with fleas so wasn't able to get the dhaba style experience (with benches and lanterns which made the outside experience desirable), the inside seating was good tough."
Aromas@11SIX,Rajender,27 December 2018,3,"Tasty food but expect less quantity compared to price.
It is on the middle of kajaguda to nanakramguda. Not crowded and big. Very small restaurant."
Aromas@11SIX,Krishna Mandovara,19 December 2018,3,"Ambience: Not great, by seeing photos we expected more out of it but it didn't match our expectations. It was dark and sort of out of order too.
Rating : 3/5

Food: We reached here just to have sizzlers as we wanted it and could find only some on the list being this one of them. We took sizzler again it was not what we thought of it was just about fine. Then we ordered panner tikka and something in non veg starters. Starters were good they grilled properly baked properly proper taste. We ordered some curries and naan again the main course was just about fine not great. Overall we only liked starters here.
Rating : 3/5

Service: It was bit slow we had to wait for quite some time for getting our order at one point we thought that maybe they are outsourcing the food also üòÖ
Rating : 3/5

Overall: Place is bit hard to find and food it is not that great it is decent for you to explore. But not the first choice."
Aromas@11SIX,Mithun Ravindranathan,11 December 2018,4,"Review No 514: 
 
In my recent visit to Hyderabad, I was introduced to Aromas@11Six. While the name sounds interesting, but I was not able to find the reason behind their name. 

Our teams in Hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here, I was keen to find out how they fared. 
 
Here's what we ended up ordering over a few days from Aromas@11Six 
 
Gosht Rogan Josh: What a beautiful preparation of spices and meat. The meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation. I usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but Aromas@11Six got it absolutely right with this dish. 
 
Butter Rotis: Even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office, they were warm and soft. Nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold Hyderabad winter evening. 
 
Paneer Butter Masala: The quality of the Paneer used was excellent. The quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate. I loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used.  
 
Dal Fry: Again, in many instances I have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish. Thank you for serving this up well.  

Paneer Biryani: On of the days, I could not have non-veg food and ended up ordering their Paneer Biryani and it was filling to the core. The quality of the rice and preparation was nice. Thank you for not being stingy with the Paneer. 

See if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals. That way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well. 
 
Price: In line with the competition. They have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal. 
 
Service: They have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders (especially during dinner time). 
 
Ambience: We have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral. 

Here‚Äôs the final ratings basis my experience at Aromas@11six. I‚Äôm going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their Menu and I would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future.:

Food: 4/5 
Price: 4/5 
Service: 4/5  
Ambience: 3/5 (Our review has been based only on home delivery and hence keeping this neutral) 
***************** 
Overall: 4/5 (Implied rating of 4 on Zomato)"
Aromas@11SIX,Sharanya.naga77,09 December 2018,1,I wish i had a 0 star option for this.We visited for the first time and it was a very unprofessional way of having food there. The service was although fast but the food was terrible. We ordered apollo fish which was not at all worth eating and the mushroom starter itself gave a unwilligness to eat. The main course we ordered was Murg and Veg Kolhapuri which absolutely had no salt in it. The restaurant couldnt even provide lemons to us even after requesting multiple times whereas they had cut lemons for finger bowl. A must ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to this place.
Aromas@11SIX,Habeeb,09 December 2018,4,"If you‚Äôre bored of these pizza burgers & biryani mandis , I think you should definitely visit this place
Food is really good 4/5
Ambience 3/5
Butt :) you have to wait for a lotttttt of time :(
Other than that everything is good
I would suggest to go with North Indian dishes üôÇ they are really yummy üòã"
Aromas@11SIX,Parth Gupta,02 December 2018,1,The ambiance of this place doesn‚Äôt justify the price. Severely over priced. Only with Gold is it ok. Would prefer if they thought of their service and ambience and try and compare with other restaurants out there.
Aromas@11SIX,Dheeren,02 December 2018,1,"Horrible first time experience. I would never suggest ordering or going to this restaurant. They have absolutely no regards for the customer satisfaction. I ordered food from this restaurant and after first accepting my order they go ahead and decline it after an hour. When I called the restaurant they say that it was the Zomato delivery guy declined it. I called Zomato and they say that the restaurant never responded to their call and so they had to cancel it. I called the delivery guy and he said that the restaurant told him that some one else picked up the order. I am not sure who is at fault here but I had a horrendous experience overall. So, I am not going to order or go to this restaurant again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone for their pathetic customer service."

Aromas@11SIX,Mohit Gupta,25 November 2018,1,I ordered mutton biryani and it was very bad..Worst quality mutton biryani you can eat . The pieces were all leftovers small bits and it felt he gave all leftover . On telling him to replace...reataurant told let them check it ...But then nothing was replaced . One should not prefer this restaurant as quality is now degraded . Extremely bad and horrible service .
Aromas@11SIX,Aruna Kiran,24 November 2018,5,"Its my updated review , first time it was not good experience w.r.t staff but we opted this place again due to good food , they improved alot w.r.t service and staff response , food anyways is great here"
Aromas@11SIX,Krishna Kv,11 November 2018,1,very bad ...I didn't expect this quality and taste...
Aromas@11SIX,Moyeed Faizan,06 November 2018,3,"the food is great but it took almost 45 min to se
rve,ambiance is good, Zomato gold is accepted address is pretty simple. tandoori chicken is very tasty ."
Aromas@11SIX,Mohit Joshi,03 November 2018,1,"Been a regular customer of this place. The quality and taste has gone from wow to very bad. Had the worst biryani recently, tasteless, half of the chicken was uncooked and other half stale."
Aromas@11SIX,Avinash,29 October 2018,5,"Ordered Chicken kolhapuri via swiggy and the experience was top notch . The gravy is to die for.. Spicy, succulent.

This is the best and spiciest chicken kolhapuri I had in last 2 years.

It appears it's slow cooked and boneless chicken is then dipped in the gravy.

The aroma was fantastic and was feeling great having this curry.

I can still feel it in my mouth... Kudos to the chef

Taste 5/5
Quantity 4/5

Will definitely try other curies from this place."
Aromas@11SIX,Shubham Sharma,27 October 2018,4,"Food - Amazing food had chefs special kofta curry with peas pulao, it was the best I had after so long time. It is must try place for food.

Ambiance- okay not great outside sitting is under construction.

Parking - due to road construction it was not good but manageable

Services- very good services and staff is very friendly"

Aromas@11SIX,Karthik Kodumuru,11 October 2018,2,"Were there for my friend's birthday party as the place is nearer to her. It's a small place with around 6-7 tables, with only two stewards. Service is good as the place is not so crowded at the time we went.

Had Manchow Soup which can be much better. Lipta Mushroom isn't that great, mushroom isn't fresh. There's no crispness in the Crispy Corn. Egg biryani is good. Overall not satisfied with the food much. Even pricing is little high, in comparison with the taste and quality."
Aromas@11SIX,Harshitha.guguloth9,10 October 2018,1,I ordered the aroma‚Äôs special chicken biryani and it would have been better if it wasn‚Äôt soo salty..Please do look into this next time......
Aromas@11SIX,Kshiti Dubey,07 October 2018,3,"Starters were good. The main course lacked salt and a bit of lemon juice. We ordered the palak paneer. I've had food here once before and it was amazing then, so this time, it was a slight disappointment. Last time I had the chicken tikka which was really amazing."
Aromas@11SIX,Lakshmi Siddhi,07 October 2018,1,"Totally overrated
Just avoid this place unless you wanna loose your money for a cheap quality food
There's only one guy who does all the service and you have to wait long for your turn to come up
And the place looks like some forbidden house"
Aromas@11SIX,Rupam Saha,30 September 2018,2,"The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.
And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. Frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. But they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. Atlast though they agreed. Overall we weren't satisfied at all."
Aromas@11SIX,Shashwat Priyadarshi,28 September 2018,5,"Best place to eat near my office.
Food is really tasty. The staffs are polite.

The owner himself is very friendly.

The service is a bit slow.
The tandoor items are really nice and their special biryani is really good. The best thing is that it won't cost you much.
Not at all overpriced."
Aromas@11SIX,Abhishek Sharma,26 September 2018,1,I ordered Kadai Veg and Methi malai paratha. Both had a lot of soil particles and we couldn't eat either of them. On my previous experiences I really appreciated the food and highly rated the restaurant for the same dishes that disappointed me this time. We ended up ordering from somewhere else since the restaurant didn't act on my prompt complaint.
Aromas@11SIX,Roshni Aftab,21 September 2018,4,"Nice little place , hard to locate though. This is near to Lanco Hills in Manikonda. The food here is really good and the staff is very attentive. The ambience is not so great but good for small family dining experience. This place had gold and we had ordered one starter, one Biryani and one kulcha. All tasted good. And the bill was around 450 bucks .

Can try it if you want someplace light on budget."
Aromas@11SIX,BOBBY REDDY PALLE,20 September 2018,5,"one of the most underrated restaurants. Some of the dishes are a must try like Gulaabi Chaap.  Reasonable rates.

Aromas@11SIX,Venkatesh Nekkanti,19 September 2018,3,Ordered Schezwan Chicken Via Swiggy Last Night. The Taste is Bland. Neither Good Nor Bad. Just Okay. The Quantity is way Less for a 210 Rupees Dish.

Aromas@11SIX,Ritika Trivedi,09 September 2018,4,"A place one can miss easily because of the location, but a must try.
I would say the ambience could have been better but the food supercedes the ambience.
The broccoli , paneer corn kebab , babycorns ,tandoori chicken ,prawns were amazing.
I would say stuffed paneer tikka and paneer butter masala could be better.
The mutton gravy was pretty good too along with chicken biryani.
Among the chapatis , Malai methi roti was really really nice."
Aromas@11SIX,Seshadri Reddy,04 September 2018,4,"Went to this place just because it's listed on Zomato Gold and I must say I am pretty impressed with the whole experience over there. We have ordered Paneer Majestic nothing extraordinary about it was good. Later we have tried Bhami Goreng, Veg Kolhapuri, Butter Naan and Murg Biryani. Bhami Goreng had very unique different flavour/taste which I liked. Same thing with the curry and naan both of them were really good. Special mention to Murg Biryani it was amazing.

Coming to prices they were pretty reasonable.

Ambience: 3/5

We ordered salt n pepper fries,crispy corn,biryani and chicken salt n pepper is truely delicious."
Aromas@11SIX,Gayatri Tandon,11 August 2018,4,"So I haven't tried most of their dishes but what I've tried is the Chinese cuisine. And I must say its really nice. Do try out their veg fried rice as well chilli chicken dry, or chilli paneer dry. These dishes have been pretty amazing whenever I've been there. So do try ;)

Reason for giving 3* is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends. But, we, non-veg guys were totally disappointed for non-veg curries. It's got no taste at all. Chilli chicken gravy was like saucy-saucy. No spicy at all. Butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be. It tasted like wheat flour and not maida.

Service- Good
Taste- Below average
Ambiance- Good
Cost- High"
Aromas@11SIX,Saisharath Masam,03 August 2018,5,Very tasty biryani
Aromas@11SIX,Bhawani,30 July 2018,1,Very very bad. The food was not of good taste and quality as well. It‚Äôs like throwing money in water. Just some fancy names they have kept for dishes but the standard aren‚Äôt even like for petty shops. In fact after having the food both me and my husband have got food infection. Pls close ur shop instead of making people sick.

Aromas@11SIX,Pallavi Tiwary ( FoodLicks),27 July 2018,5,"Situated a little away from the main road Aromas serves quite good Indian as well as Continental dishes including Chinese and Thai food. The cost of all the dishes are at the lower side as compared to the other restaurants. It has an average interior with both indoor and outdoor sitting. Though the service here is not so good but the food covers it all. I really liked the taste of the north Indian food that it served. It has true north Indian flavour. I loved Gulaabi Chaap which is a betroot kebab. Lehsuni dhaniya murg , Sholay kebab , Malai warki paratha, kastori kebab are the other tasty and aswumm items that I tried. Undoubtedly it comforted my taste and was happily back home .:)"

Aromas@11SIX,Nikita,18 July 2018,4,Went for a North Indian dinner! The place is a little out of way. The ambience is okay. It looked more like a college hang out place. There were only 2 people managing the counter and the tables. However the food was really good. Decent place for lunch or dinner and easy on the pocket as well( especially if you have Zomato Gold)!
Aromas@11SIX,Narsing Rao,16 July 2018,5,Amazing
Aromas@11SIX,Sudha Chittamula,16 July 2018,2,"Ordered Tawa aloo paratha, Veg Manchurian and Badami Kheer. Paratha is below average, veg Manchurian is OK. No badam flavor in kheer, but it's a rice kheer"

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,The Food O‚ÄôClock,23 May 2019,5,"It is at 6th floor of Act Boutique building that the entrance gate is just opposite to Karachi Bakery. The building is little bit inside. Once you get there, u will find a cafe on the ground floor.
The place is cool, not so noisy, spacious and hygiene. Service is fast. They have seating arrangement in two ways, 1) chair and table 2) carpet seating like traditional.

We ordered mutton Haleem and Chicken Fahm Mandi Half for two people. There was no chicken haleem.

The mutton Haleem was delicious. I feel this is the best Haleem I had. Taste- 5/5

The chicken Fahm Mandi was delicious too. The masala was perfect. But people who don‚Äôt like masala may not be pleased much. They give good amount of chicken. Taste-5/5"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Tanzeem Alam,19 May 2019,1,I am new to Hyderabad.. heard of the Hyderabadi Haleem here is very famous so ordered haleem from this restaurant. It was a disastrous experience. Please dont try any kind of haleem here. I haven't tried any other dish here and now I am hesitant to order any other dish from here after having haleem here.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Saif Rahman Khan,05 May 2019,5,"Situated at the heart of the town, this is by far the best place to lay your hands on Arabian and Yemeni dishes in the City of Nawabs. With stiff competition from more than a dozen other restaurants in the area, the prices are average but the Quality is exceptional. The ambience of the place is exceptional and with adequate lights which are extremely soothing to the eyes. Food apart, the whole setup of the restaurant creates a Unique Aura for all food lovers.

Note :- Plz do try the BBQ Chicken Mandi and the Juicy Chicken Mandi. They are the best items from the whole menu.

In frame - BBQ Chicken Mandi & Chicken Juicy Mandi"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nikhil Naik,05 May 2019,5,"I had been here with my office colleagues for lunch. We order malai chicken and mix chicken mandi. I earlier had mandi at different places in Hyderabad but this place was awesome. They had nice interiors with seating arrangements. If you are not comfortable seating on the rug then you can sit on table and chair. For food I would rate it 5+ for amazing taste, quantity and for that Arabian food feel. We order 2 mandi and we all 8 of us were so full and started feeling sleepy. As it was lunch time we had to build some courage and go to office:-)...will be visiting again to try some Mutton mandi."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Lovely Priyanka,01 May 2019,4,"Chicken nuggets must try here....bbq chicken mandi is too gud....but ambience is not too gud...and not so neat...
But itsgud only for taste food..waiting time is too high bettween 8-10"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Biswarup Bose,28 April 2019,1,Have always been a fan of the Shawarma of this place. Therefore wanted to try the mandi as well. But was utterly disappointed with the quality of rice being served. By no means it seemed to be mandi rice. It was more like Pulao rice. Considering the price that I paid the quality was no match for it. Mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was. Kindly look into the image and you will understand.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Manas Gangishetti,28 April 2019,1,I like this place for shawarma but mandi was pathetic. It contained pulao rice. Full sticky no cashews. Really not the kind of mandi i was expecting from this place. Really pathetic Mandi
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,FoodBites,26 April 2019,4,"I came to know this place through my colleague. We went here for a team lunch.
And this place is one of the best ideas to have team lunches. As Mandi is specially a platter for 2 and more people can eat together.
Ambience- normal and okay
Service - fast and good
Food taste - quite good and worthy
Ordered chicken wings mandi and barbeque chicken mandi, chicken is tender and tasty, rice is flavourful and quantity is great.
Veg mandi is okay but not so tasty
Bas bousa -3/5 . I am trying for the 1st time. Taste is great but its quite dry
Overall xperience is great for huge teams"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Anwesha,20 April 2019,5,"We went for my birthday dinner here. There ambience is beautiful to say the least, the stuff is quite courteous. We had chicken Mandi, kebabs, and kaddu ka kheer. Although kaddu ka kheer was a bit too liquid for us, we loved our food. This place isn't really pocket friendly, but totally worth the money."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Hemachand Yadav Gogula,11 April 2019,4,I tried chicken mandi made in arabian there will be badam and Kissmiss garnished on that which is open ur taste buds. Chicken wings and kurbaani ka meeta are also lovely dishes to try when ever you visit that restaurant
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nawaz Mohammed,06 April 2019,4,"We were 2 friends wanted to eat some mandi.. I know some is not the right word when it comes to mandi.. With that huge plate and all.. So yum yum tree is a great place to eat mandi. It was around 2o clock in noon when we visited..the place is very calm and not on main road but its easy to find.
Ambience is spot on arabic, songs played are romantic. The guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he's serving us. Nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too.
We ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish..
Grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it.. She likes fish may be thats why!
BBQ chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad..! Trust me with a lot of mandi places its a tough to be on top 5...Bbq chiken pieces wer juicy and very flavour full...they give you mayonise and chutney to go along! Prices are very pocket friendly...you can visit with family, friends or girlfriend. Its a perfect place for mandi.. Definitely going again!"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Akshay Kumar,06 April 2019,5,A gem and must try Hyderabad restaurant. The ambiance to sit relaxed and enjoy with friends plus the unmatched pleasure of getting high on briyani. I tried the mutton mandi and it was extremely tender and flavourful.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nikhil,01 April 2019,3,"The place gives you a feeling like you are having food at a royal Arab resta, the food here is aptly cooked but the required seasonings are not provided(fried onion which are main in a Mandi) and also I have seen them filling tap water in the bottles and serving the same as bottled water , so watch out at last you can rate the food at 4/5 , seasonings 2/5, ambience 1/5 at last it is a great place to go with family and friends"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Madhusha Urlam,29 March 2019,5,"Perfect Mandi place. Ordered for 2 and had to stuff ourselves for completing the whole plate üòÖ
4-5 ppl and order one and eat upto full
Tasty chicken üòÅüòÅ
Visit with frnds and family üòÄüòÄ"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Siva Kumar,26 March 2019,2,"The most important factor which I take into consideration is- Service.
And if they are rude, don't give any importance to customers, they don't deserve anything.
Giving 2 stars just for the ambience"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Harsh,22 March 2019,4,Mandi is good. Prices are affordable with generous serving. We tried fish Mandi and it was yummy. Only thing they need to fix is furniture as it looks worn out.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Sekharamantri Snigdha,16 March 2019,5,Best place for all mandi fans. Nevwr miss their saalan and miyo and with no forgetting their extra fried onions. It is best for giving treats. Budget friendly parties
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Prasun Gokhlani,12 March 2019,3,"Have been here once. The staff was courteous and very friendly. Overall the theme was perfect and sets the Arabic mood. I think they can work a bit more on offering more choices, felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for. Limited veg options too."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Sriram Jv,10 March 2019,1,Ordered grilled tandoori and to my surprise i have got 2 neck pieces for one chicken...must be an alien!!! Such a pathetic taste of food that i am never going to order from this joint again
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Ashutosh Choudhari,10 March 2019,3,"I just wonder how people praise the food and service.
Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Ujjwal Multani,27 February 2019,4,The place was really a new experience for me ...food was good enough..ambience was good resembling the Arabic theme ..staff was good..one can visit here to experience Arabic style of food..rates are I think above average..
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Adarsh Poddar,17 February 2019,5,This place is absolutely amazing. From the classic Mandi to their other dishes. The food here gives you a taste you can never forget. Tue ambience just adds to the beauty that this place already is. The waiters were very polite and helpful. Loving this place a lil more with every visit.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Anirudh Bhattacharjee,06 February 2019,5,This is a small place on the 6th floor of a hotel. Not a lot of options for veggies. The mandi is brilliant. We were about 10 of us and got a chance to try a lot of starters and they were all good. The flag bearer at this place is the Mandi. You need atleast 5 folks mop it. Service is good and the food is not very heavy on the stomach. Don't miss it
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Sudhansu Mohanty,26 January 2019,4,Awesome food. Been there with my office colleagues for lunch and had ordered half veg thali and falafel. The half plate is enough for 3 people at least. The food was yum suitable for the name and lot of crowd. Would love to visit again.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Satarupa Roy,25 January 2019,2,The place don't have mutton though they have it in menu. Chicken Mandi is ok ..not that great.ambience in contrast is great. Music is too loud to have conservation in lunch.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Ashwin Ramesh,19 January 2019,4,"Had gone out with friends for a midnight craving and had the Mandi, it was served on a huge plate and the seating was so perfect for us to help comfortably finish off the entire dish. The rice was very flavorful and we were able to taste the ghee and cognitive milk in every bite. A great place for a feast!"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Avishek Chakraborty,12 January 2019,3,"The place is a bit isolated but the food and ambience is quite good. Even one of the best place to have the Arabian Mandi. Give a visit for sure, I would say.
Fahm Mandi - less spicy
Barbaque chicken Mandi- If you don't mind having a bit spicy. My personal favourite it is."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Priyanka,10 January 2019,4,"My first mandi dining ever. But as the name says, the food was yumm.

We ordered half special veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi. The mandi is more than enough to fill three people and the cost is reasonable.

The Arabian theme ambience looked warm and inviting. The add on point was the seating arrangement"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'",08 January 2019,4,"This branch is in one of the interior areas in the hitech city.

Ambiance: The ambiance is rich and has good feel and better ambiance compared to the other branches

Food: We had the mixed mandi platter which is like 1k+ but really huge with good variety of chicken grill, tandoori, mutton, french fries, etc.
The rice is also fine and is accompanied by good amount of fried onion and cashew nuts and other sides like mayo and tomato chutney.

We also had the teriyaki burger which was not upto the mark of the long lost taste of the original yum yum tree.

Overall:

Ambience 9/10
Food : 8.5/10
Value for money: 9/10"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),02 January 2019,3,"Arabic feel-
Ambiance-
Yum yum tree is one of the best restaurants in Hyderabad specialised in Arabic Mandi. Yum yum tree has one of it's outlet at Gowlidoddy, exactly above Art Botique hotel. Yum yum tree has one of the finest ambiance in Gachibowli area. Indoor as well as outdoor sitting is available. Live sports screening is available at the terrace.
Food-
Yum yum tree is famous for it's Arabic Mandi, they also serve various kinds of starters and shawarmas. We placed an order for Chicken Stick Mandi and Chicken Barbeque Mandi. Chicken stick Mandi has 6-7 boneless chicken pieces, which were tasted perfectly with Mandi rice. Half Chicken barbeque Mandi included 2 large barbeque chicken pieces served with 2 types of gravies.
Service -
Service at Yum Yum Tree Gachibowli is average, as they take more time to serve starters."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Amatullah (Lifeofafoody),30 December 2018,5,"The only branch which I liked though it's quite far.It has a rooftop too which is beautiful and opens after 6 or 7.Serves delicious food in a reasonable price,staff was very friendly. They only serve 2 desserts and sadly khunafa isn't one of them. We had baklava which wasn't that good.It would be great if they expand their menu a little more.
Ambience -5/5
Food-4/5
Staff-5/5
Service-5/5"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Neetika Sahai,30 December 2018,5,"Once, we have ordered chicken special cheese shawarma from this restaurant and it was very yummy. So, today out of the blue me and my husband thought of trying their mandi also. We have already heard a lot about mandi in their restaurant.. We went for lunch and there was waiting. We waited for 15mins to get Arabian seat. After having mandi I can only say one thing, try at once. But keep in mind its a good place for non-vegeterians.."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Waseem Syed,21 December 2018,5,"Good place to spend a weekend... It's a beautiful place with delicious food..
Liked the hospitality of the staff
Recommend every one to visit at least once"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Shyam Kumar,09 December 2018,5,It's too good for sitting and the dessert was awesome. And it's good time for family to have anice time. And the staff is polite and good. The environment is pleas # itsyummy
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Pavan Rishit Meka,03 December 2018,4,"As the name says: If you want to checkout the yummy Arabian food in Hyderabad, then this your place.

The ambience is very spacious and resembles the Arabic style of interior decor and seating. This also has camel prototype placed in the entrance.

If you're a hater of sea food, you will start loving it after eating the Grill Fish Tikka from here.

Food we tried here:

Chicken BBQ Tikka
Grill Fish Tikka
Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi

All the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it's kind. Chicken BBQ Tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that I have tried before. Grill Fish Tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones. It just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best.

Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi comes with Arabian Mix Grill Platter. It's comes with a combination of Chicken Tikka, chicken wings, Grill Fish Tikka, Chicken BBQ Tikka and Mutton.

This was the best Mandi I ever had. It has rice cooked in Arabian style with Kaju, kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice. This combination of rice with grilled non-veg Tikka gives you a foodgasm. And also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you're on a very high appetite.

Service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items. So if you're planning to try Arabian food in this city of Nizam, then do try this place."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,G Sneha,29 November 2018,5,"Tasty food.. Mandi and deserts.. Both veg and non veg
Everyone can hop on wd family n friends.. And parcel options also available.. Goo(ddddddddddddddddd"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Yashwanth Kotha,23 November 2018,2,The food quality has gone down compared to its initial opening period. The rice is too bland and the chicken dishes are a bad excuse for being a lazy chef.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,SONIYA SINHA,16 November 2018,3,"Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The d√©cor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Dileep Deepu,12 November 2018,3,"Visited with my friend in weekend and it's my 1st visit to this food court... firstly Ambience was impressive so that I had started taking selfies.. coming to Service just OK
And food taste was not up to the mark .."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Vinutha Devendran,12 November 2018,2,"Very disappointed with the food that I ordered from Yum Yum Tree today. The quantity of the rice for the juicy mutton Marag was less (I ordered full) and there were only bones in the mutton, no flesh at all. Felt cheated for the money I paid. Shawarma was good. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll try the food from here once again."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Som Patil,08 November 2018,3,"This was my first visit to Yum Yum Tree restaurant, and food was ok. We were three people and ordered Sheesh Tawook starter & Chicken BBQ Mandi, overall good experience.

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Astonishedflame7,30 October 2018,5,The best yum yum tree branch till date. The chicken zinger burger is a must try. A rooftop restaurant makes it best to hangout . The ambience is great.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Shazia Khan,26 October 2018,5,Excellent! thank youüòä
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Joe Mathew,23 October 2018,4,This branch of  Yum Yum Tree is on the Gowlidoddi road a little further from the Q city building. This place is known for the Mandi they serve but I thought of trying something other than Mandi and so I  ordered the chicken jumbo burger which had a generous amount of chicken and mayonnaise. The burger tasted good and it was quite filling. This place isn't harsh on your pocket.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Annamravindrababu,21 October 2018,5,Wonderful food and ambiance. Best place for a family ! The food is exotic. The staff courteous. Value for money. My family had a very good time.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Asma Sharia| Phenomenal.everyday,20 October 2018,5,"Visited Yum Yum tree with my family for dinner. I wanted to try Mandi since so long and the long wait ended here. This Arabian food joint is located in Financial District, Gachibowli in a gated community with ample of parking space. The interiors are great and food is to the point as the name suggests - Yum Yum. Both the quality & quantity you get is amazing for a decent price. Also, the staff is highly courteous and hospitable.

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Siddardha Reddy,19 October 2018,4,Love the shawarmas....Turkish special shawarmas is the best. Order is quick. Tried mutton fried Mandi...not worth the hype. Food quality is to the point.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Visveswara Balu,11 October 2018,2,"The outlet looks good. The service is excellent. Food is fine. Its not true to its cuisine.. its not true Arabic food.. shawarma is not what you expect.. it's more like a roll. If you want a true authentic Arabian food, i suggest you to go to some other place."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nikita Bhojwani,10 October 2018,4,"As the name, so is the food.
The food is really yum. As mandi is the most popular food, we tried two options.

Special Veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi.

Both were extremely delicious and mouth melting.

Especially the aloo tikki slices on the veg one gave an amazing crunch.

The service is decent and staff is super supportive.

Cheers. A must try."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Sai Parithosh,08 October 2018,5,"The best mandi I ever had till date... The flavours, the richness in taste was amazing, had chicken bbq mandi.. they also serve burgers and taste one.. the mayo was very sweet which many people would not like it."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Madhav Pachikori,30 September 2018,4,Best mandi I have ever had. Well served food. Good cooking that it feels very light even if you eat a whole medium mandi. Ambiance is not bad.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Dhamma Prakash Bhagath,26 September 2018,2,Food is cold.. N not even tasty
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Furkhan Shareef,22 September 2018,5,"Awesome Arabian food joint ... your search for Mandi should end here for good. Calm and serene place on the 6th floor, has ample parking space as it is within gated community. Went out for family dinner menu is not huge but has something to satisfy everyone‚Äôs taste buds provided you are a non vegetarian. For starters tried the fish grill and Lebanese juicy chicken. It was one of the best fish dishes I‚Äôve tasted in town, I‚Äôm particular about my fish, not much bones or fins, should not
Smell bad and should be cooked well, all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect. High standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for Lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. So a 5 on 5 for starters. Now moving to the the attraction of the day, the Mandi it was authentic Middle East preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton Mandi, mutton quality was above par, Mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, Mandi is not for you. Ended the day with baklawa which was usual.
Recommend must try place for Mandi"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Amit Jagdale,21 September 2018,2,"Not worth the hype created, the service is not worth the cost. Many dishes from the menu was not available saying we're not serving Indian food. When ordered cold drink they gave 500ml bottle and paper cup, for a restaurant of this level you expect proper glasses for drinks. The taste was okay but the rice quality was not what i get in paradise or other biryani place.
My first Mandi experience in Hyderabad was not good."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Solmon Chris,20 September 2018,4,"Food is delicious. Chicken BBQ mandi, Mutton Fry Mandi and Chicken Burger are awesome... Good Ambiance and service...
Owner and Staff are courteous"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Gautham Maheswaran,17 September 2018,3,"Arabian touch to a sumptuous feast! A great place for team outings and the Mandis will make your team work totally worth it. Good taste in food and great ambience. Service could be improved a notch. The Mandis will fill up to 3 people and is worth the penny. Courteous staff and great seating arrangement. Best visited in the night. 

P.S. Don't get flabbergasted by the looks of the Mandi

Personal favourites: Chicken BBQ Mandi, Mutton Juicy Mandi. Fairly good shawarmas (sp. chicken cheese shawarma)"
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Prince Tariq,01 September 2018,4,Mixed Mandi....So far the best one I had.... ideal for 4 to 6 people who r foodies....ambience too gud....service neee to be improved. Seating good enough. Loved it. Try for the parties with ur friends.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Venu Gopal Allumalla,21 August 2018,1,They didn't provide any ketchup nor tissues also with the order. Ordered chicken cheese shawarma which is not tasty and the fries provided are not fresh but very soft.
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Mukherjee,18 August 2018,2,"Went on a sat noon. Food is ok type, not that tasty, mayonese is sweet (-_-| wtf ????) , mutton is not tasty. Chicken starter was crispy ( reason for 2 *) . I didn't like the desert also.

Verdict : Not recommend, skip."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Teja Dandigunta,18 August 2018,4,"The best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement, very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friends/family.
We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.

People go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. Five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
Their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.
Overall this is a must visit to have mandi."
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Mixxtures_TastyTwist,16 August 2018,3,"This is an Arabian themed Restaurant and is located near QCity, Gachibowli and is exclusively known for its MANDI. üçõüçö

They have different varieties of Mandi and the restro is designed very well with eye catching Ambience.üê™üê´üê™üê´

Taste is quite different from other places of Hyderabad where we enjoy Biryani. But yes, The Biryani tasted equally good.üòäüòäüòä

For my surprise Veg Biryani is served with French Fries and some patties which tasted good as well.

Food -4/5
Ambience - 5/5
Value for money - 3.5/5
Service -4/5

Thank you for a different experience..!!

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Gaurav Lall,30 July 2018,2,"Honestly, I've been to this place couple of times in frequent events. 1st two times I really loved the Mandi, but last two times it was just ok ok. Have you guys sacrificed your quality or it was the odd timing both the time I went?? I feel the taste should be same all the time. Specially the rice in the mandi use to be tastier than chicken or mutton but now its just ok ok type. Dont do this guys, you have one of the best for Mandis in Hyderabad please maintain your quality."

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Asraahmad22,25 July 2018,4,"Mandi rice had a nice flavour to it, although having tasted the Mandi in Arab countries too I feel that it could have been a bit softer. The chicken was spicy and more Indianised.
Lebanese grill was good."

Loved the mutton mandi which is served with marag soup and other two gravies, mutton was soft, tender and juicy and bbq chicken was perfectly marinated and grilled.Staff needs an improvement on their service.Manager was kind enough to give us corporate discount when asked.Overall good taste of food and good place with nice relaxed ambience of arabian restaurant within that area."

The Tilt Bar Republic,Payel Biswas,19 May 2019,4,"Food is amazing though the space is a constraint here.
But the ambience, look and feel and the food service is amazing.
Food: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Music: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5

Overall, if not for anything for your tastebuds and boozing satisfaction you must hit the floor."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Aparna Singireddy,15 May 2019,4,We went there early evening. It was calm and peaceful. Music was soft. Food was good but the main course quantity was less. Beer tasted well. Service was fast and professional . Recommend for quick dinners.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sravani Bodanapu,09 May 2019,4,"Was here for a club party.

So, This place has an amazing ambience with dim Lighting, well equipped furniture & a large LCD screen & the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match.

Well, Coming to food, I opted for a Veg buffet. The starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.

We had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, Raspberry tasted the best.

Deserts weren't that great. Vanilla scoops were just fine.

Overall, It seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (Yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).

Either ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.

I would rate:

Taste: 3.2/5 (veg buffet)
Ambience: 4/5
Value for money: 3/5"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sri Harsha Konuru,03 May 2019,5,"I always go this place with my friends, wen Eva I get time...There collection of beers is just amazing...Ambience is really good with a nice view...If u stay near Gachibowli, I highly recommend this place..."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,3,"Just make sure why you are going there. If food it would be a 3 rating(yes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though) and if it drinks it would hang near 4. Their varieties in drinks get that for them.
Place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden. You can enjoy the game days well than other days
And yes a good value for your money"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Prateek Jumrani,30 April 2019,5,"I‚Äôm a musician and I perform at this place because the place has a positive vibe! Peaceful atmosphere.
The most important thing, the staff is way more humble and down to earth. They greet you with a smile which is more than enough for people who are stepping in.

Bohot hi khoobsurat jagah.
Esi Jagah, jahan aap sukoon se beth sakte hain apne dosto aur family ke sath!

FOOD : 1) Must try! Chicken white sauce pasta. Isse behtar pasta maine kahin nahi Khaaya! :)

2) Must try all the brews! Very different and unique in taste. Beers which are imported from various countries .

3) For a starter with your drinks, do order fried idli and crispy corn!

Thank you ."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Dinesh Naidu,28 April 2019,4,"Looking for a cool bar close to work, this is the place, went during the IPL season with big screen streaming it live, they have nice collection of beers to try out.

Overall : 4/5
Food :3.5/5
Ambience :4/5"
The Tilt Bar Republic,FitFoodFad,28 April 2019,3,The place was pretty crowded for a weekday. We ordered a couple of chicken items. I only remember the food to be extra spicy. The brews of this place are good though
The Tilt Bar Republic,Prateek Manthapurwar,27 April 2019,5,The food is really good in comparison to other pubs or bars. They have an assortment of foreign drinks some of which are really nice. The ambience is pleasing but the metal table and the chairs might cause a slight discomfort to some.
The Tilt Bar Republic,RM,16 April 2019,4,Quite expensive to be fair. Good ambiance and great beer collection but go only if you've robbed a bank otherwise your wallet will have a major dent.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sarika,15 April 2019,4,"We went during lunch time. It's a good place.
Drinks are nice.
They have offers for lunch too.
The seating is nice. Booking a table is better when going for lunch because it's crowded usually"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Aditya Jhalani,14 April 2019,5,"Been here a couple times now. Great service. Nice food. Not terribly expensive. The ambience is okay-ish. Gold works here, so that's good. Would definitely go again. I only wish they were open for longer. :)"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sharanya.naga77,12 April 2019,1,Its a big mistake if ever u plan to have your food here. We have ordered for Veg Pasta & we have been served with Chicken Pasta. We have waited for an hour just for Broccoli and left without having our food.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Rohit Sunkari,11 April 2019,4,"Such a great ambience it has. Food is damn tasty. Service can be actually improved, choice of drinks and food are really less. Would recommend it for food it has."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Kiran Raj Biswal,09 April 2019,4,Nice place with good ambience and good staff. Tried 2 beer both were good mocktail and cocktail were good. Noodles and chicken hongkong was tasty the only flaw for which I give a 4 star is lack of Indian main course dishes in the menu..
The Tilt Bar Republic,Saket Jain,07 April 2019,2,"Ordered for a Red Sauce Pasta which came sweet. Then ordered for a veg assorted pizza expecting of a better experience but failed there too. It was too bland and nowhere near to a decent pizza too.
There was a band performing too but was so boring that we hardly listened to any of its songs."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Puja Agarwal,07 April 2019,5,"Nice ambience. We went on a live music night by Band Qurbat. They were amazing.

Staff was courteous. Service was good as well.

Now coming to food.
We ordered pasta in cheese sauce, which was fairly cooked. The taste was satisfying.
Also, Tropical punch, and I am fan of all the fruits they prepare it with, hence I liked it.üòç"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Suparn Kuer,06 April 2019,4,"Today we went to this place for office party. The place seems to be strategically located near bio-diversity signal in order to cater crowd from near-by tech parks.

The place is little small and can accommodate maximum of 50-60 people during full house.

They have their own brewery with many variants in beer. The food quality is very good for both veg and non-veg options."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sushmithagali14,05 April 2019,5,"Visited this place for dinner.Soothing music and awesome ambience. The pasta üçù, non-veg platter were so good and also the Mocktails were good."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Mehek Bassi,04 April 2019,5,"Amazing atmosphere and beautifully designed bar! Enjoyed the IPL match while sipping on their different styled mocktail. Their mocktail called Salty Dog is worth trying if you're a fan of salted and spicy drinks! Even better if you can try peach mocktail, infused with tangy flavour and buzz of soda. Overall a great experience!"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Saikrishna Pothuri,02 April 2019,1,The ambience was good. The service was way too slow and the staff was busy watching the cricket match on TV I guess. The food was below average. One of the server didn't inform what we have ordered for pepper chicken and later the person who took the order in the starting came and he was telling that we did not order after 15 minutes of telling the other server. Such a poor coordination and very slow service. Not at all worth the price.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Ashish Jaiswal,27 March 2019,4,"I really enjoyed the cilantro fish and Pasta, everything else was just ok. Limited variety of food. Non-veg main course items didn't meet expectations. Veg main course item tasted good. Overall a good experience"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Siva Kumar,26 March 2019,3,"Food-(3.5/5) There are very limited items to order, especially in main course, there was only butter chicken. The mocktails were also just okay.

Service-(4/5) They were good, they knew their job well.

Ambience-(3.5/5) It was good, could have been more eye catchy, but it was okay. The singer sang very good songs, had the mood up"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Praveen Singh,21 March 2019,4,"Pretty decent place with good food. Very limited options in liquor, they have only 4-5 variants in scotch whiskey. Overall ambience was great."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Gagz Kaur,20 March 2019,2,The food is average. But the service is very very poor. Buffet lunch was not that great. Food was cold when we started our lunch. Raita was watery. Starters are bearable. But the restaurant really needs to pay attention to the service criteria.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Reshma Baratam,16 March 2019,3,"Straight to the point, the food is really good. I‚Äôve been there around 10 o‚Äô clock in the night, maybe because of that the food which was served was cold and that pretty much disappointed me! :|
Anyways, this is a nice place to hangout with friends or family. It has a big screen of a match going on with light music and serves wine too."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Rahul Agarwal,16 March 2019,3,"My exp with the place was a bit different from many other reviews. Went for a lunch with wifey. The place seemed more suitable for groups, college kids and so on.
The food was decent though. Not much to complain about. Service was satisfactory, while waiters were prompt, it wasn't a refined experience.
Overall, I would like to give 3.5/5,but unfortunately can't on the slider scale.
Food - 4/5
Service 3.5/5
Decor/ambirnce - 3/5"
The Tilt Bar Republic,W TF,15 March 2019,3,"Only 3 stars for taste of food. So visited here with colleagues for lunch.
Have expected a good ambeince but too crowded and service was at its lowest,
Might be only cause of Friday.
But Food was good.
And Little conjested place."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Prashant Bahuguna,11 March 2019,5,"If you want to see some different bar menu, this is the place to be. They have Belgian Beers which just perfection along with some unique liquors. I had a pineapple martini, as recommended by the waiter, and that was the best martini I had till date. Food is also good and service is quick. Must visit place."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Kamaal Ahmed (zaiqebaaz),28 February 2019,4,"Tilt is one of the most popular places around Gachibowli for team lunches and chill out evenings. The ambiance is quirky and funky that would appeal to youngsters. Theres live music, sports screening. The window gives a n amazing view of the hitec city traffic.

We started with a mango mocktail called Mango Festival which was the best mango drink I've tasted.

Cajun spiceed Chicken was heavy on cajun spice and did not taste anything else.

Cheese Broccoli was an amazing dish. Both cheese a d Broccoli were fresh and were perfectly cooked.

The Cilantro Fish was another great starter where in meaty Basa chunks were marinated with coriander leaves a d cooked to perfection. No fish smell....that's it. It's a hit!

They have some interesting items on the menu that one wouldn't expect at a place like this.

Ghee fried idli was a surprise and was amazing! Highly aromatic d spicy idli pieces that just fill your mouth with flavours.

Peanut salad. Similar to roadside peanut chat that we get, in a fine dine form. The quantity is great and you just cant stop eating it.

In the main course, I ordered Lamb Chops. The chops were big and meaty but they could have been cooked better.

The grilled fish with rice was again an amazing dish with fresh grilled fish a d flavourful rice.

In the desserts, Cheesecake didn't impress me. They should start baking it.

However the choco lava was a stunner. Probably the best choco lava in the city.

Overall a place with great food but ambiance could have been better."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Siddhardh Stunning,26 February 2019,2,"The food and ambience are average . In starters egg fish and chicken are sort of better . Corn and all other veg ingredients are not up to what you expect it to be and moreover the main coarse is the worst to have . The desserts are decent and the fruits are the best .
I would not recommend a buffet here because the money you spent here goes down the drain think before you go. The moctails they serves was the worst ."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Rashmi (Foodieshots_Hyd),26 February 2019,5,"**** Follow us on Instagram at @foodieshots_hyd ****

TILT European Bar is a unique bar in Hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. While the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, TILT fills in the vacuum. It was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the Trappist monks. Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

We tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper. Of these we liked the Dubbel, La Trappe Witte and the Erdinger Dunkel. They also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were Mint Mango and After Glow.

Their food menu compliments the beers very well. In appetizers we liked the Cajun Spice Grilled Chicken, Zesty Chicken Wings, Cilantro Grilled Fish, Cheese Broccoli and guess what, Spicy Fried Idly ! We were not expecting Spicy Fried Idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. We loved the Chicken Wings, they were at their juiciest best.

In the main course, we were served Grilled Fish with veggies and Lamb Chops with Rice & French fries, both the mains were great. In desserts, we had the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Choco Lava cake. While the Cheese Cake failed to impress us, the Choco Lava cake was finger licking good !

We ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of Smeets Waffle Jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of Belgian waffles, a must try !

Overall TILT European Bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sanjaya Behera,17 February 2019,5,This place is recommended by my friends.so we visited last night.really very good place with a beautiful ambience and a large options of food and beverage variety.i specially like the way of presentation of there food and drinks.a must try place with my recommendation..
The Tilt Bar Republic,Dipanjan Maji,17 February 2019,5,"Great place overlooking bio diversity park junction.very Beauty Full ambience with a prompt service.. great variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks with wonderful taste.
Specially recommend..
Achari paneer.
Fried idili nachos.
Overall a must try place with great offers."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Bharadwaja Ghali,14 February 2019,3,"A chick place.

Went for a team lunch. Service was very good with staff being courteous and prompt in serving food.

We opted for buffet which has decent number of options for both Vegetarian and Non-vegeterians.

An ideal place to hangout with friends on a game night enjoying the drinks and food."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Nupur Saxena,14 February 2019,3,I really don't like the place much . The prices were too high . Small area . Just don't like that much. The music was not upto the mark . And the place was dull
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sejal Modi,13 February 2019,5,"Hands down the best Beer in Town üç∫love their cherry beer.
Ghee podi idly, butter garlic mushrooms, noodles are my favorite appetizers here !!"
The Tilt Bar Republic,PRIYANKA NANDA,10 February 2019,1,"The place is good but not for non drinkers. They are not willing to pay any attention towards non drinkers. Almost all staff members are concentrated at drinkers table only. In short, not a good place for non drinkers."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Srinivas Rao,10 February 2019,5,Food taste is good. Customer service also good. Ambience and music also nice. Cool place to hangout with friends. Overall it's very good.we enjoyed.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Deep Verma,09 February 2019,4,"Food was good but they need to look into quantity which they serve. Quantity was quiet less.
Mango Mint cream is the must try drink of this restaurant."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Shreya Matangi,08 February 2019,4,"Been here with my buddies, meeting after few months...!

Place and ambience is too good...!!!
I would love to hangout there again... probably with the same bunch of buddies again..!!

Service is good too. This place mentions the % of alcohol content for every drink. Anyone who wants to try to have alcohol for the first time this place is of course a good start of it.

I would recommend non vegetarians to go to this place because I don't find veg tasty here..! But thankfully I am a pure non vegetarian..!!"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Arjun,13 January 2019,4,"I went there last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience. The place is on the second floor and you can view the traffic near the Biodiversity Park junction. It's not very crowded either and thus you're able to get a good amount of attention from the staff. They are courteous and efficient and if not sure they do check and come back with the right response.

They have a good variety of Tap Beers. We initially tasted the Chambourlette, La Trappe Witte, Schuimzuiper and Erdinger Weisbier. Chambourlette is very mild, slightly fruity too, La Trappe Witte was smooth, hada flavour of some good fresh spices and no bitter after taste, Schuimzuiper was a little bitter and Erdinger Weisbier was very mild. The obvious choice for us was La Trappe Witte.

For food, we ordered Nachos, Chicken Wings and Schezwan Paneer. Nachos was okay, basically it lacked topping. It looked as if the cheese was applied using a brush and the toppings were more like a garnish. Schezwan Paneer was amazing, the Paneer too had actually soaked the taste of the spices and was wonderful. For main course we ordered Veg Hakka Noodles, which was again prepared well and the noodles too were quite light.

The ambiance of this place is okay, the music is at the right volume and doesn't make you yell to talk. The place however is very dimly lit that your eyes strain while reading the menu as well. But overall a fairly good place to hangout with friends and quench your thirst."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Jay Mehta,13 January 2019,4,Late review. Been there once for dinner and deinks. Nice small place good vibe! Cocktails were made well . No issue with gold! Did go to frio later for desserts
The Tilt Bar Republic,Rahul Reddy,10 January 2019,4,"The best place to chill out with friends , A best place to enjoy the food and alcohol . The staff also good at serving . Best place to hangout..."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Shubham Shrivastava,09 January 2019,5,Best imported beers in Hyderabad.. Such an amazing place for a drinks and food.. A must visit for people who droll for belgium and German beers..
The Tilt Bar Republic,Harsha Jonnala,07 January 2019,4,"The food and drinks are really good , so is the service
But the place lacks the aura to drive you repeatedly
It‚Äôs too mundane to be a weekend place"

Went here on a Saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint.

The place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the Biodiversity park signal, not crowded when we went there. We got ourselves into a table with good view of the city.

We tried Weissbeer and Mango Tango mocktail. The beer was a wheat beer, which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good way.Mocktail was pulpy and sweet. Overall Drinks were üëç

To go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. The chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. The cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. Overall Food was good.

The service was quick and prompt(maybe due to less crowd when we went) and no issues there.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a casual drinks night with friends or family."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Shafia Shams,05 January 2019,4,"Visited this place for a weekday lunch buffet.
Ambiance is really good and even the variety of food offered is good for the price range. 
Both veg and non veg starters were nice and in main course would specially mention the mutton biryani. Apart from this there is live counter for pasta which is pretty good as well.
Dessert section is decent but the molten lava cake with ice cream was amazing. It was served piping hot and really ended the meal on a delicious note."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Chamanthula,05 January 2019,5,It's another good spot which I frequent with friends. Great selection of craft beers love the taste. The staff are always extremely friendly and give good suggestions. Often go here to wind down the day with a pitcher of beer.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Shreyoshi Mandal,04 January 2019,3,"Landed in this small bar for new year lunch buffet. They had limited items in their spread but each of them were super yummy. Nothing to complain about as this costed us merely 400bucks per head.
For drinks, I would totally recommend Project 51 cocktail (A must try!)
The only downside was service. The waiters were friendly but extremely idle and we had a waiting period of atleast 10mins between the serves. Many of the items were only served after repeated calls."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Vysakh Krishnakumar,01 January 2019,1,"This is not a place to express hate but today I went their for a lunch it was a downer
We got the empty buffet counters and plates pasta counter is closed too early and all I felt shame in front of my guest poor guest management and service even you can see in photo my plate was empty even after the beer came on the table i never prefer for a party over their but sugeest you its a nice place to have beer and have some snacks as a bar siting on the bar counter, the beer over their was awesome give only mark for the beer................."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Tanvi,28 December 2018,5,"Great place, all the food I've tried is great. They serve great shrimp and pizza. Ambiance is also really nice. Fun place to go with friends"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Ansh Gupta,28 December 2018,4,"I‚Äôve been to this place four times before and each time the service is excellent,the food is delicious and drinks are the best. The beers here are authentic!"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Tanvi S,28 December 2018,5,"Been here around five times and have had a great experience each time. The owner and the staff are very friendly. Food is great quality, I loved the nachos and pasta the most. The desserts are also very delicious, the choco lava cake is life changing. Only have good things to say about the restaurant. The wide range of mocktails was also great. Would 100% go again and recommend to anyone searching for a fun place to eat and hangout"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sneha Reddy,28 December 2018,4,"Love everything about this place. Food, drinks, ambience and service.
We had water chestnuts, cheese broccoli and nachos in starters. Pizza was good too. A good place to hangout with friends."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Satya Koruprolu,24 December 2018,1,"We found insect in the beer, we informed to the management but the way of their behaviour is worst. This is not good and bad experience in this bar."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Nagaraju,24 December 2018,1,"Worst quality, we found spider at glass of beer and we informed to them but there was no response from their side. It's very bad experience with this bar"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Simha Krishnamurthy,24 December 2018,1,"We found ""Dead Spider"" in Beer mug which was disgusting. The folks from hotel claimed that it fell from roof or from A/C duct , which is not possible as we (four of us) could have not missed a Spider landing into a Beer .
Even going by what Hotel folks told that Spider landed from roof or air conditioning duct its a matter of Hygiene which is missing  . (On a lighter note the person who was drinking from the glass has not got any spider man capabilities) ."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Calming Storm,20 December 2018,3,"Catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. As this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. The spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. Pricing is also decent."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Suresh Neralla,13 December 2018,4,"Great place overlooking Bio diversity park junction to unwind after a hectic work day.

Parking is valet's headache.

Ambiance is quite contemporary & cozy.
Music is loud & heavy.

Great verities of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks with wonderful taste.

Veg Starters:
Fried idli, Nachos - outstanding
Grilled veggies, Garlic bread - very good
Achari paneer - good can be little more softer & burnt at corners

Main course:
Mixed veg curry & butter nan are simply awesome

Dessert:
Chacolava with ice cream - okeish

Pricing - little bit higher for the quantity, however quality is top notch.

Service - when crowd is less very fast & vice versa!

Must try place, check for great offers before ordering."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Ammar Shareef(TasteHyderabad),06 December 2018,3,"They claim to be a European bar who serves continental cuisine.
Went here with my pals.
We ordered Peri
- Peri Chicken pizza and Assorted Pizza.

Service: The waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well.
The service wasn‚Äôt the quickest with around 6-8 people in the house.
Good parking available here.

Food: The pizzas were pretty mediocre. I liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount. We asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff.
Peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging.
The pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn‚Äôt really specially.
My friends ordered pastas and wings.
Wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn‚Äôt too good.

Ambience: It has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music üéµ. Really liked the ambience and the decor as well. The tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look.

Worth a shot with Zomato Gold

Final Verdict:
Food: 3/5
Ambience: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Hygiene: 4/5"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sahu Santosh,02 December 2018,4,We ordered some fish fry it was good . Zesty chicken wings were good . Crispy corn was tasty . And I don't remember the name of chicken item but it was the best
The Tilt Bar Republic,Balaji Chaitanya,30 November 2018,4,Nice view of busy junction of Gachibowli. This place is for the people who are looking for an wonderful brewery!! Also a nice place to Hangout üëç
The Tilt Bar Republic,Riz & Shanky,29 November 2018,3,"Visited this place for an office party that was organised. Pretty good place considering very compact space and seating. The smoking area is way too small.

The food is not that great but quite delicious , nothing I can come.plain off, egg munchuria was standout off all the dishes we ordered.

Overall a one-time visit place , lacks repeat value just because it is way too small"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Vikas Jagetiya,27 November 2018,4,"Nice place for non drinker.
Had order broccoli starter, taste was good.
Order couple of veg curries, taste was good

Surprisingly they did server any dal"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Akanksha,24 November 2018,4,"@Foodiee_globetrotter
Perfect place for Belgian Beer!!
I visited this place for Sunday Drunch(as they say it.. Breakfast+lunch+drinks).
It costs for Rs1000 per person inclusive of taxes which includes welcome drink, soup, starters, main course, dessert and 2 tap beer of your choice.
I loved their hospitality.. For welcome drink they asked our choice and prepared it fresh.

In soup they had Hot and sour which was yummy.

In starters they provided 6-7 differnt varieties which included crispy corn, paneer tikka, garlic bread etc.

Coming to the main course they had limited menu with Dal Fry, Dal Makhani, Mix veg, Paneer korma, Naan, chapati, curd, fryums and 3 kinds of salad.

They also cooked white sause paste just for us!!

In Desserts, they had walnut cake, cutfruits, gulab jamun, shahi tukda, icecream and chocolava cake.

Drinks we asked for was Belgian Kriek, Erdinger dunkel and Schzuimzuiper.

Desserts were kind of okay.. so my suggestion is to make them better.. Because it is the last part of the meal so everyone wants it perfect."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Kamal Sardiwal,20 November 2018,5,"TILT BAR or EUROPEAN BAR? 

I was surprised to hear of Belgian beers being served in here. They are served nowhere else across India.

From Bitter to Spicy Sweet, the options in imported beers are available in heaps. La Trappe Trappist is one of the most recommended beers in here endured through 600 years old history of Monks brewing it.

For those who like it sweet, you should try Belgian Kriek. Taste is perfectly balanced with rich sweetness giving it a fresh finish without the bitter aftertaste.

No beer belly!

Beer hunters, this is the right place to rejoice if you are after some exotic beer.

Must try bottle beers!
1. La Trappe Isod'or
2. La Trappe Triple
3. Green Killer
4. Silly Saison
5. Barbar Blond

I'll let you in a little secret - ASK FOR THE DESSERT OF DRINKS (Smeets Waffle Jenever Shot) AND DON'T YOU MISS!

Mocktail:

After glow - An amalgamation of fresh fruits mixed with mint and topped with litchi grape juices.

Starters I'd recommend:

Chicken Wings, Stuffed mushrooms and Cheese broccoli

Mains:

Honey glazed lamb chops served with fries and rice. The rice flavour should be enhanced with an increase in quantity. 

Desserts:

Blueberry cheesecake. It stands out from the rest I have had at other places.

The staff is amicable and polite. Swift service provided.

Live music available as well. Music system needs to be improved as the audio quality of vocalist sounds completely distorted.

The Tilt Bar Republic,FoodDelicaciesHyderabad,18 November 2018,5,"Hats Off to Tilt Republic Bar- The only Europeon Bar in Hyderabad for having such huge array of Beers from different parts of the World.

The Food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.

When I say Food is good- in elaboration I mean from starters to main course to desserts everything is oh - so Delicious!

The liquor section Of Tilt is hands down the most rare one, I say this cause of the beers they offer. I am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing I've had before.

The beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

The Tilt Bar Republic,Rahul Dronam,17 November 2018,5,"Man I unabashedly love Tilt. It's a unique spot amongst all the bars in Hyderabad. What sets it apart is both the beer and the service. Order the egg Manchuria without fail. The cooks are so good at making it now that you won't find a better version anywhere else in town.

The food tends to be on the spicier side, so if you don't want that do remember to tell you waiter during your order if you prefer it otherwise. This even applies to the pastas and pizzas."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Tornadointhekitchen,15 November 2018,5,"Lovely European Bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (No exaggeration)

Most of the drinks they have are imported from Europe and are supposedly not found any where else across India.

They also serve Trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
And they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

Everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and I can vouch for that!!!! They're pricey but worth it!!!

Drinks-
Beer: La trappe Trippel (Bottled)
Witte
Beer sampler- (The caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
Dubbel
Belgian Kreik
Chamborlette
Erdinger Weisbier
Erdinger Dunkel
Schuimpzuiper
Miss spicy - They mean it when they say spicy
Barbar blond (bottled)

Jenever shots (Pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
A type of Dutch Gin produced only in Europe with juniper flavour

These were absolutely amazing
The smoothest shots I've ever had

Smeets bessen Jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
Citroen Jenever- Citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
Wafel Jenever- Hands down the best shot I've had. Ever.
Tastes like waffle syrup. Notes of caramel and pop corn. Sweet, smooth and simply sublime

Project 51- Brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

Mango mint mocktail- Super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

Food

Food was pretty good. We tried
Lasooni Murgh
Lamb chops - Tender and well cooked
Fries
Cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
Florentine saute mushrooms
Chickpea corn masala - Good stuff to munch on while having drinks. Had alot of Peanuts.
Cilantro grilled fish- Tasted pretty Indian
Grilled fish with rice - Recommended
Saucy chest nuts
Chilli garlic prawns - Not very garlicky or spicy
Veg assorted pizza- Pretty good for a bar
Choco lava cake

The food wasn't too oily or spicy. Well flavoured and served warm.

Over all rating- 4.5/5 ( Only because there pricey)
Food- 4/5
Drinks- 4.9/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 4.5/5

Would I go back here? Hell yes"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Satwinder Singh,15 November 2018,4,"Nice place this.
Excellent choice in Beers, probably amongst the best in Hyderabad.
Sober ambiance and good music
Wonderful mix of crowd and some okay dishes served up.

We tried the Egg Manchuria was pretty unique and then it was the Spicy Fried Idli was off beat
The Chicken tikka was standard

A little spicy on your pocket, but what the heck a few beers don‚Äôt harm..

Although the service could have been a little more prompt.

See the TILT in the Beer ;)  !!

The Tilt Bar Republic,Sidhant Girglani,04 November 2018,3,"I have only one word.... mediocre.... We went there thinking it would have good music and nice decor but it had neither. Since we were not drinking, the menu also seemed very limited. Go there if you wanna drink n snack, but then there are cheaper places which offer both with a better ambience."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Gourav Bhattacharya,04 November 2018,5,It was almost after an decade I landed in Hyd and Zomato came in rescue for my Saturday night. I always feel the substance of the place is paramount and Tilt Bar won't dissapoint you. CraftB served here is smooth as the breeze and i got so drenched till the closing. Erdinger beer matched my DNA and with amazing pizza and garlic bread spread with cheese ball must for Vegetarian's. Lamb served was good and so was chicken. I so lived that night at Tilt's.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Anjali Sharma,01 November 2018,4,"I've been here a couple of times. Love their beer collection, specially, La Trappe Witte. The bruschetta(s) are amazing. Food overall was good. If you want to get away from all those noisy places and just spend quality time with friends, this is the place to go. Great beer, good food and nice music is a deadly combination. A must try place!"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Harleyquinnspace,22 October 2018,5,Absolutely Awesome Beers. Almost forgot how a Belgian Beer Tastes like and this place is a paradise for me and my mates. Never thought I'd find such a place in Hyderabad. My Pudding had Hobgoblin which got his rare good side up and I had Witte - the god of all Beers. This will be our pub for next few years and will inform our fellow mates to check this place out ASAP.
The Tilt Bar Republic,Noopur Baldwa,20 October 2018,3,"Food and ambiance was good. The drawback was the service. We ordered Saucy Chestnut and they took almost an hour to serve it. Each time we asked the manager he said it will be served in 5 minutes. There was also a spider on our table, thankfully after we finished our food. Informed the manager again. He Couldn‚Äôt care less."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Niraj Gupta,12 October 2018,4,"Great variety of tap and bottle beers that cater to almost every kind of palate.  Food was above average, specially recommend their Cilantro fish."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Vineet,10 October 2018,4.5,"Had a wonderful time here with frnds. ...If you like to like beers then this is the right place for you. They nice varieties of beers we tried the La trappe Witte and eddenger wibber which is very light and smooth, I liked it ...and in the food we just tried nachos which was decent. Overall we enjoyed it."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Phani Varma,05 October 2018,5,"A friend of mine recommended this place .....The best part of this place is the variety of Beers that are available. Very few places in Hyderabad where beer taste is nice and it will be one of them.

Food is above average and Ambience is nice. Sports lovers can hangout here enjoying their drinks."

The Tilt Bar Republic,Sandeep Raja,03 October 2018,3,"Went with our colleagues last week and had a good lunch over there. Coming to ambience it is quite dark with sufficient light . Am quite impressed with the furniture with minimalistic design.
Food which didn‚Äôt impressed me much . Options are less. Pasta is terrific . Miloxktails are the best among all. They had their own flavours which is not copied somewhere ."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Syam,29 September 2018,1,"If you have not tasted sauce....go to Tilt. Went yesterday ..beer is ok...
Cilantra fish...tastes only of sauce
Chilli Lamb....tastes only of sauce
Chilli egg...tastes only of sauce
Mutton kebab....doesn't taste like anything...

Sad to say...the most overpriced and shittiest food I have ever tasted in Hyderabad..
One star for the beer and masala peanuts....

On top of that they tried to scam us by charging a whopping service charge..."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Anil Pajjuri,26 September 2018,4,"Nice ambience , good food. Got discount for zomato gold, service was on prompt .. overall nice place to hang out..
Pasta was delicious .
Must visit place"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Abhishek Durvasula,21 September 2018,4,"Good ambience.
The food was great. We tried veg platter and schezwan noodles.
I liked the beer best. Lots of brews available. Each flavour was different. I loved Barbar and Green Killer IPA.

Waiters were courteous and prompt.

The only thing I was not satisfied about was the cleanliness in general. Tables were a bit greasy."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Marsha,21 September 2018,4,"I went to this place for a date and absolutely loved it. The layout , lighting, music is perfect for a romantic dinner. Even if you are with friends and don't want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food, good company and the Indian team on a large screen :P. The staff is very very good (one of the best) .For the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the match.When we were undecided about what to order, one of them politely suggested a Fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty! Cilantro fish is a must try here. I could have easily had another plate.The softness..the perfect marination..the taste of coriander...i loved it.Then i ordered the Non veg platter and I had wished i had just taken another suggestion :(. I didn't like prawn tempura at all.Pepper chicken,Soya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish.
For drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choices.He got me a Belgian Kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juice.I loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth. My friend tried Erginder Dunkel - this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromas.I took a sip and liked it but i liked mine better.:P. Then came the best part of our dinner - the choco lava cake! The ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut it.Complete foodgasm! One of the best choco lavas i have had.I m gonna visit this place quite frequently :D"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Rajendra Swain,19 September 2018,5,"This is my second visit to tilt bar . Loved the ambience of the place . This Time I really enjoyed with food specially live counter pasta (prepare by prahallad panda) such a amazing taste , the service also very quick and the staffs are very friendly . Even they have amazing drinks and the place is really cozy and not a very loud."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Aniket,18 September 2018,5,Good food. Good ambience. Good service. Went for lunch and dinner. Casual place to hangout..Starters are really nice. And they really bring the food fast..
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sambhangi Sandeep,18 September 2018,4,"Nice Italian and English food. We tried Alfredo Pasta veg and Fish and Chips ! Both of em tasted yummy! The place was busy on Tue evenings too, we haven‚Äôt tired no drinks, so got no clue."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sunil Khatri,13 September 2018,3,"I would rate ambience hardly at three and doesn't look like the pics on Zomato. The place was smelly and even the AC wasn't working well. 
Beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down. They don't have an in-house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too. In comparison to it, there are a lot of places to try in-house brewed beers like OTM brewery etc.
Even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza I had in a long time, just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 Bucks. Similar experience with fish and chips, the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish.
Really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as I went with high hopes. I don't recommend this to anyone because it's not even cheap to recommend to those who don't want to spend much."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Akhil Mahajan,11 September 2018,5,"Thankyou zomato that i found this place. I have never had this amazing belgium beer. Amazing variety. The best was their white wheat german beer. The fruit belgian beer was also good. We ordered barbeque chicken which was good.
The service is amazing and service people do their best to make your visit amazing"
The Tilt Bar Republic,Komal Mathur,10 September 2018,5,"Went there two times and ordered one same dish i.e. Grilled fish with rice and I must say it's flawless...it should be there signature dish.
Other dishes were tasty too. Liked their service...well trained staff. Overall a good place to enjoy."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Kunal Agarwal,09 September 2018,3,"It is located in the heart of Gachibowli but the service was not as expected, delay service and then the food was not that good. The ambience was good though, they need to improve their service as well as the food . I hope the management will look into the above points so that the next time we plan to visit we get a good food and service."

The Mexican pizza was delicious."
The Tilt Bar Republic,Sachin Sherikar,09 September 2018,1,Terrible staff. I don't remember when the last time I saw such horrible and unorganized staff. Most of the staff isn't aware of what order is being placed. They end up getting the stuffs from their which you haven't ordered. We had to wait for over an hour for our main course and then the food was also a big disappointment.

Best part here is their starters, desserts and chat items. Here jelebi with rabdi is extremely super üòã. Service was bit slow but their respect towards customers made us forget that. Only area where they can improve is the main course options. Thanks Indi Grill for giving us one of the finest lunches ever we had."

The Indi Grill,Harikrishna Prabhu,15 May 2019,2,Went here for a team outing. The restaurant caters to masses from the corporate sector. Not great spread on the buffet.

A great variety in the grill items however the deserts could have been a little less sweeter. The dishes well liked were crispy corn, green apple fox, and angoori gulab jamun. Ice creams and custard lacked their respective flavours which was a disappointment. Surely would like to visit again expecting the above changes are made. :)"

As usual it was Soo rush and waiters and staff over there are in hurry to serve us fast and want to throw us out of the restaurant.üòê
Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
They want us to give the rating infront of them
Finally
Ambience-3/5
Food-2/5
Service-4/5"

The Indi Grill,Dyagamrahul,02 May 2019,4,"Went for a lunch Buffet yesterday and we were around 17 ppl.

The best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.

Ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.

Coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. But they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.

We have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. They were just amazing.

We have Tawa chicken and Prawns but that was not up to the mark and that Tawa items needs a huge change in taste.

Main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like Laal Maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)

Coming to Desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite Jilebi with Rabdi, asked for some hot Jilebi at the end as well, I got a few.
Kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.

Overall experience is good. It needs some minor changes in few dishes.

Must visit place for non veg lovers."

The Indi Grill,Prabhjot Sandhu,30 April 2019,2,Went with lots of hope that its a subsidiary of moti mahal group of hotels but i will just say there is hindi poverb in India NAAM BADE OR DARSHAN CHOTE ....
The Indi Grill,Harika Reddy,30 April 2019,4,"This was totally an accidental visit,i had no idea about this place before we stepped into this one except for the fact that it's a bbq place,as the name suggests.It's two floored building beautifully lit,i was here for dinner.We opted for first floor,they immediately got the grill and the buffet starts.It's like any other bbq place but with high quality food.The starters are so very fresh,i definitely give it one of the best bbq places in the city.The menu was pretty much the same,the chicken wings deserves a special mention,we repeated it like 3 times 'AWE'mazing.The main course was decent,the dessert section was again okay specially -pan shot-was like a panflavoured liquid in shot glasses and i loved it.Everything was pretty much decent but what made me love this place more was the service.The service is amazing,shout out to ASHRAF AND REETHAM.They made our experience more pleasant. The only complain about this place is the playlist,(more of old and sad bollywood songs) it was so loud and it totally is a huge off.I suggest please change the playlist guys,it's ruining the whole vibe of the place,this is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying it.Anyways,i liked the unexpected visit to this place."
The Indi Grill,Abhishek Mahapatro,30 April 2019,4,"We were 31 people went together for a lunch buffet on 22nd April. Tables were arranged on 1st floor for us and no one else were allowed which is a plus for big group. Coming to menu its kind of same what all bbq places are offering now a days. Taste was good for most of the items. Staffs were polite and quick on services. Only thing which didnt went well was AC of the resturant. As it was a hot afternoon, AC was not enough to cool us downüòï. Manger apologized for this. They also gave us a 10% off on total bill because of 20+ people.

Advices to management = Please have some unique food item which is not there on other places.
Looking forward to visit again."

The Indi Grill,Gyan,29 April 2019,4,"This restaurant has got a good location and interior. In The buffet menu, the starters and grilled items are good, but the main course need serious improvements. Main course dishes are average and not up to mark. I think the price is also quite high in comparison to its dishes."

Good food at great price."

The Indi Grill,Gopal Bhargav,27 April 2019,4,"After hearing good reviews about this, we went for lunch buffet. First and foremost thing you will notice is the courteousness of the staff there. Once you book the table, they write your name on a board outside. We took the seat in the first level as the ground floor was full. Starters were served. Veg starters were too spicy,but very tasty. Its better you mention them the spice level before itself. Even main course was pretty good in terms of taste. Nothing much special in the menu but taste and staff were good. ""BALA"" who served us was very courteous. Please give him a star."
The Indi Grill,Jayant Shekhar,26 April 2019,5,"After months of trying out buffet restaurants in and around Gachibowli, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that EVERYTHING about The Indi Grill was worth the visit. One of the rare places where you'll find consistent quality across dishes - starters, main course, and dessert. Jalebi does require a special mention.

Combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience.

I would recommend visiting the place in the first slot, as things are reasonably quiet. Not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded!

If I had to be really critical, the veg menu has that tiny scope of improvement in an otherwise perfect place. Keep it going!"
The Indi Grill,Dronamraju Saianilkumar,26 April 2019,5,I had a team dinner on Friday night.The food was really awesome mouthwatering.we enjoyed lot with loud music here .we got the amazing service by team Indigril. For sure we visit again to this place. Folk Must try The Indigril.

The Indi Grill,Kriti Jain,21 April 2019,4,"Overall food was good. Anytime better than BBQ Nation. Salad options could have been improved. Menu was loaded with regional foods like Gatte ki Sabji of Rajasthan, Bengali Fish Curt. Etc. However, Gatte ki Sabji not at all upto the mark"
The Indi Grill,Avinash Baratam,21 April 2019,4,Good place to have food here for a typical South Indians who would like to enjoy Barbeque food. ambience and service are mesmerising which made us show interest towards having food
The Indi Grill,Akshay Kirti,20 April 2019,4,"One of the latest buffet places in town. Visited there last weekend for lunch. Quite a big place with good decor. Staff were helpful and service was quick. I loved the starters there. Chicken leg kebab, other chicken starter were also very good. The best was prawns, tandoori prawns were just amazing. Crispy corn, salsa potato and pineapple were also available. Main course also had good variety from chicken, mutton to fish. Desserts were also good. Loved the galebi and rabdi the most"
The Indi Grill,Manoj Katragadda,19 April 2019,3,"Food= Taste and variety of food items=3/5
Ambience = Look and Feel=3/5
Service= Timely service and Cleanliness=2.5/5
Pocket= Quantity vs Price =5/5
Value= Quality=4/5

When it comes to spread of items, they were just too many. Barbeque items, main course as well as desserts. The taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction. Ambience was just average.

Service definitely needs a heavy improvement. We went on a non rush day, serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service. There is no concept of coming to the table second time. No one really really bothered the table. Even after requesting so many times, servers really didn't bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items. We just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch. Mutton Curry and biryani were extra ordinary. Jalebi served in desserts was too good"
The Indi Grill,Vidya Bharti (Traod_thefoodietraveller),18 April 2019,3,This restro is located in Gachibowli in The Platina building. We headed to this place for dinner with team on Friday evening...The place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly too..The service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestions..Now coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like ABs or Barbeque Nation they still lag behind with the same price..The starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok..
The Indi Grill,Nikhil Choudary,17 April 2019,5,The food and the ambience is good special thanks to the service they are good. It is recommended for the people who like to have food peace and spicy

The Indi Grill,Santosh Pappachan,11 April 2019,4,"This is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the Moti Mahal chain of restaurants.

Hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner. The starters have mostly the usual fare you'd see in a typical barbeque restaurant. There was chicken, fish, prawn, mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangdi, chicken meat balls etc. in the non veg fare. The veg had the typical paneer, pineapple, corn on the cob, crispy potatoes in sauce which I would say were delectable along with the crispy corns. There is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke I ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking.

The chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty. I also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course. They were soft and had the right texture and taste. Just the way they should be. Special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing. My wife had multiple rounds of the same. The chicken, fish and mutton curries were good but I liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot. The gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section.

The service was quick and prompt. Special mention of Raghuveer Singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required. This is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about. They have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus. All in all, this is definitely a place worth trying!"
The Indi Grill,The Hungry Indians,10 April 2019,4,"Located in the busy streets of kondapur this one gains quite an attention
Indigrill is a chain of the grand Moti Mahal restaurants
Set up in ground and first floors has a decent ambience
For present they are only running buffet section but they are going to start A-la-carte soon
.
.
We have been invited to try their buffet section
Welcomed by the friendly staff we have been served first with their welcome drink
Then moving on to the grill they had chicken fish and prawns on BBQ in non veg
Fish and prawns tasted great while chicken was a little hard
In vegetarian paneer mushroom and pineapple were served
Apart from grill they had other starters too
Mutton sheek kabab served here is one of the best I ever had
Fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
And crabs were little but slow cooked and prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing
.
.
We were almost filled with starters but their main course spread is huge too
My favorites were
Crab curry and mutter paneer
.
.
And in desserts
Gulad jamun and jilebi with rabdi were lip smacking
Strawberry pudding and phirni tasted good too"
The Indi Grill,Rajsi Gaikwad,09 April 2019,4,"This place is nice for formal dinners and family dinners. It's a comfortable place and the service was quick.
Barbeque and starters was good here but the food here was average."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Food O‚ÄôClock,25 May 2019,5,"This place is highly recommended. It is working with Eat India Company under the same roof, may be kitchen as well. Basically u ca order any of the two‚Äôs menu from one table. Eat India Company has Indian food while Urban Asia has asian food like chinese, thai food, etc.

We ordered The Real Bangkok Basa, Chef/Subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles and Sanghai Fried Rice from Urban Asia.

The Real Bangkok Basa- It tastes so good. It was steamed Fish and mixed with some green sauce. Taste was 5/5 .

Subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies, mushroom, chicken. Taste 5/5

Sanghai Fried Rice was a mixed of noodles and rice in which noodles was more than the rice. Taste was 5/5

Service 4/5, little bit slow in bringing food.

Ambiance 4/5"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ravi Shankar Gupta,24 May 2019,5,We had evening dinner at this restaurant. Food was delicious. We had Chinese as well as north indian. Both were delicious. I recommend for weekend food with family here
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rajshekher. 92,24 May 2019,5,"The staff is kind and I think that's the moto of the Restaurant. The food is delicious, and there is the option for buffet and Alacarte, so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table, which is really a good thing for me because I went with my parent. Coming to the food special I like the most, corn cube, prawn, fish, and yes ofcourse murgh angara..the staff cares about all its customers and are polite, just amazing..
Food 4.5
Ambience 3.5
Service 5
Diffenitly will be back with my team cheers.."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vamsi Krishna,23 May 2019,1,"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner only to be served the worst quality food. The service was absolutely terrible... no air conditioning in the sweltering heat ... after multiple requests we got our food ( literally begged for the food to be served)... what‚Äôs not there on the buffet menu also they don‚Äôt tell the customer... the main course was served cold... pre-scooped ice creams.. and what not

Some mango juice they served... don‚Äôt know how that was drinkable ....

Worst decision to spend our evening here .. absolutely terrible experience

Giving one star because I can‚Äôt give -5

FOOD = -100/5
Service - can‚Äôt put a negative number that high
Ambience - no air conditioning on a summer evening
Price ‚Äî not worth even 1/5th"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Arunraj R,21 May 2019,5,I ordered a Thai curry which is to die for . The waiters were so polite. The best thing in this place is that it's calm and quiet. It's a good place to relax and enjoy great food.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Aditya Rastogi,12 May 2019,1,"The place is not worth going. Too overrated and over priced. From starters to desserts, the food is not worth the money and not tasty. They don't charge properly for Zomato gold, you have to check the bill carefully for the items deducted under gold 2+2. I would rate the place as:
Food- 2/5
Ambiance- 3/5
Service-3.5/5
Value for money- 2/5"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Yashwanth Kota,07 May 2019,4,"Simply the best Asian restaurant in the city. So fresh and lively food. This will enhance your health as well. I am vegetarian and I like the way they decorate and combine the veggies. Must try corn cubes, vegetable pan fried noodles. 4 star for the service which needs improvement."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Radhika Burra,28 April 2019,3,"This is my second visit to this place. Like the Ambience much and cool place to chill out. Had been there along with a friend for dinner. We didn't want to go for Buffet for sure, so it was ala carte.

Angara Murgu Kabab, Rara Ghost and Butter Naan... Starter was with much salt and lemon... Rara Ghost is nice, perfection at it's best... Was a good combination with Butter Naan...

Service was very nice and as I said earlier nice ambience..."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pushkar Shah,26 April 2019,3,"Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the ""Signature"" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Bhavani Sankar Raju Machiraju,15 April 2019,3,We have been there for team dinner for a buffet. Ambience is good. Food is decent but serving is not at all good. You can neglect this as we have lot of options aroubd Gachibowli
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Nag Vamc,11 April 2019,4,This is one of the favourite food spots in Jubilee Hills but this outlet they have started in Gachibowli too been here with cousin..checked out Menu for having different thing and ordered starter Corn and Cheese Crudettes in smoked Butter Garlic..it was really yummy and the best starters I had in recent times and had Aamir‚Äôs and Gautam‚Äôs Anda Bandi Fried the name itself was catchy..Taste was also perfect..was spicy and Yummy
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Thejoyoffood,09 April 2019,4,"Amongst the so many options now available for dining at Gachibowli, Urban Asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food. Getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane. However, they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants. The place offers both buffet and a-la-carte options and you could choose what you like. We ordered Pad Thai noodle and chilly Tofu. I have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. Moreover, the portion size was fairly decent. The Pad Thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife's liking but again flavoursome and good portion. The place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace. The staff is courteous and service is prompt."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Durgesh Thakur,07 April 2019,5,"Used to be a frequent visitor at this place. Was total disappointed yesterday night . Food was aweful to taste. Chicken starter in bean sauce was bitter in taste. They we're serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order. Chicken lababdar was wanting in taste, fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup , no one was nearby when serving were required. Service is what we look forward to when dining in your restaurant.Either there was change in chef or some other temporary issues. Hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Francissalethu,03 April 2019,4,The place has the best Asian food options. The nasi Goreng here is authentic and taste like it not like other restaurants where they just give u fried rice. The pork fried rice is very tasty as well.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Tinni Ghosh,27 March 2019,2,"I went to Urban Asia on a date and we had planned to have sushi. Sushi was not available at all. We were heartbroken. ""Sorry Sir"" became the theme that night. Date went dull."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Arka Majumder,26 March 2019,5,"The staffs are very Friendly and polite... This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad, i suggest this place to all the people who love authentic oriental cuisine."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Peri,25 March 2019,5,"Ambience is just decent, but The food is justtttt mouth watering!!!Have tried Nyonya- it was heaven....A must try dish!! The signature dishes are the best.."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Supraja.prasad,22 March 2019,4,"Visited on a weekday for a quick dinner. Ordered the Kung pao chicken , mojito and schezwan noodles. Food was very delicious especially the king pao chicken. Will definitely go back to explore more."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Apoorva Idya,22 March 2019,1,The food was not made well and the service needs a lot of improvement. The pad thai was too sticky and the thai green curry was very watery. They didnot have ice to make drinks and we were kept waiting for a very long time for the bill. The outlet needs better management. Unhappy with my visit here.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,ThePanda,04 March 2019,1,"We have been to Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar, Gachibowli. We ordered crisp noodles (shrimps) with sweet and sour sauce which was obviously a wrong choice. Crispy noodles is never a right choice (at least for me) wherever you go and sweet n sour soup with shrimps just made it worse. I am a seafood lover and the quantity and size of shrimps didn't justify its price. Next was Standing Pomfret dish in schezwan sauce...which turned out to be a disappointment. Who prepares pomfret in all-purpose flour? It was not good at all."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shreyasi Pal,02 March 2019,5,"Love this place for food. I recommend Tamang chilli chicken , heaven on a place . Hakka noodles not so impressive. I always go for √† la carte . Buffet menu not so tempting. Staffs are courteous and service is good ."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ananth Popuri,26 February 2019,5,"Food is very nice, especially chilli lamb and honey chilli potato is amazing. Good thing with this restaurant is it consists of three different menus, the thing I'm saying is we can eat three different restaurants menu food in single place. Drinks collection is also good."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Hrishikesh Sathe,26 February 2019,3,"Food - 4
Service - 3

The food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress. Had ordered Lotus leaf fried rice - but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil, but what lets you down is the service - Too SLOW.

And they also goofed up on the Zomato 1+1 food offer. They later corrected it, but not before arguing.

Will I go here again - YES, but not the Gachibowli joint. The other Urban Asia at Jubilee hills is a way better!"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Chaitanya Reddy,24 February 2019,3,"Sushi was bad,
Starters were okay ,
I don't understand why there waso muglai / Indian food and not Asian food in an restraunt which specialises in Asian cuisine."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,^beingRAJAT,23 February 2019,3,"Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
Like 50% of an all."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Greedy Hippo,18 February 2019,4,"On a Saturday casual lunch, i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up. And I couldn't stop looking at the artifacts they have put up. Its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of India.

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

I loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. It has stuck on my taste buds.

Taste: 4
Service :4
Ambiance : 5
Value for money : 4"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shw Nick,18 February 2019,4,"Amazing place with historical collection , collected from Rajasthan.
Staff are so cooperative and Goody Foody is so so so tasty ....

Asian food k deewano must go n try ..

Before ordering make sure you check with staff ingredients used in Japanese / Chinese food."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Harshitha Machiraju,17 February 2019,3,"Good food. Recommend the garlic fried rice and fried ice cream. The veg dimsums are also very good. The only problem is the service, it's a bit slow."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Soumi Mukherjee,16 February 2019,5,THIS IS MY MOST FAVOURITE CHINESE ASIAN CUISINE JOINT HERE. I have been to this place a couple of times and their food is absolutely to die for. The buttet garlic rice and the green curry is lipsmackingly good. In appetisers I love the pork dumplings which are white balls of juiciness and the pork ribs that completely melt in your mouth. The staff is helpful and courteous. Absolutely love everything about this place.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Megha Narayana,13 February 2019,4,I have only been to this place once and I cannot forget the noodles I had! I never found that texture or taste in noodles anywhere else. I love it! The quantity is too much for a single person and good for 2. So do try it out!
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Aniket Pal,29 January 2019,5,Great experience. Awesomely decorated inside. Very calm and quiet atmosphere. Appropriate place for both couple and family dining. Food quality is also delicious. Great service.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Karthik Vempa,29 January 2019,4,Ambience is not as good as the one in Jubilee hills. But kudos to them for maintaining the same taste. Courteous staff. Gets a bit crowded towards the weekend so better to book a table prior. They have tie up with zomato for booking table which is good. Tried the famous Narsi goreng and it lived up to the expectation.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,AK-ansha Chaudhary,28 January 2019,2,Firstly my cocktail was messed up and than paneer lababdar with pathetic gravy was too bad to consume. Overall food experience was bad. I would never recommend this place to any of my friends or peer
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Gayatri Tandon,28 January 2019,4,"Pretty nice place with great food! I initially thought it would be costlier, but they have quite a lot of quantity, which is great! Overall it's quite a cool place"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Debasmita Ghosh,23 January 2019,4,"Extremely pleased to have visited this place and experiment with their masterpiece. I was disappointed as they didnt serve sushi on the day we visited, but rest of the food compensated for the grief. The pork ribs were amazing! The nasi goreng was something i was looking forward and it didn‚Äôt disappoint me. Also the heaven on plate. The quantity they serve is too good, one main course can be shared by two with moderate appetite. The decor was amazing too but what was best about this place were the courteous and highly spontaneous staff. The fried icecream too was good , they served extra chocolate sauce on request. must try this gem of a place!"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shouvik Acharyya,22 January 2019,1,"This place is nothing as it is shown in the images. The ambience maybe good, but the service is too bad. The chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as I thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp. And if this was not enough the add on was the main course. The name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food, which creates a lot of confusion. We ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies, rather than semi gravy. The worst is the suggestions from the manager, who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered. Knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy, it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them. Moreover despite of showing the Zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food, they added an extra service charge to the final bill. Won't complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing.
My suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking, and importantly don't try and take suggestion from the management.
Been to many Asian restaurants, had bad food, but never got so confused about the menu. I had Sandip Acharyya with me. Both of us are very dissapointed.
A big no no to this place."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shaan Wins Veigas,19 January 2019,3,"The lamb dish was good, but the pork was undercooked. Better avoid pork here. Coz that could be dangerous. The ambience is good. The decor is warm with heritage wooden doors, pillars n other elements from old Rajasthan havelis."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Kunal Khanra,16 January 2019,5,"Amazing interior, heartwarming services, affordable price and wow food! The quantity was more than adequate too! We ordered pork ribs, heaven on a plate, fried ice cream and Nasi goreng. A must visit place!"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Meghana Nandiraju,15 January 2019,3,"First visit

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rishav Sarkar,13 January 2019,5,"Visited this branch of Urban Asia this afternoon for lunch. The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don‚Äôt like sweet dishes. May be it‚Äôs the authentic Orange Chicken)
All together good experience. Staff is also very courteous and professional."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Satish,07 January 2019,1,"If you want to taste really bad sushi, this is the best place in town. But given that my review has to be atleast 140 characters long - I repeat they are the best at serving the worst sushi."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Komal Mathur,05 January 2019,4,"Always feel good to visit Urban Asia...and now the best thing is we can enjoy both Urban Asia and eat India's food together.
Food- 4/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service-5/5"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Nikhil Chauhan,02 January 2019,3,"Great food. Esp the Know Suey. Starters were good as well. Service by the attendants was poor. Delayed orders after multiple follow ups. Great ambience. Mild music. Mild air conditioning. Very clean. Definitely try the fried prawns as part of the starters. Wasabi needs to be more like the real wasabi. They need to serve the sushi along with the wasabi and soy sauce provided in small bowls - the bowls we're missing. And you had to ask for the wasabi as well. Should be part of the table sauces, etc. Good to go there once in a while."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Karpurmanjari Kakati,02 January 2019,3,"We opted for alakarte here. But the took a round of the food variety for buffet, it was pretty good. But the dessert section didn't interest me much.

The buffet had dumplings, sushi, which I felt were food for buffet.

We we in mood to eat proper Chinese. We ordered a pork dimsum, stir fried chicken starter.
Another chicken main course and fried rice.

Everything was good.

But then comes the bill part.

I Really don't know how they missed the Zomato 1+1 to cut from the bill.
Also they had so 91 bucks extra S. Tax apart from GST.
Which made us change the bill again.

Honestly speaking, after serving good food, missing the gold and adding extra money apart from GST decreases the moral value for the place.

Kindly try avoiding the addition of that.

Rest food is good.
Service if good.
Can come back again for another turn of Chinese.!!"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vijay Chandra,26 December 2018,1,"The rating for the food taste is always 4/5 here but when comes to service I can't rate more than 1.5/5, the 0.5 is just for getting bill quickly and may be 1 for getting few dishes immediately. I visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time, but it is always degrading. We came in to Lunch at around 2:45, the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and I complained then they went and heated it up and served, this was corn cubes, they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all. I had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served. I think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before, I went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it. I really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted. It was absolutely ridiculous experience, they started turning off the lights when we're still eating, I agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness? It is no more pathetic situation, like they are not bothered about the customers, and we can get in if we want. I was always thinking Urban Asia is a premium place for good food and service, but it proved other wise."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Bagga,24 December 2018,4,"Went here for a family dinner on a weeknight. Ambience is nice, we were seated by a nice table by the glass wall. Service was very good as we got started with a manager standing close by and ensuring service was happening briskly. Two of us went with the buffet and others went ala carte. The buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. Veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. Budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while. We didn't have much appetite after the starters so that was good. Lots of little desserts - pastries looked better than they tasted, but kids enjoyed the ice cream cold stone. Overall experience was quite good for all of us - attentive service always goes a long way and we will be back."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vedika1003,21 December 2018,1,"Terrible experience. The place was crowded and noisy. The food had an odd smell to it, it almost tasted like they were using expired ingredients. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Srikanth Goud,21 December 2018,1,Completely disappointed. If people are going for a team lunch or dinner please go for a better place. Service is worst. Until and unless we ask they are not bringing anything. Food is average. Starters are very less. Ambience is just ok. Not recomended.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ashish Chandran,18 December 2018,5,"delicious food for best price,good ambiance and awesome serving. Had good time here... this restaurant is a combination of good food and appearance with mild music. had fun ü§òüèª"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Harishankar Patel,15 December 2018,5,"If you want to try something new from the daily routine taste,try dinning out once in Urban Asia and you will love everything about it.. Give your taste buds a try for the ""crispy kai in Bangkok curry"" for starter and the cheese balls are mesmerizing .. For main course you definitely try the ""bamboo fried rice"" and the Malaysian curry combo.. you will love it.... And if your love is for Noodles.. Padh Thai will take your breath away with it's coconut flavoury mouthwatering taste... The soothing music is cherry on the cake. A fine Dinning and Urban Asia is way to go...

S K Allaudin is very good with handling the service and gave all of us an amazing experience."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Harsha Galla,14 December 2018,5,"The food is really good and so are the staff. Their thai green curry is awesome. It‚Äôs usually crowded, so its best to call before you go. The restaurant shares the kitchen with another restaurant, so you get the benefit of choosing from two menus, so dont have to worry which one to go to :P"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ritam Das,13 December 2018,5,Awesome food and very good staff.. well behaviour... Specialy thanks to Mr. Sk. Alauddin he take care us very well.. thanks u buddy. . And Ur management.... Cheers up buddy...thanks u... Good pan Asian food...
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Lokesh Jain,13 December 2018,3,"Ambience decent , parking to the place is an issue . Tom yum soup good , paneer tikka ok , lotus stem ok . Service average, steward Sk was not upto the mark , he looked totally off mood . Chilli garlic noodles was outstanding, manchow fried rice was delicious"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Mihir Bathia,13 December 2018,5,Food was amazing and the ambience is good. It's nice to go there with family and friends. It's little expensive but the food taste is too good
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ishu Gupta,11 December 2018,4,This is my go-to place for Asian food cravings. The spread is good. The food is good and leaves you wanting more. Must try If you are looking for authentic Asian food.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Anirban De,10 December 2018,2,The service is very bad. They are not offering the seats when they have whole restaurant empty. The food is good but the manager and staffs are not that encouraging.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Gaurav Gupta (GG),06 December 2018,3,Visited Urban Asia two times and had moderate experience. Food taste is pretty but service is very very slow. Staff took more than 20 min to serve the food initially and reordering was like endless waiting. Buffet services seems better than ala carte.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shail Choudhary,04 December 2018,4,"We decided to go to Eat India Company for dinner, then found that it in conjunction with Urban Asia, Good for us, as we got the opportunity to try both the restaurants. Food was good so was the service, prices were moderate to high. The Place is located on the busy foodie street of Gachibowli, good that valet parking is there."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhra Das,25 November 2018,4,We ordered a fish starter along with main course. Food was good . Tasted quite fresh and authentic. Quality and quantity both were satisfying. The restaurant is in the same floor of Eat India Company and shares same service.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Sourav Datta,18 November 2018,4,"A beautiful Asian restaurant with awesome food.

Food : 4.5/5 Tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu. The soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special. The dumplings were really good, it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust. The dumpling dip could have been better though. The Nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world. The Nasi Goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy. Have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers Indian and Asian together. The green curry in the buffet was again very delicious.

Ambiance : 3.5/5 This is actually two restaurant under the same roof. I am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense.

Service : 4/5 Service was again very good. They took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly.

Price : 3.5/5 It is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair. The only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Amol Chaitanya,17 November 2018,4,"Nice place to enjoy some south east asian food.. ambiance is decent, service is good, the food is decent.. dishes are not too highly priced!!"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Siddhartha Krishna,08 November 2018,5,Very nice place and nice service . The person serving us was very helpful. We enjoyed the Chinese starters and also main course. Would like to visit again and try fixed menu of theirs . Only improvement they can keep Chinese in fixed menu too
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Gamya Goli,06 November 2018,1,"Extremely bad food at the gachibowli location. I had ordered food for a party and was delivered stale food despite informing that I am ordering the food for kids. One of the child got food poisoned aswell.

I informed the management about this and they did not even get back to check on how the kid (who fell sick) was doing.

Extremely poor food quality and hospitality. Was thoroughly embarrassed in front of the guests and regret having chosen this restaurant for my event."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Karan Dadure,04 November 2018,4,"It is two restaurants under the same roof, really don't know why so, because they present you the menu of both at either place. Not sure if they share the kitchen and chef too. 
We ordered from Urban Asia's menu, and the food was good. The service, on the other hand, is a little disappointing probably because of the confusion between the restaurants. 
Ordered some lamb starters and thai curry red. The Thai Curry was great and the remained for hours in my mouth."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pavan Rishit Meka,31 October 2018,3,"This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names.

‚úìAmbience

This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings.

‚úìFood

We went here for a dinner buffet. The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters. All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

Dinner Buffer Menu:

*Starters:

1. Murgh Haryali Tikka
2. Lahsooni Murgh Tikka
3. Kung Pao Fish
4. Prawns Parsely dry
5. Crispy Potato Corn cube
6. Sichuan Baby Corn
7. Paneer Angar Tikka
8. Corn Tikka
9. French fries

*Main Course:

1. Bindi Jai Puri
2. Yellow Dal Tadka
3. Palak Paneer
4. Murgh Lababdar
5. Mutton do Pyaza
6. Murgh Dum biryani
7. Sabzi Dum biryani
8. Garlic noodles
9. Butter Naan and Roti
10. Curd Rice
11. Khow suey

*Salads:

1. Tossed Salad
2. Crispy Noodles Salad
3. Kimchi Salad
4. Grilled chicken salad

*Desserts:

1. Pineapple Tarts
2. Chocolate Brownie
3. Pastries
4. Shahi Tukda
5. Varied flavors of ice creams.

We don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

‚úìService

The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. Though it is a buffet, All the starters will served to the table. There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

‚úìValue for money

The dinner buffet here costs around Rs.650/- per person. And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy. Have a great dining and good dayüòä"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pratik Kundu,27 October 2018,5,"We had a great time in Urban Asia, have been coming here for the last 1 year and as usual their service and their food is amazing. Our server today SK Alauddin was very helpful and suggested the right combination of food to have. Apart from this, he was also very polite and had decent knowledge about Asian cuisine"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Fit Foodie,25 October 2018,4,"Food - 3.5
Ambience - 4
Service - 3.5
VFM - 4

This restaurant has Eat India Company and Urban Asia merged into one. So u get both North Indian and Asian cuisine menus together. Bit confusing at the start, especially because the waiters don't address this.
Ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. Like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
Next up was chicken dumpling. This was yummy.
Chicken Thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for Thai curry. Think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of Asian food, otherwise the food was fresh and tasty."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pradeep Yadlapati,19 October 2018,5,Great food. The spread was really nice. Has good selection for kids and adults. Soup and starter were awesome and your journey to great food starts. Kids loved the ice cream counter and desserts.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Aditya Dixit,19 October 2018,5,"I was here today with my family and what struck me the most was the amazing service offered. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful and took good care of my 3 year old son. Must say, he really enjoyed all the pampering he was being offered. With regards to the food, we went in for the buffet and were a bit late for lunch. Hence focused more on the starters. Must say the starters were amazing, loved the prawns the most from the bunch! The place has a spacious seating arrangement and a relatively good view. Will definitely visit this place again, much of the reason here being the staff and their thoughtful and caring attitude towards the customers needs! Great job folks, keep it up and thanks one again for making our lunch fun and comfortable today üôÇ"

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Venkat Reddy,07 October 2018,4,"Was late at work, stomach was growling, like a wailing siren of an ambulance, indicating an emergency to fill it up. At this moment there was a row of places for the mind to choose from, Urban Asia it was.
Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. The service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. Was not really in the mood for the mains. One can give it a try, especially those Chinese food lovers."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Aayushi Bhandari,06 October 2018,4,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Went for a lunch buffet. The buffet was good, nothing exceptionally great. The starters were good in taste, like corn, veg manchurian, veg 65, paneer tikka. But the soup was very weird for me.
The chat section is definitely a thumbs up. Go for it!!
The dessert section had a good element of frozen ice cream, watching which being made is a treat to eyes. So, overall a good enough place."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Priyanka Paul,03 October 2018,5,"I really enjoyed the ambience. 
The lunch buffet is very tasty. try the chaat . Also mutton rogan josh is very delicious. 
Friendly staff. Went during lunch time Al-carte serving time was slow."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Subhayan Foodie Basu,30 September 2018,4,"Location: just opposite Gachibowli police station

Ambience: its beautifully decorated with both modern n urban indian styled art. Dimmed lighting.. good soothing music

Food: we went for a customised buffet as we were bunch of 25 team members and made a corporate reservation. It consisted of 4non veg n 4veg strters
3 main course and 5desserts

Its was a good place to hangout with big groups"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Sambhangi Sandeep,29 September 2018,4,"Authentic Asian food. Loved the food here. The ‚ÄúDevils Chicken‚Äù is bloody good and is equally spicy.
We also had Garlic rice and Oriental chicken.

Will come back soon."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Praveen Madipoju,28 September 2018,4,Nice food and ambiance. They have all kinds of food also the buffet for dinner. Will love to visit that place again. Very good service from the restaurant.
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Aamir Nawaz,25 September 2018,4,"I am an absolute fan of their dish ""Signature Fish in Phuket Sauce""... It's super delish and whenever I am here I have to have this fish. Also tried few other options here like ""Tofu in hot chilli"" and they are good as well.
The gachibowli place is sharing space with another restaurant which gets confusing some times.

Dishes tried: Signature Fish in Phuket Sauce, Tofu in hot chilli"""
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Naveen Sunkari,22 September 2018,2,"We took buffet and got only 3 Non veg starters - Fish Prawns and Chicken - each 1 type. Food is average, as usual, nothing special. Rs 783/- (699 + 5% GST + 7% service charge) for this buffet is very too high. Not worth. Go for some Barbeque restaurants for the same price and more options."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pranay Mahi Barnwal,21 September 2018,2,"I went there for lunch with an high expectation but i was a little disappointed with the food quality. Veg food was good but for non veg buffet was little disappointing.
Restaurant had a nice ambience.
Till this all the experience was moreover ok but at the end when the payment part came they provided a bill without GST numbers."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Food Hunters,13 September 2018,1,"Absolutely horrendous service!! We avail Zomato gold services, and we had clearly mentioned that we wanted to avail this service before entering the restaurant. We placed our order at 3 p.m and they ask us to show the Zomato Gold ID right after 3 p.m (restaurant closes at 3 p.m and kitchen at 3:15), each restaurant seems to have a different policy and we customers should know beforehand what the policy is? We had made it crystal clear that we were Zomato Gold holders and they said we could show the ID later. How is it fair that the staff asks us for the ID after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it!! We are first time users of Zomato Gold.
We had to walk out. Horrible service. Stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff. Thank you for ruining a special day!!! Why do such places have Zomato Gold partnership? Probably what they're good at, is cheating customers."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Prabhjot Sandhu,08 September 2018,3,I usually visit to this place for dining after office the variety of dishes served are good and are also tried to be kept in much authentic way .... It's quite expensive as compared to other restaurants in same service...
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Peddi Akhila,04 September 2018,1,Food is unnecessarily over priced... We've ordered very simple lunch and it was surprisingly disappointing. Crispy potato in hot garlic here means French fries with a bowl of hot garlic sauce
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Nasrin Sultana,31 August 2018,4,"Visited here for saturday lunch. To my surprise it was not overcrowed so I was relieved that i could enjoy my lunch. The ambienece is soothing and refreshing . Ideal for a dinner or lunch date or to take your family . We ordered prawns battered in beer , thai noodles , kung pao chicken, mutton shorba and fried ice cream. All of the items were delicious and the quantity for one plate is good enough for 3 ppl serving. The prawns were fresh and tasty . I loved the fried ice cream ( a must try if u visit this place) . I would like to visit again"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Debangana Tarafdar,27 August 2018,4,"Urban Asia is a goto place for good Chinese in town.

This place never disappoints when it comes to food.

Amazing lamb starters. Very well cooked.
Love their pan fried flat noodles.

Great food quality and good ambience, defines the place.

The only disappointment I‚Äôve had with this place, was with the deserts. The cheese cake, was hard, as it was served right out of the fridge.

Nevertheless, this place is still a must go to place, for Chinese lovers."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhishek Mahajan,25 August 2018,4,"They now have Kings beer from Goa. That gives them the highest star already.
Ok, now for a detailed review.

1. We had to ask twice for an order we were waiting on but will discount since it was weekend which usually is buffet n we went ala carte
2. Asked for lemon slice for water and came promptly
3. Beer was served at good temp
4. Anda Bandi fried egg rice was really good
5. Coupled with urban asia spcl chicken it was awesome
6. N then we ordered spare pork ribs. Ohh the fat was delicious on it n meat just falling of the bones

Overall verdict with Zomato gold it's A steal. Even without it, worth every buck"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhishek Bhattacharyya,22 August 2018,5,"A place to fall in love with.. The decor and ambience is the eye catcher..
Variety of dishes with a good taste and price is worth to spend.."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhishek Mandal,20 August 2018,4,"Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rahul Baid,17 August 2018,4,"Their portion sizes are good for 2-3 people for most of their dishes unlike what your server would suggest. Probably he has seen a different sample size :) But this is a nice Chinese place serving both buffet and a la carte. Do try their Ginger Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Noodles. Again, I stand guilty for viewing and commenting on the menu from a vegetarian standpoint but do try their spring rolls too :)"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Frq96331,15 August 2018,2,"Completely disappointed. The staff was clearly reluctant to work.
The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.
We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.
Thoroughly disappointing.
Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ankit Jain,13 August 2018,4,"A must visit place for their exquisite Asian cuisine ,not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes !

The ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth. One does start feeling the aura of fine dine - for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example.

We ordered vegetable chilli sticks ,salt and pepper chicken as starters .
Vegetable chilli sticks (1st pic) is a must for all vegetarians here ,if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best Chinese dish I ever ordered (5/5)

Salt and pepper chicken was good - as told by my accompanying friend . I found the texture good ! He rates it (4/5)

For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .

Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! A must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)

Button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)

I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)

Final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Joyita Bhattacharya,12 August 2018,3,"I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again."
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Gauthami,10 August 2018,2,"We went to urban Asia for lunch around 1 30 on a Sunday for ala carte and I certainly would not recommend it for anyone. Though the food was good, the service was pathetic. We were ignored for more than half an hour despite calling for the waiters multiple times. We were not even given the speciality menus despite specifically asking for it.

Overall food
Roasted chilli and basil chicken:3.5/5
Kungpow chicken: 3/5
Fried garlic fried rice: 5/5
Sushi platter:4.5/5

Ambience: 3.5/5

Service: 0/5

Value for money: 2.5/5"
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Soumosri Pal,06 August 2018,4,"#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.

Well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. The food here is an absolute delight. When they say PAN ASIAN , they mean PAN ASIAN . The experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that I was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. And I would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the ORANGE CHICKEN.

Food( 4/5)

The food here is an absolute delight. No chance is left for any complaint. Good to mention, both the time I have tried ala carte and not the buffet.

Starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil Chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. The spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a Chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.
The aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. Fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.

The sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.

Amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the ORANGE CHICKEN , which is a must must try here. This dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. This I believe is the most innovative pan Asian dish which I haven't had in a long time. I call this an innovative dish because no other pan Asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.

Service (4/5)

I believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. Here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. Kudos to the staff.

Ambiance ( 4/5)

As urban Asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their Indian counterpart as it was a Saturday night and quite late . The interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural India in it's decor which I guess is a perfect combination for the Indian restaurant.

Eat India Company,Santosh Pappachan,11 May 2019,3,"This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that's about it.

Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all. The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.

I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.

It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though."
Eat India Company,Sai Prasanth Nandagiri,08 May 2019,2,"Have been to lunch with friends here today, first things, ambiance seems to be pretty good, i think people just carried on ambiance for this location. Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. All in All pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. Not a wide range of dishes. Taste not so great especially with mock tails. Totally disappointed"
Eat India Company,Mounika,04 May 2019,3,"Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with."
Eat India Company,Nishtha Chandarana,01 May 2019,2,"Instagram | veganyums_
Drop in to this place with my partner for lunch,.They have zomato gold 1+1 food offer.. Ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..
In starter, we ordered Kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..
In main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneer
Which was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in taste

My experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish.."
Eat India Company,Naimish Chandarana,27 April 2019,2,"Instagram | veganyums_

Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.

When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.

After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill."
Eat India Company,Sravanmalla65,26 April 2019,5,"Best one to try for, had Ala-Carte and starters were too good with decent quantity and good taste. Prawns and Fish items are must try here which anyone would fall in love with. Looking forward to try Buffet too"
Eat India Company,Nayan Yalamanchi,23 April 2019,4,It was a good experience. Could improve on the quality of the starters! The prawns were amazing and the main course was good too. Could‚Äôve been better if they changed the menu of the desserts
Eat India Company,DNiharikaa,21 April 2019,3,"Ok-ish food and price and taste doesn‚Äôt tally.

Ok-ish ambience

Not so great place to sit and have a chat, as it also combines with Tiki Shack and Urban Asia under one roof you felt that I was sitting in some crowded place"
Eat India Company,Jaganthini Padmanabhan,13 April 2019,1,"We had specially requested the waiter to make the paneer dish less spicy .But the dish turned out to be just the opposite .To top this we get a wrong bill to pay :).Mostly our last visit to this restaurant,neither will recommend ."

The chicken was soft, and it was delicious.

For main course we ordered zafrani Murg. This dish was again delicious. The spices were right.

I would go there again."

Eat India Company,Rohit Gupta,10 February 2019,3,"#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great."
Eat India Company,Rohit Rao,01 February 2019,4,"Eat India Company (EIC). So this is a very interesting place. You go there, and first impressions very good. When you are seated, you get 3 menu cards, 4 actually. Besides EIC, you are also given the menu of Urban Asia and Tiki Shack. It's all in one place. Now dont be surprised if you go there to have in Urban Asia and are given all three menu cards. HAHA!

Ok. So there was buffet at the EIC. I scanned thru it and they had very good options. There were number of options. Very intriguing. Though i had √Ä la cart. 

Ambience is very good. You want to go and see whats on every wall, it's interesting. Lighting is good, you get to see what you are eating (i've seen some dont have enough lighting. Not talking about Dialogue in the dark here, hehe). 

Taste was good, as in ok. I've tasted better biryanis at other places. All and all it was a good experience. Nothing like WOW or Very different. It's a good place, your regular go out and have good food."
Eat India Company,Roy Burmon,18 January 2019,5,"The place gets its name probably from EAST INDIA COMPANY and they have maintained a quite good vintage ambience in there.
Though the prices are in a bit higher end, but thats something you can expect from a brand like URBAN ASIA.

Now talking about the food, the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious. They take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.

Overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends."
Eat India Company,Apantham,15 January 2019,3,Pretty average fare.. tried the paneer lababdar and zafrani chicken .. just about fine.. the butter nan had very little butter.. service is good .. the waiters were very attentive and cheerful .. eat India company and urban Asia share the same kitchen and floor .. so one can order from either menus..they also have a buffet on the table.. however we tried the ala Carte
Eat India Company,Pratik Agarwal,13 January 2019,5,"Visited this place twice.. Love the food here and the ambience, service is also good, price is worth the experience .. its a must visit restaurant.."
Eat India Company,Srideep Bommisetti,07 January 2019,1,"Too costly and food was not up to the cost quantity also very less i will not recommend to go to this place, Crowd will be less and waiting time also little more"
Eat India Company,Abhishek Singh,21 December 2018,2,"I have been to Eat India Company twice. To Sum up my experience, I found the service Sloppy and mindless. Food has fluctuating standards here, for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines. 
The kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland.
The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.
The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.

P.S. I was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that I shall never visit this one again."
Eat India Company,Priyanka,20 December 2018,1,"No proper food. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone.
They dont even bother to come when we call them. Forget about serving us.
Very bad experience."
Eat India Company,Vishal Trivedi,18 December 2018,1,"Very bad services, I booked table in advance with zomato gold , after taking first order, they did not turned up to table to take main course order or to serve water or to clean up table. One should not come with family here."
Eat India Company,Shail Choudhary,05 December 2018,4,"We decided to go to Eat India Company for dinner, then found that it in conjunction with Urban Asia, Good for us, as we got the opportunity to try both the restaurants. Food was good so was the service, prices were moderate to high. Heard about frozen ice cream, and it was a nice try. The Place is located on the busy foodie street of Gachibowli, good that valet parking is there. Taste and Prices are decent with good portions."
Eat India Company,Saumye Rastogi,02 December 2018,2,"We visited a day before diwali and we were deploy disappointed.
Service was poor except for one server who was courteous and smiling.
We ordered fresh lime soda which was not sour
Starter were okay (hence 2 star). But main course was pathetic. We still couldn‚Äôt figure our how they screed up simple thing like paneer butter masala. Tasteless."
Eat India Company,Srinivas Atreya,01 December 2018,1,"It has absolutely nothing for vegetarians. There are a couple of starters, but that is pretty much it. Absolutely no variety either for the main course and even the deserts were disappointing.  All in all a pretty disappointing experience that felt heavy on the pocket. Hope you will start considering vegetarians and their palates too."
Eat India Company,Rahul Raj,23 November 2018,4,This place is fantastic and the ambiance has a very different concept and the service and staffs treats us as a our friends. Loved to be in this place
Eat India Company,Bhavana Ramashankar,16 November 2018,1,"We had an unhappy dinner. Really very slow service, least interested to bother or care about the customers.

Waited for 45 mins to be served cold food (almost the leftover). Lack of cleanliness."
Eat India Company,Chirag Gupta ?,07 November 2018,5,"If you are craving for some really good food and cheap drinks, this is the place to go to.

Zomato gold is applicable here on food.

The ambience is top notch and soothes you.

The menu for Urban Asia is also available here to order from.

The staff is friendly too.

Must go. 10/10"
Eat India Company,RAVI TEJA,02 November 2018,5,A nice place to have food with buddies.. We went for a team lunch and had a nice experience. The ambience and food variety are great and the music is continuous and soothing.. Overall we liked this place.. Especially the starters are well cooked and served..
Eat India Company,RAJ,01 November 2018,1,The receptionist was very impolite. She started shouting at us when we asked her to call her manager. The most amazing part was when we were told that manager was very busy and cannot come to us. I am not sure what was more important for the manager than customers (the restaurant was definitely not on fire). And funny business model of not catering to a group of 8 when they had 5 tables for four free.
Eat India Company,Ravi Chandra,01 November 2018,5,"Visited this place for buffet lunch with team.The Starters were very good.They will serve starters on table..Even the main course was good...Loved Phirni and Chico Lava cake as well.However, the ice cream was not good.Staff was courteous as well.."
Eat India Company,Venna Anand,27 October 2018,5,Want to eat food... Come to a place where you can eat food big time.. love life food repeat... In love with the best starters and main course......
Eat India Company,Prakrati Dangarh,25 October 2018,5,"We had a great time with awesome food and great service by SK Alauddin. I recommend Thai Coconut Soup, Malaysian Laska, Signature fish Phuket sauce"
Eat India Company,Rohith,25 October 2018,4,"#Good food#goodambiance #greatservice #pocket friendly##
This is what u need to say about this place u can call it as urban Asia or u can call it as eat India Co easy access to the place good place to hang on with friends"
Eat India Company,Rey. 07,25 October 2018,5,"Thank u eat India we had made out day outing.. We are almost fifteen people and we had enjoyed the ambiance there food and there service, food was quick as we went for a buffet and it's a good spread we got a good rate too... Love to visit this place in the night... Soonnnnnnnn.
I love there ice cream counter :-)
We will come back soon"
Eat India Company,Bharathi Katabathina,25 October 2018,1,Very very bad experience I had. Too worst serving which I never experienced in my life and they were not respecting customers in a good manner.
Eat India Company,Suresh,25 October 2018,1,"Too much of crowd and no one will attend you for quite some time. Worst experience till date. Totally waste of time visiting this place, you ll leave this place in frustration."
Eat India Company,John Pascal,25 October 2018,1,Worst service and management! Waiters will not attend you and all you have to do is wait even to get menu card. Manager's behaviour is totally rude.
Eat India Company,Rishikesh,25 October 2018,1,"One of the most irresponsible staff i have ever seem till now. The only nice thing happened that receptionist guide to the table. After that we waited for almost 10 min but no one attended us even we have called couple of attenders. After some time when we spoke to the manager, we were shocked at the rude response which made us to leave the place"
Eat India Company,Abhina,25 October 2018,1,"This place is not even worth 1 star. Nobody's even attended us for more than 5 min, no courtesy of giving menu card even. When we spoke the same to manager, he himself is rude telling that it will take 5 to 10 min for the waiter's to attend. Rude manager and worst service!! Absolute no, if you are seeking to dine in peace!"
Eat India Company,Bharghav S,19 October 2018,5,"Had a great time with my friend at Eat India company last Night, along with good food & superb service too.. Thanks to Srikanth the Tall guys who take good care of us !!!highlight of the evening is Murgh Angara and Thai chicken !!
And not to forget the man who leading from the front Mr Nishant thanks to him for his suggestion to go with buffet.... Love the combination of urban asia &Eat India...
Surely we will visit soon..."
Eat India Company,Vikas Kumar,18 October 2018,1,"1. Service is too slow.
2. Chef does not check the dish and throw to customers. Worst quality for vegetarian food (Paneer dish) . Better to have road side in 100 Rs.
3. Spoiled my evening."
Eat India Company,Shruty Bagde,15 October 2018,1,"Well, it seems that they are juggling all the 3 restaurants the owner own. We were given 3 different menu cards, one for appetisers, one for main course and one for Asian cuisine. The service was too slow. We asked for paneer Kadhai instead they served us with Sauf filled Kadhai of paneer which tasted pathetic. The Zomato gold benefits were denied as the Asian cuisine menu was from the other restaurant of the same owner which was not told to us before we ordered. I missed my outstation bus because of this silly confusion of the management. Overall not a place to go if you want some peace of mind and good food."
Eat India Company,Vikram Kapur,14 October 2018,5,"Had a good time in Eat India! Along with great food the service was excellent as well! Shout out to SK Allaudin who took great care. The Irani fish was a new discovery, and was soft, and tasty.
the biryani is an all time favourite."
Eat India Company,Khushboo Gokulgandhi,14 October 2018,1,We ordered Veg Thai Coconut soup and corn squares which were a highly recommended item on the menu. Both the items turned out to be utterly disappointing. The soup smelled fishy which was not expected in a vegetarian dish. And the corn squares tasted were soggy and oily .. No crunch or crispiness. Nobody bothered to ask us about the food or why we had left the soup.
Eat India Company,Radhika Burra,14 October 2018,3,"Descent place. Nice and different Ambience. Buffet was ok ok. It started on a high note with Chicken Shorba followed by starters and main course. And as we were moving to main course taste of food was not great. It was either too much salt or garlic ginger paste.

All starters were really nice. Mutton Rogan Josh was best. Thai Green Curry with Steam Rice was delicious. Desert we're hardly available and no one even bothered to refill. Service was nice. Over all ok ok. May be second visit will think and decide if no option available."
Eat India Company,Epicure,14 October 2018,1,"Been there after seeing the rating. It is an absolute No resturant. The starters came after 30 min n we always need to remind and followup for serving and its not worth for wait as its tasteless. The drink served is like a coughsyrup with a medicinal smell. There is absolutely nothing to dine even at chinese side. Dessert section is something you will not feel to have it. You will immediately goto icecream counter where you will wait for 20-30 min and finally that fellow will state we dont have that flavour and can only give butterscotch. Its not that it got over by the time ur turn came, it was never there and they made u wait n finally forcing u to have wht he prepared than wht u want. Finally you will end up paying such huge bucks for drinking water and go straight to office to do lunch at your own office canteen which will look so beautiful than ever before. If u dont want to have food but soend money then its a worth resturant to visit."
Eat India Company,Arpita Jain,13 October 2018,1,"Worst food ever..... Very bad taste, i will give negative rating.. no dishes were properly made.very bad experience. Just name is big but no quality and taste Maintained"
Eat India Company,Shashank Ayyala,06 October 2018,5,"If it's Dal Bukhara in hyderabad it must be Eat India Company!! The hot and tantalising dal bukhara when rolled over a garlic naan with tinge of butter spread is an orgasmic treat to the tongue!!
While the other items were good, bukhara was the show stopper !!! Missing bukhara in EIC is a big miss! You may rather order just Bukhara dal and your palette has had its share of joy and would not ask for more !!!"
Eat India Company,Rahul Otreja,02 October 2018,3,Good ambience but average vegetarian food....it was just like any other restaurant....we order paneer tikka and nawabi handi....tikka was fine but handi was very average...
Eat India Company,Bhupesh Athnoorker,02 October 2018,4,"Been here for Sunday dinner buffet. I liked the ambiance with lite music.very peaceful place. Good for families who like to spend with their loved ones. and about food I liked cube corn in veg and fish, chicken & prawns in NV. I loved the mutton curry, it was so tender and delicious. And other items were ok. One thing they need to improve is service, though we opted for buffet they were serving starters at table that too with damn slow service and with repeated reminders.
Ambiance 4/5
Food 4/5
Service 2.5/5
One word review: Can try once."
Eat India Company,Ashish,02 October 2018,4,"Lovely decor, straight out of an Asian Paints Royale demo house.
Ceilings were littered with enamel painted doors and the pillars with utensils.
Absolute cracker of a place.
Repeat visit is a must."
Eat India Company,Amardeep Dabass,01 October 2018,4,"We went there yesterday for a late lunch. Google showed their closing time and we were going to reach at 3.15, so we called to confirm and they were ok. We ordered a la carte. Though the food was good, it arrived in pieces. For eg the noodles came first and the gravy came only only half the noodles were finished. The server too looked bit tired indicating it was end of his shift. The Virgin Mojito lacked the freshness and felt like fresh lime. 4.5 star for food, 3 star for service."
Eat India Company,K Gourav,29 September 2018,1,"Pathethic service and bad quality of food. Its hard to give any particular recommendations for this place since neither the ambience, the food or service is good anyway.

Disappointed."
Eat India Company,Sruj!,25 September 2018,3,"Been here for lunch and opted for ala carte..

Must trys - corn cubes
Turn offs - extremely slow service, desserts

FOOD - 3.5/5 - tried corn cubes, crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce, paneer lababdar, mint and lemon Ice cream.

Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.

Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..

SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order. This definitely has to be improvised."
Eat India Company,Aarti Passi,24 September 2018,3,"Decent Ambience with light music. Taste of food - Not that great, No much Varieties in buffet. In all, it is not worth the money spent.
They really need to keep more varieties.
No salads.
only 3 desserts including ice cream.
So, it was an average experience"
Eat India Company,Sachin Varshney,22 September 2018,4,"On my special day (BDay), I had been there. Overall it was a great dining experience. Courteous staff was the strong point here. We took a special dinner buffet. 4/5 starters served was delicious. Less option in main course and dessert though. Would like to visit here again. :)"
Eat India Company,Trisha Chakraborty,20 September 2018,4,Late review. Ambiance is good(theme : ancient India with various stuffs). I forget the name of the dishes and mocktails (most probably 1 chicken and 1 mutton dishes (main course)). Main course was good. I preferred chicken dish.
Eat India Company,Adheeth Hundi,16 September 2018,3,"Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!
But the restaurant has disappointed.
1. Ambience and service was great.
2. We went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. Common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. Well none o them weren't good as having them twice.
3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.
4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.

Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one."
Eat India Company,Ankit Mohanty,15 September 2018,2,This place served the worst Indian food I could ever ask for in Hyderabad. The towels were dirty and not properly washed. The food was just horrible. Loud music from the pub above will spoil your dining experience even more and when I asked for outdoor seating they lied saying it's only a smokin' area. Not visiting this place ever again. An extra star only coz of the interior otherwise this place is just worthy of a 1 star.
Eat India Company,Debangana Tarafdar,13 September 2018,3,"Eat India Company is attached to Urban Asia.
We tried out their buffet.
Food was decent. Liked the starters, and the main course menu. Thai green curry was impressive.
Service was a little slow.
I would have liked more variation in deserts.
Nonetheless, a decent meal."
Eat India Company,SHYAM HANSALIA,13 September 2018,2,So so place. You can visit there if you have zomato gold. Otherwise place does not deserve a special visit. Location is good and food is average.
Eat India Company,Varun MotawalA,13 September 2018,1,"Pathetic!!! A group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. Half of us were seated close to the glass facing the Gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place."
Eat India Company,Sriram Sumaithangi,12 September 2018,1,"Horrible place
Nothing for vegetarians
Service is awful
Paneer was not properly cooked
Corn cubes were hopeless
We had to wait for an hour to get vegetarian starters
The main course for vegetarian dishes was empty"
Eat India Company,Bhavik Parikh,10 September 2018,3,"Had been here on my birthday and opted for unlimited dinner and have to say till then my birthday was going great because the food was real disappointment including soup, starters, main course and dessert."
Eat India Company,Vedant Killa,09 September 2018,3,"A group of 4, we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening. The location is quite on the main road, however, the parking and the entry is terrible. They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn-off.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. üòç

Coming to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.

The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. üòë

The price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. üòÖüòÖ It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!

Overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again."
Eat India Company,Bukka Shesha Kiran,07 September 2018,5,"Good selection of dishes in the menu.The best thing about this place is it's ambience and serving.

Dambaru the steward who has given the service to the best. 

Thanks to the team who have organized really good.
Not but the least the brownies was to yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy


We enjoyed a lot :)"
Eat India Company,Khushi Singh,07 September 2018,4,"I went in for a late night dinner after work. I was happy with the service provided. Best part about this place is their interior. The antique royal doors, old locks and vintage pictures hanging on the wall and ceiling added to the charm. Quality and quantity is almost worth the price. The ambiance is perfect for a peaceful sumptuous meal. I would definitely suggest this place."
Eat India Company,Amul Chittalkar,06 September 2018,5,"If you‚Äôre wondering what to do on Sunday then head to Eat India Company, Gachibowli. Eat India Company has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hyderabad since years. Now they‚Äôve opened a new branch in Gachibowli. Yay to all my office folks. Everything from the ambience to the d√©cor, to the music is wonderful. The quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. I love love love Indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you‚Äôre a meat lover. Everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!

On Sundays, the branch at Gachibowli teams up with Urban Asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. Urban Asia is another brilliant kitchen for Asian food. If you love Chinese and Indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. They have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. Apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when I went. All this at 888 per person only. What a steal deal. My favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the Dal Bukhara [for those of you who don‚Äôt know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].

Make sure to book your table in advance. Another good tip in case you‚Äôre someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it‚Äôs usually not crowded at that time. Let me know how you like it! Thank me later."
Eat India Company,Avin Seth,02 September 2018,5,"A family dine in place great ambiane tasty food ü•ò nice view and awesome ambiance. The place has an ancient indian look with old locks, supari cutters, old doors on walls and ceiling are amazing. Its a lovely experience.

Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Eat India Company,Yum Yum YUMMY !,01 September 2018,4,"This place has two restaurants in it. One is Urban Aisa, and ankther one is ETC. Ambience and entrance was good . Food quality and presentation was too good. Ordered chicken , and mutton biryani here . Taste was good , not awesome. Will visit again ‚úåÔ∏è

Eat India Company,Shivam Shrivastava,01 September 2018,4,"Just love this place. If you are looking for proper north indian place then this is the place. Zomato Gold takes you to different places and this was one of them. Tried Paneer butter masala, butter chicken, dal makhani along with breads and pulav. Definitely worth a visit."
Eat India Company,Ash Dal,29 August 2018,2,"Visited this place for the good experience we hd earlier at their jubilee hills outlet but at yachi bolu it was a disappointing experience.Purina chutney was sour , methi chicken was bitter. Don't think will visit again. Attitude of service staff was ok."
Eat India Company,Sakshi Singh,29 August 2018,4,"We went here to celebrate a Friend‚Äôs birthday dinner ...
The staffs , service ,interiors and ambience was really great...

Coming to food, it was something ...
We all really did enjoy ...
Although the food preparation time was bit more than we expected...
But overall its a must visit place if you wanna hangout with either your office colleagues, friends or family ...

Regards,
Sakshi"
Eat India Company,Raghu Kakkunoori,27 August 2018,3,"The best thing about this place is it's aimbence. Food was good, would have been better for it's price. Gachibowli branch is clubbed with urban aisa. Zomato gold customers can take advantage of it.

Aimbence: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 3.5"
Eat India Company,Akshay Krishna,24 August 2018,3,"It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn‚Äôt expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure.

So it‚Äôs a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.

I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.

So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. It was amazing.
The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can‚Äôt complain much. They didn‚Äôt give us fish even after we asked for it.

Staff: attentive and service was okay.

Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.

Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.

Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn‚Äôt wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.

Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.

Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn‚Äôt want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it‚Äôs his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.

Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.

If those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely."
Eat India Company,Charan Thota,22 August 2018,5,Great place and wonderful service by Dilip! We ordered a fist starter and a biryani. Fish was very good. Loved the place! Will visit again for sure
Eat India Company,Mahima Sharma,21 August 2018,5,Good food. Amazing service. Decent enough prices. Paneer lababdaar and palak paneer are a must try. This outlet (Gachibowli) provides you more options since you also can order food from Urban asia menu. Overall a good experience.
Eat India Company,Kumar Raja,18 August 2018,1,Service is very slow. We waited for 30 min for the non veg starter and ended up having lots of time soda and left.. the dishes had very least salt. The chat was bitter.
Eat India Company,IndraJeet Ghorpade,17 August 2018,2,"The whole place was vibrating because of the loud music from the club above, completely spoiled the ambiance. The food wasn‚Äôt great either. The atta rumali roti was kachcha. Butter chicken lacked proper thickness. The biryani at jubilee is way way way better. Wouldn‚Äôt visit again. Especially when there‚Äôs a better alternative in the city.

The service was very good. No complains about the service. Very well trained staff."
Eat India Company,Aditi Gupta,17 August 2018,3,"Ambiance (3/5): 
Decent place for family get together. Comfortable seating arrangement, boring music. 

Food(4.5/5):
The quantity and quality of dishes served are exceptionally great. 

Service(2/5):
Service was extremely slow. Starting from menu to finger bowls to bill we kept calling the waiter and waited for ~10 min after every order. 
I was under the impression that after GST service charges are removed but i was charged additional ~10% service tax. 
Also AXIS bank offer as mentioned on Zomato site was not given by restaurant."
Eat India Company,Smit Verma,12 August 2018,5,"Food is delicious.Even service is good.SK allauddin served very well. We ordered
1. Chicken Sholay
2. Paneer lababdar
3. Peas pulao
4. Tandoori roti and butter naan"
Eat India Company,Jaldeep Vasavada,11 August 2018,1,"Urban asia and eat india company are in the same premises. Stale food, slow service, oily food. Water dripping from AC vents on tables and food items. Really bad experience."
Eat India Company,Ravindra Babu Gompa,10 August 2018,5,"Enjoyed the lunch buffet, had multiple varieties of starters. Tasted like awesome. There are many variables in main course as well. Desserts are less in number but should be fine. The final ice cream mix was just sumptuous !!"
Eat India Company,Sanjaya.bihari,08 August 2018,2,"Food is good, but service is pathetic. Had keep asking for starters, but they couldn‚Äôt serve all the items at least once. Finally we gave off"

Surely would like to come again!"
Eat India Company,Susmitha Reddy,04 August 2018,5,Had a greater time.. Great ambience coupled with delicious food...!!! Service was awesome..Thanks to S K allauddin.. Continue the sameüòä cheers!! üëç
Labonel,Ruby Mathews,21 May 2019,4,"Let me make it simple !
Their brownies are to die for , they have a huge variety of cupcakes but my personal favourite have always been the red velvet and chocolate brownies with walnut topping."
Labonel,Arza Naveen,17 May 2019,5,"This Place has only take aways, so I have ordered Red velvet Creme Cheese cake, and the Cake taste is lip smacking and everyone liked it. We even took a box of fresh brownies which are awfully tasty.

Only lacking thing is this place doesn't support customization of cakes. Prices are a bit high but they are worth it as the taste is good."
Labonel,Kanika Garg,02 May 2019,4,"It is one of the premium bakers in Gachibowli. Most of the items are made on order, probably 24 hours prior booking is required. I ordered a Triple chocolate cake for my husband. It was good in taste but nothing extraordinary and came with nice packing.

Overall, you can try their cakes once although it may pinch your pocket."
Labonel,Saba,02 May 2019,4,"Its a very expensive bakery not like other bakery they dont sell brownies and cupcakes in pieces they sell box of cupcakes and brownies . The brownies are amazing very tasty , they are soft and smooth . Love it ."
Labonel,Rakshith Torres,26 April 2019,4,"Okay so initially I thought it's quite expensive, especially for the brownies. But I had to try, of course. I took a risk of taking 2 boxes of assorted brownies for my friends. Well, in a nutshell, they loved it and so did I. Id not think twice about the brownies again! Cheers!"
Labonel,Sandeep Indukuri,29 March 2019,1,"This place is all about the hype. Ordered their signature cake - Classic Chocolate with hazelnuts.

Good - Top cream layer, Good number of hazelnuts.

Bad - Extremely dry, hardly any cream inside the layers.

For 2900‚Çπ it's extremely disappointing."
Labonel,Tumpa Roy,22 March 2019,1,"Customer service is Zero..
They don‚Äôt know how to behave and dude they don‚Äôt even have an extra box.
The entire store is under renovation, how do we know the cookies and cookies are freshly baked..
It‚Äôs expensive too. The least you can do is speak properly with the customers, well these people they definitely CAN‚ÄôT.
This place only has the hype!!!"
Labonel,G. Sushmitha Reddy,18 March 2019,4,"Best Brownies!

Labonel box of brownies are freaking expensive but are of good quality. Purchased a Walnut brownie box from here. Melt-in-mouth Brownies were cakey and moist inside.

PS: Zomato says this place has indoor seating but they don't have any and it disappointed us a lot. It's just a take away."
Labonel,Jay Mehta,19 February 2019,5,"got a box as a gift!

Trully Amazing brownies gotta experience it...goes really well with some good old vanilla ice cream dash of chocolate sauce or even solo"
Labonel,Mohammad Ali,11 February 2019,5,"What a amazing experience, very delicious desserts
Staff is very friendly, hurry to visit to try more treats,
Very good ambience, 10/10 for everything"
Labonel,Nishant Tiwari,31 December 2018,1,Average cakes at a very high price. Banana bread was very greasy and too sweet. Staff also not courteous. Will stick with Conc√∫ from now on.
Labonel,Sai Parithosh,26 December 2018,5,Best brownies and cupcakes in the town... That chocolatey feel you will not get anywhere else.. trust me.. I feel they are over priced.. but can spend it
Labonel,Shreya Bhandari,19 December 2018,5,"Their atmosphere is beautiful and the vibe is amazing. Tried their cupcakes. One of the best in Hyderabad, especially the red velvet cupcakes. It is a bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth it"
Labonel,Puja Agarwal,11 December 2018,5,"Chocolate cup cakes and Brownies, they were amazing. It is fine baking in it's true sense. A little high priced but then, they bake worth it!"
Labonel,Faisal Ahmed,29 November 2018,4,Very delicious cakes and brownies. Great quality. But a little expensive when compared to the size of the cake. Range is limited when you reach randomly. Variety only on order basis.
Labonel,Asraahmad22,25 November 2018,5,"Their tag line 'fine baking' describes this bakery best!
Really one of the finest bakes I have encountered so far.

The chocolate brownie are commendable, with the right balance of chocolate-iness and fudge-iness in every bite!!!
We also loved the cookies and banana loaf"
Labonel,Vedant Killa,24 November 2018,5,"A true match for Theo‚Äôs from Mumbai, one of Hyderabad‚Äôs finest bakery üò¨

The Triple Chocolate Cake is just designed and made to perfection! The cake is soft and gooey, full of chocolate and provided in amazing packaging.üòá

I‚Äôve been a regular with their brownies, they‚Äôre super light and yet so tasty! The only negative is that they come in a box of around 15 pieces as the smallest offering.

The cupcakes are a delight as well, both red velvet and chocolate. Slightly high on the price point.

Always a go-to-place for an excellent experience! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Labonel,Surabhi Gupta,20 November 2018,4,"I love the cupcakes from this place, vanilla , chocolate and redvelvet combo is awesome. Cakes are also delicious. The only thing lacking is variety."
Labonel,Shilpa Prusty,17 November 2018,1,"I ordered a pack of combo cupcakes of vanilla , chocolate and red velvet.None were upto the mark.I was attracted towards it good reviews and wanted to give it a shot .But none of the cupcakes were soft.
The icing on top tasted only sugar and the cream was stale.The cake was not spongy at all.I really don't understand how it has such high rating here.Total waste of money.My first and last visit today."
Labonel,Sudeep Sodani,13 November 2018,5,Love the cakes and the brownies. Brownies are a must try. Red velvet and chocolate cakes here make me go nom nom nom. Initially the price point may seem high but each bite redeems more than each buck spent.
Labonel,Sridhar Kumar,24 October 2018,5,"An excellent place with mind blowing taste. I can say each and every item is of high quality and it's worth the price tag. If someone is really tired of conventional desserts, it's the place for you to try something new. The taste will make you feel the fuming power of their tagline #finebaking"
Labonel,Sthiti Chakraborty,30 September 2018,4,"Nice place for desserts. Tried their red velvet cheese cake which was okayish as I am not a fan of the same anyway. And had packed a chocolate cake. The cake was really tasty and filling. It had that rich taste of chocolate and the texture of the cake was amazing. It was packed very well.
These guys are great with their quality and presentation."
Labonel,Gopal Agarwal,25 September 2018,1,"When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.

My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.

We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).

They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.

Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.
I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.

I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.

My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.

Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.

I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)

Update: I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences."
Labonel,Harshita,19 September 2018,5,"These cupcakes are so soft, fresh, chocolaty, delicious!!! They‚Äôre totally not overhyped. And their store is so pretty too. They should have one of these in BOMBAY. I can‚Äôt keep asking my friends to get them for me üòÇ"
Labonel,Deepthi,10 September 2018,2,after going through the amazing reviews I tried red velvet cupcakes. honestly it's not worth at all. the frosting on cupcake wasn't fresh. it tasted below average cake. not worth the money.
Labonel,Asmita Paul,30 August 2018,5,"Everything here is delectable to the last bit! Prices are bit on the higher side which makes it a little difficult for people on budget. However, you should definitely try their samples which is kept at the counter to satisfy your taste buds for free :D"
Labonel,Hardshock,22 August 2018,5,"I have never denied I have sweet teeth. You read that right, not tooth - teeth. I take every opportunity to indulge in sweets because it makes me happy. This bakery makes me happy.

Cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so I can share with the ""I don't like desserts that are actually sweet"" crowd. Don't be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting.

A fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you're eating ""healthy"" until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting. That's one of my top favorites.

Life is short - eat sweets. Buy them here. Be happy!"
Labonel,Sweta,14 August 2018,5,"I absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions. I make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever I am visiting my parents.
This place is pretty expensive and there‚Äôs no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it‚Äôs so worth it.
I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can‚Äôt wait to order them.
Note: they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on Sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip."
Labonel,Kanika Garg,13 August 2018,4,"I ordered a Triple chocolate cake. It is one of the premium bakers in gachibowli, most of the items are made to order, probably 24hrs prior booking is required, found only some sweet items. Good packing. Taste is good. Cost is at the higher end.

Labonel,Raksha,07 August 2018,5,"Absolutely loved the brownies from here. It's a treat to the taste buds and so so so good. Moist, soft and just perfectly made!! It's sure to lift your spirits, anytime!"
Labonel,AbstractFoodie,20 July 2018,4,"Beautiful cake with great flavors. We ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. It was really delicious, it had a slight hint of cinnamon unlike usual cakes with overwhelming flavors. It was mild and tasty. It also had some amazing unique flavors which we would love to try on our next trip to this cute place."
Labonel,Jenson Jose,04 July 2018,5,An Al time favorite..ordered classic chocolate for my wife's birthday and the taste ah..I still have it in my mouth..great work team..expensive but worth all of it
Labonel,Harish Donkena,27 June 2018,5,Splendid hospitality and arrangement...Nicest delicacies.Pleased to enjoy them at evening with delightful treatment offered.One of the best tasting cakes around the area. Their fruit cake is simply amazing. Also like the chocolate cakes. Quality is good and cakes are fresh. üòçüòãüòã my day ends with sweets #labonel
Labonel,Ashish Choudhury,30 May 2018,5,"Love their chocolate brownies and red velvet cupcakes! They are pricier than your usual Baker‚Äôs confectionery, but they are totally worth it.
No trip to Hyderabad was ever complete without a visit to Labonel back when I didn‚Äôt live here. I am so glad they‚Äôve expanded and started a branch in Gachibowli. I hope they start a delivery service soon."
Labonel,Tanushree Karan,09 May 2018,5,"Very renowned place for bakery. The cakes are very soft.
Tried red velvet brownie recently.. it's like burfi which melts in mouth. The sweetness is just perfect."
Labonel,Prarthana Dattani,28 April 2018,1,Pathetic staff and no courtesy. Gives only big cakes not slices.... Utter stupidy..not warm welcome and even doesn't offer any other options as a token of good customer service or doesn't even offer any other options. This not the way to function as a service industry.
Labonel,Neha Saraf,23 April 2018,5,"Having labonel brownies since childhood. The best after Theobroma though:P
Chocolate brownies are my favourite ‚ù§Ô∏è
Red velvet is also nice. Tried marble cake also which is decent.
The best part of Labonel is its flawless packing.
Good for gifting.üòç"
Labonel,Akanksha Wazalwar,27 March 2018,1,"Extremely rude staff at this outlet, Labonel Admin. And of course, the place is over-hyped - I've had some amazing cakes at stores that charge way lesser and have better staff. They honestly don't care about their customers. Do yourself a favour and head out to a much better cake shop (there are plenty, trust me)."
Labonel,Dr Praveen Reddy,06 March 2018,4.5,"Used to be run by an expat French Lady In Banjara Hills 
 Great thing about it is that they are maintaining the same quality even today after all these yaers
 Brwonies are legendary
 Carrot Cake is truly amazing with just the right hint of Cinnamon, not easy to get this right
Cup Cakes and Cookies are amazing too
Red Velvet Cup Cake is highly recommended"
Labonel,Pinaki Basu,20 February 2018,4,Its been long and really long that I am trying my hands on La Bonel cup cakes and specially Red Velvet cup cakes . I always go ahead and buy a box for myself and loved ones ! Red Velvet cup cakes - La Bonel u r lovely üíã
Labonel,Pingu,30 January 2018,4,My boyfriend had gotten a Cheese cake for my birthday from here as I am a big cheese cake fanatic. And to be honest I did not like it much I would prefer a cheese cake from FSM. But I love their cup cakes and red velvet cake they are tasty. I would recommend to try them but not for the Cheese cake. Four is for Cup Cake.
Labonel,Jithesh Chandra,19 January 2018,2,"I am from Mumbai, visited this place after hearing wonderful reviews, and purchased for 2450 too however I have never seen such an arrogant and non courteous staff. Hope your good baking doesn‚Äôt bring in arrogance"
Labonel,Hussain Abbas,14 January 2018,4,Always a lovely experience visiting Labonel. It's definitely one of the best patisseries in Hyderabad and every branch of it's lives upto the expectations.
Labonel,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,10 January 2018,4.5,"Picked up the box of cupcakes containing vanilla, chocolate and red velvet cupcakes and trust me, it's the best you might have ever had. Their packing is very classy firstly, adding to the elegance of those little cakes. I loved all three equally, but the smooth taste of chocolate - i can never forget that!! You won't regret gaining those calories ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Labonel,Shrav,30 December 2017,1.5,the cake i bought started smelling bad the very nxt day .. seriously??? u charge 2200/- for a cake n dats da way u make it?? n not to forget the hair strand i get from it ..!
Labonel,Jcunaht,01 December 2017,4.5,Fine baking it is! Place looks classy. It is expensive for a takeaway. Staff at the counter was not very warm. Cupcakes are good especially the chocolate ones. Only drawback is they let you buy in specific flavours and quantities and you don't get to pick and choose your favorite ones. Berry crumble loaf is one of my favorites.
Labonel,Anusha R,29 November 2017,5,"Labonel has been an old favourite for many years. Their cookies and brownies are always in high demand from anyone visiting from out of town to take away, however, would highly recommend trying some of their made to order menu items such as the fudge cake, chocolate pie and chocolate roulade."
Labonel,Sambhangi Sandeep,17 November 2017,5,"We ordered a cake for my Niece birthday.

Loved the Coco Vanilla cake. This place is so classy/ The guy on tills is very decent and friendly. Will surely come back."
Labonel,Shahu Vidhale,08 November 2017,2,"Had very high expectations from this place given the great reviews it has got. However, in my opinion it is just over-hyped! Not so great. If you have been to any Theobroma outlet in Mumbai, you will realize how this place is full of shit. The brownies are very average. Tea loaf is worse. One word - Underwhelming.

Plus, rude staff!"
Labonel,Srishti Dubey,06 November 2017,4.5,"Amazing red velvet brownie.Melts in your mouth and a must try.
cupcakes are nice but brownie is a clear winner.
Prices are a bit high.
got few boxes of cupcakes and brownie."
Labonel,Kulsoom Najaf,04 November 2017,1,"Please mention either on the menu card or on any food app that we dont serve single piece of cake, we serve only a whole cake. So that people dont waste their time coming at your outlet"
Labonel,Jaya Narang,04 November 2017,5,"One of the best bakeries in Hyderabad. I say ""One of the best"", because I am trying to find something to match it and haven't been able to. The brownies are amazing, their cakes are really good.

Lobonel doesn't bake, It makes magic. And the taste lingers!

Must-go place in Hyderabad. You can't miss it!"
Labonel,Ketaki Agharkar,03 November 2017,4.5,"Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochn√§sig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and n√§sig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as ‚Äúhochn√§sig‚Äù does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:

1.    This place is expensive.
2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.    They don‚Äôt sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.

Now coming to the gooooooood stuff‚Ä¶

Brownies:
The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that‚Äôs not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.

Chocolate Cakes:
I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.

Carrot Cake:
To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a ‚Äúfine baking‚Äù place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel‚Äôs carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.

Cheesecakes:
I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili‚Äôs are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.

Cupcakes:
Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.

Cookies:
Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm‚Ä¶

Miscellaneous:
There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.

Overall, if you don‚Äôt mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don‚Äôt give this place a miss."
Labonel,Aditi Gupta,26 October 2017,4,"#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLove

Classic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. 
One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. 

Suggestion: 
I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here. 
Why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be)."
Labonel,Aishwarya Venkat,21 October 2017,5,"Brownies, cupcakes and their blueberry cheesecake! I would give all of it a 10/10. The blueberry cheesecake is just too cheesy, that it certainly melts in your mouth."
Labonel,Uday Shankar,30 August 2017,2.5,Ordered a Vanilla Fudge cake for my wife's bday.. the cake was okayish at best.. the frost was very sweet like the ones you get in cheap ones.. the layers were soft but not something which would just melt in your mouth.. all in all the cake was not worth its price and hype.. disappointed
Labonel,Mayank Raj,06 August 2017,4.5,"Awesome cakes and cookies. Worth every penny. Good ambiance although outlet is not that big.Good service, delivery on time. Till now I have tried cakes only, will visit soon to try cup cakes and other cookies. I am searching for red velvet cake, i hope they met my expectations.Keep up the good work. :)"
Labonel,Simran Tantia,01 August 2017,4.5,Amazing ..never had so delicious brownie. Its so so soft that it just melts in ur mouth n is chocolaty. The cup cakes are also amazing. U cannot ahve a single piece here. U have to take a full box of 15 pcs whatever u take. One must must have it.
Labonel,Purbita Chakraborty,29 July 2017,4.5,"This place is fine baking indeed. Classy outlet as well, with very foreign inspired interiors.
Their chocolate chip cookie is very good (chewy and tasty).
The honey chocolate cake is a good bet for your evening snack.
The cupcakes here are my all time favorite (choclate feels better than the red velvet)
Their brownie is also one of the best in Hyderabad and is quite a good option for gifting people as well as being a recepient of such a box of delight."
Labonel,Yattapu Srinija,17 July 2017,3.5,"I have ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. Their online menu says it's their signature cake. It was the worst cake I ate till date. It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.
I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake."
Labonel,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'",16 July 2017,3.5,"Had their classic brownie cake which is served on a box. The brownies are fine, but too expensive for their taste I would say. There are other outlets with lower prices but tastier brownies."
Labonel,Rajarishi,31 May 2017,5,"I am in love with cup cakes and Labonel made it much more romantic üòÑ
The cream and the bread are just perfect and the flavours are amazing. Though I felt it a bit over priced, it didn't come to my mind as long as I was indulged in eating them. It would be great experience worth the price, you must try them.
Next target: their brownies üòÉ
The only thing I would like to be changed about this place is that, they should have menu options for the customers to eat there itself. It is such a beautifully designed place and just takeaway makes the experience unfinished."
Labonel,Raaj Prasad,22 May 2017,4.5,"One of Best Brownies that I've tasted.
Little expensive though. Look forward to visit again when next time in Hyderabad.
Very polite gentleman whom I met :)"
Labonel,Ganny V,18 May 2017,4,"There's no better place to satisfy your dessert cravings than this heavenly place, the Labonel. I love their cake measuring schemes, unlike kilos :-) one must have to forget about calories strictly when you visit this place.

My favs are brownies, red velvet, dark chocolate, white chocolte and all cup cake versions! They're so soft, melts in mouth, just so yummm in tummy:-)

Yes! They are very expensive. Almost costs a bomb !! 5500 Rs for a birthday cake but its all worth it once a while for any of your grand special occasion.. Go treat your tastebuds at Labonel üëç"
Labonel,Raviteja VVS,06 May 2017,1,Very poor store management. Ordered for an eggless cake on Friday 05th May 2017 and they confirmed my order. Before the pickup I just called them to check if the cake is ready and they simply say there is no order on my name at all. This is pure irresponsibility on the part of Labonel Gachibowli. Thank you for spoiling my day.
Labonel,Varma,01 May 2017,4,"The best tasting and expensive baking place

The brownies are top rated and even the chocolate cakes too but with a expensive tag

If you like to order a chocolate cake classic chocolate cake is the best

If you are not worried for the price tag this is a must try place"
Labonel,Varun Yelavarthy,30 April 2017,1,"I quit cakes after trying their fruit cake.The kind of cake which will make you think twice before celebrating an occasion.The cake had two ingredients ,cream and sadness.Do yourselves a favour and go to Con√ßu instead."
Labonel,Kanika Rastogi,17 April 2017,5,"I absolutely love the Red velvet cupcakes from labonel. They are the best! Although I am from Bombay, I would rate these cupcakes to be the best in the world(And trust me I try Red velvet Cupcakes & Cookies everywhere I travel!). They beat Theobroma in Bombay Hollow. 

Even their brownies, cakes are the softest most sumptuous ones ever! Must buy several boxes every time, you visit Hyderabad!"
Labonel,D.gurazada,06 April 2017,3.5,"They make the Best red velvet cake and cup cakes in Hyderabad !!
Their chocolate cake is very rich and gooey buy my first preference has always been red velvet !!
Their brownies are my husbands fav..
Their packaging and all are high end so best for gifting !!
But they don't customise the cake according to your taste.. you've got to take what they have !!
Only downside is , Its a over priced , so occasional indulgence is what I go with in order to satisfy my sweeth tooth .."
Labonel,Hemlata Hajong,26 March 2017,4,The best brownie i had till date. It's not like those regular brownies. It has a different taste and softness. I also tried their cupcakes. But nothing can beat their brownies. Very fancy packaging. Perfect to gift someone
Labonel,Piyush Bajaj,24 March 2017,5,"Absolute bliss to have a brownie or cake from here!!
Have made it a point to order cakes for all my special events from this place.. thumbs up for the quality and taste!!"
Labonel,Kunal Anand,17 March 2017,4.5,"Absolutely the best bakery in the area, hands down.

The cakes from this place are kept hidden in PGs and Quads, because they are totally worth the fight as well as arguments. Right now, when I am writing the review I am salivating remembering the taste of the brownies."
Labonel,Srinivas Prabhu Sangam,04 March 2017,5,Best place in town for Brownies. They were so good that I ended up eating an entire box by myself. I heard very good feedback on their cakes as well.
Labonel,Naresh Kodebathula,27 February 2017,5,"Have tried cup cakes from so many other places. But I haven't got the cup cakes anywhere like here.

Red velvet and Chocolate are our favourites"
Labonel,Athira Thilakan,27 February 2017,4.5,"love the blueberry cheesecake.. takes you to heaven!! complete foodgasm achieved!!! i think they should keep pastries too..
cupcakes and cookies are a must try..
min order is 10pcs
thats the only setback for people craving for a sweet tooth.. overall superbb!!"
Labonel,Christopher Mathew,27 February 2017,3.5,"One of the premium bakers in gachibowli, most of the items are made to order, probably 24hrs prior booking is required, found only few cupcakes, brownies ready, and that too it's for takeaway, can't dine in... Bought the chocolate and red velvet brownies, cost for 1kg around 800 or so... Good packing. Taste is good. But there are places which serves better brownies.
Cost is at the higher end."
Labonel,Spicy Mutton Chops,23 February 2017,4.5,"Delicious chocolate brownies... The packaging is awesome too!!
Been wanting to visit ever since I heard about the Banjara Hills branch, but somehow never got the chance to.
The price is a bit steep though, but an occasional indulgence which the product is meant for anyway, is perfectly fine. 
I'm not too good with dessert consistency and stuff, but all i can say is this is a place I would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties.
The brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist.

I will be back for the cupcakes."
Labonel,Shruthi Naidu,15 February 2017,2,"I have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on Zomato.  So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.  

Final note: Never ever  going to visit the place again. Overrated place"
Labonel,Sreejith Sreekumaran,13 February 2017,3.5,labonel has become a hotspot for premium and rich baking. the taste is amazing and makes you indulge in more. tasted red velvet cake on my friends birthday and it makes you go ummmmmm
Labonel,Ankita Shah,12 February 2017,3.5,"Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.
My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes."
Labonel,Shubham Rastogi,21 January 2017,4.5,"It is a delight for dessert lovers, slightly expensive but awesome stuff, ordered a cake for my wife from here recently and that cake is probably one of the best ones I have ever had. A must visit place!"
Labonel,Shalu,15 January 2017,4.5,We have brought cakes from labonel jubilee hills many times and it has always been great. On Christmas we tried labonel Gachibowli plum cake. The cake was very good and the dried fruits were of very good quality. Totally enjoyed the cake.
Labonel,Abhishek Mandal,13 January 2017,5,"Absolutely delighted with our overall experience. The shop had an excellent festive decoration. Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend."
Labonel,Muhammad Shoeb Ayubi,27 December 2016,2.5,"I have been to banjara hills outlet...it was so difficult to find it‚Äôs exact location...no sign or board or anything...I literally had to ask someone around...I had no idea it has been closed and I haven't been to Gachibowli outlet but anyway I wanted to write something about labonel...I don't know where it is situated at Gachibowli & I don't know about the ambience & I haven't tried there cakes yet which I had heard from many ppl that they are beautiful & tasty...anyway but I did try there cupcakes & brownies when they were still open at there old location...I must say I wasn't impressed...there are lots of praises about the cupcakes in the reviews over here but it wasn‚Äôt worth the expectation...mind u guys, I have a sweet tooth so naturally I will be having high expectations...they are bit too pricy and with that price they are giving tiny cupcakes...they were tasty, not like wow, but come on if ur keeping the price tag so high atleast increase the number of cupcakes in the box...same is the case with brownies...if they really want to attract large number of customers, they should reduce the price...I don't know how they are still surviving..."
Labonel,Supriya Subudhi,22 December 2016,4.5,"There isnt much I can say about labonel that hasnt been said already.
The bakery is just fantastic and has some of the best brownies and cupcakes you could hope for.
Red velvet brownies are really great and something different, that not every place offers.
The packaging makes for a great gift, so give it a go. Even birthday cakes can be ordered here, a little costlier than usual options but superb in terms of taste no doubt . (atleast a day before preorder)"
Labonel,Priya Mishra,19 December 2016,4.5,"Most importantly, the cake tasted like heaven. I had ordered for the classic chocolate cake as suggested by the person attending me and it was true love, especially for the people who are chocolate fanatics like me.
The ambiance is very sophisticated and the decorations are really good.
The only thing i did not like is that you just cannot wake up one day realizing you want at little bite of the amazing cake you had, as the minimum requirement for ordering a cake is 1 kg and they don't keep pastries !!"
Labonel,Sumit,15 December 2016,3,Its a made to order cake shop. We got some cupcakes and cookies from here. Cookies were nice (it had to be it costed something 650 for a box of 15). Cupcakes were just average.
Labonel,Srikanth Sriramagiri,13 December 2016,4,"The cupcakes were really good. Soft and creamy. Their cookies also felt very different and almost melted in the mouth. The only drawback is the quantity which you need to buy for an order as it's purely a takeaway restaurant. One last thing, labonel is not light on your pocket."
Labonel,Vaishnavi Prativadi Bhayankara,06 December 2016,1,"I dont know much about gachibowli branch, but banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that I have ever seen in my life..! Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..! If you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place. Worst experience..!"
Labonel,Chetana Didugu,05 December 2016,5,"SUPERLATIVE! I have been here once, and the taste hasn't left me since! I love their brownies. They are super yummy, and the texture is something I have never been able to find anywhere else yet. It is a melt in the mouth treat, just the right amount of everything in it. I also loved their assortment of cupcakes. Worth a try!"
Labonel,Krati Mathur,01 December 2016,4.5,"Updated review:
Ever since my first visit to Labonel I have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. This cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.
P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.

Previous review:
A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.
Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;P
With Suvi Kanchan"
Labonel,Sprutika Battu,14 November 2016,3.5,"These brownies literally melt in your mouth!
Red velvet and vanilla cupcakes are scrumptiousüòç
But I really wish we could sit down and eat 1/2 pieces in the bakery. Makes you think twice about going to Labonel because you have to get an entire box each time . It's nice to see that a great amount of effort is put into the packaging and presentation of Labonel's products."
Labonel,Anshita Arya,12 November 2016,4.5,The classic chocolate brownies of Labonel are like heaven! They are extremely soft and melt in your mouth. The cookies are yummy too. The interiors are very well done up and pleasing to the eye with the classic vintage decor. The only sad part is that they don't sell the brownies per piece and you need to buy an entire box.
Labonel,Sonali Hazra,07 November 2016,5,One day my husband got this yummy brownies in a exotic looking packet and I really had to google to know details about this store.Thats what Labonel is.Must say they make awesome pastries
Labonel,Prashanth Tinku,02 November 2016,4.5,"Best Bakers of Hyderabad 
The cup cakes are so tasty and pan cakes for birthdays are so delicious
choco brownies and chocolate cakes are so worth for its higher price"
Labonel,Majid Jahangir,01 November 2016,4.5,"Awesome,delicious,mouth watering  do not know what else i could say for the taste..it is a place where you have to spend more but once you taste their cake i am sure you'll forget what you paid..one of the best i had..i wish they were in another cities as i keep travelling.."
Labonel,Subhash Chandra,27 October 2016,4.5,Hands down the best cup cakes and brownies in Hyderabad. They don't compromise on quality and you can feel that in the rich flavors and amazing taste. We had even ordered a cake from their for one of our directors birthday and good did that cake fly after it was cut. Pricing is a bit on the higher side but totally worth it.
Labonel,Anvesh Chowdary,27 October 2016,4,This place stays in the best 5 bakeries in the city for chocolate cake for sure.Had ordered and picked up a 3 layer chocolate cake irrespective of pricing its tasting made everyone stun shock its truly a classic chocolate cake. The only con is pricing but worth the money for the taste. don't miss the chocolate cake.
Labonel,Eman Ali,13 October 2016,3.5,"I went to Labonel a long time ago.

There has always been a lot of hype about Labonel, especially for their cupcakes. I personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting. Second, the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which wasn't cost effective or practical at all.

However, I tried their brownies at a later point through a friend's purchase. They are quite delicious. I would definitely have more. But wouldn't go through the effort of buying a whole box."
Labonel,Asha V,03 October 2016,4.5,Seems like your in a classic movie from the 60s when you walk in. What a decor...deserts are splendid. Worth the money you pay. Ordered the classic chocolate cake. Yummmmm..
Driven Cafe,Gautam Narang,24 May 2019,4,"We went to have coffee at this place. They have such awesome ambience. Coffee was fantastic and Mushroom, Corn and Jalape√±o Pizza was out of this world. Plus you can actually book Sports Bikes and Cars from this place. And if you have the moolah can take Lamborghini for a ride. I‚Äôm going for 4/5 for this hell of a place."
Driven Cafe,Bharti Mehta,30 April 2019,3,"Driven is a bike themed cafe where you can even take bikes or luxury cars for rent

This is located in the busiest IT areas of Hyderabad. This is one of the places that is open till late night in this area.

Though the food is good here but certainly overpriced.

Their cold coffee is really good but the brownies need to be a little soft."
Driven Cafe,FoodBites,26 April 2019,3,"Best place for hangouts and chats.
Ordered capuccino - not so great and okay . Can be done better.
Chilli cheese toast - 5/5 . I liked it for its taste and cheesiness."
Driven Cafe,Vooha Reddy,26 March 2019,4,"Been there for the first time though it was for few mins i was just amazed with ambience and music,the staff was very patient and order was quick"
Driven Cafe,Abhishita Nekkanti,23 March 2019,4,"I visited here last week with my friend. The pizza was awesome along with the dessert. Pasta was fine, along with latte. The desserts are really good."
Driven Cafe,Kapil Mangtani,21 March 2019,1,"We went at 6:30 am here because we found that this place is open at this time, but we met with disappointment as there was nothing we could eat or drink as the place was just open and serving almost nothing"
Driven Cafe,Shivi Saxena,18 March 2019,4,"I am not a big fan of sports bikes, but I totally loved the place.
The interior and lightening is really soothing.
I preferred sitting on the first floor as it gave a better view of the place.
For food, we ordered a chilli garlic toast, chocolate donut with Mocha Frappe and Vanilla Frappe.

Individual Rating:
Food: (4/5) the donut was not upto the mark
Service : (5/5) It's self service, but my order was ready in like 5 minutes
Pocket Friendly : (4/5) The portion size was really small for the money they were charging
Ambiance : (4/5)

I really wanted to give this place a 4.5 star, but that cannot happen on Zomato now."
Driven Cafe,Triveni Arora,07 March 2019,5,Such a unique concept this cafe has of hiring bikes and cars and enjoying coffee along with it. Ambience is too cool and food is also nice. Really loved my visit there.
Driven Cafe,Narsi Reddy,03 March 2019,4,I went this place with a lot of expectations.i travelled 30 kms with full of curiosity and then when I reached the cafe I ordered my food and went exploring the cafe it was good with all bikes and cars surrounded by it. The theme of the cafe was too good but I waited for 30 min bcoz the top floor of cafe was under maintenance to see ambience of cafe I waited there and when I went upto there I find some intresting stuff I am satisfied with you BTW the food was some what good...!!
Driven Cafe,Bryan Rodrigues,01 March 2019,4,"Late night craving for some coffee and chocolate? Driven Cafe, be it!

Been here a zillion times and always had the same experience of great coffees and superb service.


Always had the Americano and sat outside for some nicotine and fresh air.

Walkable from Amazon (my workplace) makes it easily accessible. They are open 24 x 7"
Driven Cafe,Zainab AliKhan,28 February 2019,5,"Quirky interiors + Great food = Perfect! Must try - Coffee and brownie! This place has great interiors and it‚Äôs not just about the food here. At Driven Cafe, you can even hire cars and bikes!"
Driven Cafe,Rahul Singh,21 February 2019,4,"This is a great place to hangout, the interior is amazing done & looks fabulous. The beverages offered are really great also the pizza is awesome. Although they could add more things to the food menu that‚Äôll make it better. Overall a very much recommended."
Driven Cafe,The Food O‚ÄôClock,14 February 2019,3,"I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items."
Driven Cafe,Nairita Banerjee,14 February 2019,4,"Reviewing after a long time because this was really special.Me and my husband went on a long drive and when I suddenly had the craving to have a nice cup of coffee this place happened. The ambiance was really cozy and different.We ordered cup of tea , coffee and pizza. The best part was the heart shaped almond Choco pastry.loved the theme and concept of cars and bikes."
Driven Cafe,Ketaki Vaidya,01 February 2019,5,"A cozy,classy cafe to visit amidst the chaos at this junction.Loved the ambience...truly justifies their theme of automobiles.One would wish to own the cars they have for display,someday!!!
They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.
You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.
Value for money:5/5
Food:4.5/5
What I loved about the cafe:Ambience,theme,food
What could have been improved:Service
Recommendations:cafe latte with hazelnut,Peas and potato sandwich,double chocolate decadent,apple pie"
Driven Cafe,Subhendu Khan,26 January 2019,3,"The interior arrangement and design suits the name 'driven', many bike models along with bike related stuffs. Location wise it's placed at good and well communicated area. Coffee collections are remarkable. I have a good experience ans would suggest if you are around the place then visit once along with friends."
Driven Cafe,Anusha Sinha,23 January 2019,4,"The cafe is inside Kapil towers in financial district. Ambience is cool n chilled out. I ordered latte n veg pizza. The food is also very good.
Outside the cafe are high end cars n bikes available on rent. (Harleys n Porsche).
Worth visiting for a coffee with friends."
Driven Cafe,Mohamed Irfan A,21 January 2019,5,Perfect ambiance and the best place to hangout from mid night to all night for a person like me. Have to say the place is such that it detoxify you from stress. For bike lovers it is heaven. I usually have kettle tea here and found it really great and unique...Just Love this place
Driven Cafe,Sandeep Ankala,20 January 2019,5,"Driven cafe comes with a perfect ambience that entices any motor head.

This place is well setup in gachibowli near sheraton Hotel. Surrounded with some fancy cars and bikes with some great ambience and blood rushing coffee. Visited this place many times and tried few items on their menu.

The coffee was good and their food was okish. The walnut brownies was one of my favourites on their menu. Really good place for people to hangout and spend some time.

Service was very poor. That's the main reason for my 3üåü!"

Driven Cafe,Farhad Tarapore,29 November 2018,4,"The first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience. You have a triumph thunderbird LT on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. There's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. 
I went in early morning around 8:30. The cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). There was no one behind the counter. Asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. 

Ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. The guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but I found this to be an annoyance. I mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. 

The mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. As I paid, I got a torn note, so I gave it back (to exchange it of course). Instead the guy just took it and went away. I waited for a while, then called out. Asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. The dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.

Giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant. 

Oh, and they don't have anything non-veg."
Driven Cafe,Kulsum Begum,24 November 2018,4,"I was here with my bunch of friends a few days ago. I was in awe with this place and I guess anyone who visits here would also be, by the beautiful big toys this place has. From luxurious cars to super sexy sports bike, anything you want to rent this place has.
Coming to the food, they don‚Äôt have much variety, it‚Äôs just pizza, pasta, sandwich and desserts. We had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. Four cheese pizza- I didn‚Äôt like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. Veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. Paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, I don‚Äôt eat paneer so I can‚Äôt say that for myself. White sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.
Coming to drinks, I ordered cool blue slush and I loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.
Overall, it was a good experience for me."
Driven Cafe,Hari Shankar,12 November 2018,5,"This place is one of the coolest drive-in in financial district. IT peoples can hope for a cool hangout place around the corner,best place to catch your frenchy moments :)

Driven Cafe,SS,11 November 2018,1,"Please don‚Äôt use penne pasta in your Mac and cheese dish. We ordered cheese toast and brownie as well, but the food was not up to the mark. The ambience was good though."
Driven Cafe,Seema Iyengar,11 November 2018,3,We ordered cold coffee and capacuino. The cold coffee wasn't cold and the capacuino wasn't hot. Disappointed with the temperature of the coffees served. I would give a 4* for its ambience. Received a very small piece of chilly cheese toast. CCD serves better coffees.
Driven Cafe,Charushila Biswas,07 November 2018,2,"Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. We ordered:
‚ñ™Mint mocha - which tasted OK
‚ñ™Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
‚ñ™Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
‚ñ™coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
‚ñ™vegetarian cafe
‚ñ™good location
‚ñ™good music
‚ñ™they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. There's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.
Serve good food and bring your reputation up. Challenge accepted?"
Driven Cafe,Jaya Deep,01 November 2018,3,"First thing which strikes is the ambience and the big toys, everyone who will visit this place for sure wld be in awe of the ambience and the big toys i was in hurry and only had cappuccino and it was very good and specially 100 bucks for a cappuccino like that, bang on! But I was not impressed by the service it can surely be improved"
Driven Cafe,Bhargavi Narla,31 October 2018,4,"This place is one of the coolest drive-in in financial district. right in the front of Kapil towers. IT peoples only hope for a cool hangout place around the corner
They have pretty decent menu including iced teas frappes and various choice of leaf teas
They have many impressive sides too

Choco almond bomb for sweet tooth is a must try"
Driven Cafe,Rohit Moola,30 October 2018,4,"The ambiance is good! It can be given 4/5!

Driven Cafe,Karan Parseja,28 October 2018,2,"Overrated and Hyped!
This place is known for its rusty garage-like interiors, where you can rent some top notch automobiles. The Cafe in ""Driven Cafe"" is rather disappointing, staff isn't very friendly, nor very observant to details. They ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains. I had Mocha and Coffee Crunch, both of which were average at its best and weren't something that I would remember."
Driven Cafe,US,25 October 2018,3,"Nice ambience and helpful staff.
Pizza is also good . The quality of cheese in pizza can be slightly better I feel. Coffee even with an extra shot didn't give a strong aroma though"
Driven Cafe,Divya Reddy,19 October 2018,3,"Ambience is quite good and this place is nearby to my office. I was disappointed with the food though. Certainly , dint reach to my expectations and the blue berry cheese cake that I had in other cafe's was *wow* , but the one here was bland . The shakes were good compared to the rest that I ordered. Service was good so I would give a 4/5 . Food - 2/5 Ambience - 4/5"
Driven Cafe,Ashish,02 October 2018,3,"Driven cafe is the new age CCD.
Govthere, chill as much as you want and call for one of their low standard of coffee.
The brew isn‚Äôt great and the veg servings aren‚Äôt good enough for a meal!

The car bike game is real strong!"

Driven Cafe,Vaibhav Sharma,20 September 2018,4,"Love this place from the word go. I always wanted to visit this cafe since it's launch. Everything about this place is super cool - be it the timing, concept, ambiance or the quality of coffees and snacks served. I visited this place on a bright Sunday morning and just fell in love with the place as I got a seat right next to muscular triumph. They have great collection of cars and bikes, which even one can hire on rent. I ordered hazelnut coffee, paneer kulcha and my friend ordered some dry fruits crispy sweet croissant along with coffee. Paneer kulcha was too good and coffee was just fine. Would visit this place again soon."
Driven Cafe,Sandeep KRISHNA,17 September 2018,3,"After a lot of reco-s and solid rating everywhere, I finally tried out Driven Cafe - mainly to sample their coffee. Unfortunately, I was disappointing with the Cappuccino. Tried a 'medium' Cappuccino - which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk, and it was very underwhelming. No aroma, no kick, it was very bland and generic. Had a hard time getting through it. 
The wife tried Frappe, which was as per her taste and my daughter (who has a major sweet tooth) found her choco chip brownie nice. However, I was quite disappointed overall."
Driven Cafe,Hemanth Emadabathuni,13 September 2018,4,"Must visit place for supercars and super bike lovers. These fantastic machines will definitely enthral your looks. Coming to the ambience the environment of the place looks like you're literally sitting in a garage, between few superbikes. The blackcurrant milkshake tasted really great but the pizza didn't taste that good. If it was made a little spicy it would be great, but the chilly flakes saved it from being a total disappointment.
Can definitely give this place a try."
Driven Cafe,Piyus Sravan,13 September 2018,1,"The food was not at all good. Though the ambience was very nice and soothing to the eye, the food was just bad. We ordered chili cheese toast, chocochip brownie and chocochip cookies. Except for the cookies, nothing was good. While the brownie tasted like some kind of medicine, the toast was just too hard and very difficult to chew."
Driven Cafe,Srishti Bhardwaj | Exploring Life Tastes,10 September 2018,4,"If midnight hunger strikes you, driven cafes are the best place to rush to. Aura is compact and beautiful, and the playlist they play is quite catchy. I was really amused to visit this place last night."
Driven Cafe,Syedfarheen816,08 September 2018,3,The place is good and the ambience too but the food is expensive and lacks taste.For bike lovers it's a place to try on and just have a normal breakfast can't prefer more than that.
Driven Cafe,Karan Dadure,01 September 2018,3,"The best thing about this cafe is that it is open 24x7.
There are lot of beverage options, a few bakery options and very little food options. The ambiance is great for bike enthusiasts, but if you aren't one it is only average for you. They play really good music though.
The food is only average."
Driven Cafe,Vedant Killa,31 August 2018,4,"The ambience is quite a steal! Such interiors and those amazing cars and bikes lined up outside üòç A must visit for bikers cause they even have fancy merchandise inside.

This place being really close to our residence, we are frequent visitors. The best part is that it‚Äôs open late in the night hours. You can just have a drink and chill in the outdoor seating area. Pure bliss!

I‚Äôve tried the cafe mocha,mint mocha- strong minty flavour, hot chocolate: all equally good. The snacks are quite average and can be avoided. The chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.

Sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced.


One of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks, I must say. üòáü§òüèΩ"
Driven Cafe,Krishna Pavan,28 August 2018,5,"This place excites me everytime I go, My most fav midnight hangout place with friends. I've been a fan of this cafe not just because of the bikes, cars and badass ambience but their excellent coffes too. They serve one of the Hyderabad's best espressos along with few other cold coffees and shakes. But, there are less snacks options. My suggestion would be to increase the snacks options and adding some exotic desserts like sizzling brownies."
Driven Cafe,Vipul Chaturvedi,19 August 2018,1,"Well..
Drove for 1 hour to reach this place...
Only destination we got was disappointment...
The Mahool as we say is cold..
Staff is fRozen!
Food is Archaic..

Much better Caf√©s around in hyderabad..
This one is not one of them.."
Driven Cafe,Vinayak Modi,19 August 2018,4,Great place to spend time. Nice ambience and music. I am an automobile enthusiast and this place is really nice. Super cars and bikes on rent are parked outside. The fruit cakes and coffee flavours are also nice. Some variety of drinks are not available at timea which is a turn down. But good place to relax and sip coffee.
Driven Cafe,Tanvi Naik/ Taste.a.licious,18 August 2018,5,"What's not to love here ... The best and the most amazing combination of car/bike and coffee...
Soo you have to to visit either if u like sporty bike and luxurious cars or coffee is life for you ..
It has rustic ambience which you will fall for and service is quite fast ..."
Driven Cafe,Ishi Dewan,13 August 2018,4,"It is my late night stop when I am in need for a coffee. Have been there dozen of times. The most eye catchy thing about the cafe is the super bikes and cars parked outside. The cafe has a rustic ambiance and is decorated with bikes and posters.

I usually end up having a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate. I loved them both.

So if you are craving for a coffee in the middle of the night then this is the place to go. Not only this, they have amazing cars and bikes for rent.

So a must visit place !! üòäüòä"
Driven Cafe,AbstractFoodie,13 August 2018,3,"Nice place. Coffee is nice. Stays open till midnight which is great for people who work late night and are in need for a good coffee. We had double chocolate decadent which is ok, as we had better before. Plus it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs made fresh. Coffee was nice as it can get better."
Driven Cafe,Soumya Chatterjee,12 August 2018,4,I was really impressed with the ambience and the simple menu options available! They say rightly that simplicity attracts the most. I was able to spend some quality time here in the evening starting with coffee and ended with desert! Will definitely plan to visit again!
Driven Cafe,Bhoom,06 August 2018,5,Omg I won't forget this place forever. I usually visit this place at least once a week. All thanks to my coworker(s) who makes my visit more memorable and refreshing. This place serves decent coffees and frappes. I would give 5* for ambience and 4* for coffee and food. Being a coffee freak couldn't resist to come down to this place.
Driven Cafe,Abhishek Kumar Singh,02 August 2018,4,This is a good place to have some quick food etc and you can find all varieties and prices are also not much. Overall it‚Äôs a good place. Ambience could be better but given the nature of business it looks good.
Driven Cafe,Manish,28 July 2018,1,its
Driven Cafe,Mhicaela Martin Galang,27 July 2018,5,"The coffee was really nice. I ordered Cafe Latte with Caramel, Hazelnut, Irish and Chocolate I believe. üòÅ"
Driven Cafe,Shubhankar Chowdhury,25 July 2018,4,"Feeling hungry or want to chill with your friends... then this cafe is the final stop for your late night hunger.... if you are a car or a bike lover , you will love this place .... this place has a raw metallic look and offer luxurious cars and bike for rent ... now comes the food.... it serves a wide range of snacks and tea/coffee.... which is good in taste....."
Driven Cafe,Busa Ravikiran,23 July 2018,5,The one and only best place to chilll out with super cars and super bikes on weekends is this DRIVEN CAFE and the food is also super awesome here but lil expensive but food worth it you can drive the super cars and super bikes in this cafe by taking it for rent for some time but the place is super awesome with #SUPERCARSANDBIKES #SUPERWEEKENDS
Driven Cafe,Kathakali Chatterjee,21 July 2018,4,Two thumbs up for coffee! One of the most authentic places for coffee in Hyderabad! Tried and tasted all the flavors.... as a coffee connoisseur they made me happy!  :) A quick meeting with cheerful and smiling Ashwin Jain was a bonus..... the service was impeccable...... ultimate customer delight! Snacks could be better though.
Driven Cafe,Tarun Reddy,18 July 2018,4,"One of the second best places for. Me to have coffee in Hyderabad after Starbucks.. The ambience of the cafe is awesome with all the superbikes and super cars. The service is decent. And the its quite reasonable to spend on coffee and food. The most interesting part is about the interiors of the cafe where it is all metallic and the paintings are awesome..

Food:4/5
Ambience:5/5
Service 4/5
Value For Money:4/5"
Driven Cafe,Sana,16 July 2018,1,I ordered the Cafe Frappe. It was super diluted (read 'water' ) and tasteless! Such a disappointment!
Driven Cafe,Syed Ahmed,01 July 2018,4,"Good place to chill out , lots of space the ambience is very nice live music , menu has lots of tea and coffee options , tastes good , a little on the expensive side , varieties of coffee also displayed"
Driven Cafe,Shivam Khandelwal,29 June 2018,5,"My go to cafe for any discussion or meeting. Have been to this place more than 10 times by now, and never get disappointed.
The ambience stands out from all the nearby places, with whole garage theme. If you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! Too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. The wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. The cherry on top is their songs selection.

All the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. Although my personal favourites are Flat white and Cappuccino. The quite bites available as Paneer Kulcha is recommended as well. 

Don't forget to take good camera along with you while going here."
Driven Cafe,Shiva Chary,29 June 2018,4,"What catches your eyes could be the expensive Cars and Super Bikes (which you could rent), but once you enter inside the place - you have to flex your muscles to push the door which has a heavy chain- you get a good feeling. The place offers you some interesting food options to choose from and the garage feeling gives a huge rush. The antique furniture at places adds some uniqueness to the conversation.. must visit for quick friendly hangout.."

I love the place bcz i m diehard fan of motorcycles..nice interior nd specially the motorcycles which drives u crazyüòÅüòÅ"
Driven Cafe,Venkat Mahesh,21 June 2018,5,Awesome place to hangout around. The bikers cafe theme and the ambiance is fantastic. You can also see luxury cars around. Food is great with sandwiches and pizzas. Different varieties of coffee and milkshake are best at it part. Pricing range is pretty good and affordable.
Driven Cafe,Koushik Goud,16 June 2018,4,"A good place with a grt collection of cars n bikes.The shakes wer not bad,and the service was quick.However we end up by watching those automotives."
Driven Cafe,RAHUL RAMCHANDANI,13 June 2018,5,Wonderful place to be with friends. Recommend you to have the Caramel Mocha. Tastes wonderful. The coffee range is a very good range. Cannot be compared to Starbucks but way better than Cafe Coffee Day.
Driven Cafe,Harsh Jhunjhunwala,12 June 2018,3,"Great place to hangout and chill with friends. We just went for a drive around 12.30 and ended up here !
The ambience was pretty cool !
We tried garlic bread, with brownie and a cold coffee !
Brownie was little disappointing i would say, too sweet !
Though Coffee was pretty good !
Garlic bread was ok , it could have been little more crisp !
Will definately like to try out once more with pizzas and pasta !"
Driven Cafe,ChicLifeByte,10 June 2018,5,"If bikes, cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the Driven Cafe is no less than heaven for you. Their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous FORD-MUSTANG-5, premium PORSCHE-911 CARRERA-4S0, the Hulk of Bikes TRIUMPH-ROCKET-III, speedy SUZUKI-HAYABUSA and the kinetic KAWASAKI-ZX14R- which is also one of the world‚Äôs fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. At present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.

If this doesn‚Äôt satisfy the gearhead inside you then there‚Äôs some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!

The place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. The ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. It is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. The cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.

Coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the Chili Cheese Toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. It was quite filling and really tasty. Next up was the flavourful Apple Pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.

This was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. The ‚Äòselfie coffee‚Äô has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. This is one-of-a-kind experience. You click a selfie and Whatsapp that on a number, they‚Äôll print that particular selfie on the coffee.

Lastly we had the Turkish Baklava Twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. The place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included Colombian Coffee, Death Wish, Illy Monka, Birch Coffee, Araku Tribal Coffee, Organic Decaf Peppermint Mocha and many more.

The place is definitely a must go!

Driven Cafe,Nishu,09 June 2018,3,"Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite. Amit Agrawal Harsh Jhunjhunwala Poorvi Agarwal"
Driven Cafe,Siva Kumar,06 June 2018,4,"Well been to this place for 4 times now, the reason being it's unique ambience, peace and the opportunity nto spend quality time.

Would have given it a 5 but the place has lost a bit of it's charm recently.

Shakes are very good, my personal favorite being black currant..n the brownie is also super yummy.

The main attraction would always be the awesome interiors which this place offers.

If u have still not visited this place, book your weekend for thisüòÅ"
Driven Cafe,Sridhar Kumar,05 June 2018,4,"It's ambience is enough to drive you crazy. It's one of the best places in financial district to hangout with friends. Coffee varieties will be satisfactory but will not disappoint too. If you want to click an amazing photographs with no one around and want to relax with a cup of coffee, it's the place for you."
Driven Cafe,Sayir Ashai,04 June 2018,4,"Visited on 3rd June 18. The place is cool and the deserts served here are really nice.

I tried the Mango Pie, chocolate donut and the chilli bread and the cold coffee.

Mango pie was pretty good and the blueberry muffin was really tasty.

Frappe coffee was an average cold coffee but Chilli cheese bread was a different one.

The ambiance and the music is cool. Good place to hangout and get some nice time with friends with a cup of coffee."

Driven Cafe,Yash Paradkar,05 May 2018,4,"Great ambience and good taste. Entire place is designed with a sporty vehicular theme, and I was totally driven towards that. Also, there are sports cars which you can actually rent, if that's your intention.

This place gets more happening as the night goes, exactly opposite to Hyderabad itself :P"
Driven Cafe,Bhavya Tyagi,28 April 2018,4,"One of the best cafes I have been to. Hood ambience and good food.

Driven Cafe,Ravish Arora,25 March 2018,4,It has been my default place after my rides. Great Coffee and tea options. I personally love their floral teas (Lavender and peppermint) Food is ok. Not much options either. Also you get to check out cool superbikes and supercars and you can rest one as well.
Driven Cafe,Mt,21 March 2018,3,too sweet
Driven Cafe,Meha,18 March 2018,2,"Have to give it to the Driven Cafe for the ambience and the branding and the presentation, but the quality of food was disappointing.

A place to hangout and can have a very good coffee and hot chocolate. Oh my god! The hot chocolate is just yum in tummy.

They have a very good cars and bikes which will be given for rent.

It is definitely a very good hangout place with nice music and very good ambience."
Faasos,Kiran Thota,22 May 2019,5,"As part of tasting review, ordered masala paneer wrap, jumbo chicken wrap and sigbature rice roasted chicken, you guys rock, well balanced taste , wraps are stuffed with lots of chicken, they are juicy and soft, signature rice is well cooked, packed perfectly, served hot and quick delivered.
Check the packing you will see funny quotations in the wrap boxes, they r funny next time dont miss to read them.
Overall satisfied with the taste and service.
Will visit the store soon. All the best guys.keep going."
Faasos,Alok Kumar,19 May 2019,1,Very bad service. Waited for 1 hr 30 min but still order was not delivered. Worst experience with Faasos. No online tracking system. No to fassos ever.
Faasos,MJF Ln Sarath Babu S,17 May 2019,5,"What did I order?

I ordered Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap, Cheese Melt Chicken Wrap & Chicken Rice Feast

What was good?

Food arrived on time and was hot.
Neatly packed.
They have used reusable container for the rice and recyclable carton box(small) for the wraps
Attractive packaging.

Above all, the Taste. The products tasted real good.

I feel the cheese üßÄ on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.

Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether.

Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection. Only the ingredients differ.

My tummy is full, this noon :)"
Faasos,Shyam Tiwari,10 May 2019,5,Mohsin was really helpful in handling the situation & delivered food on time as promised. I really wanted to thank you guys for rectifying my error & resolved my issue in a professional way.
Faasos,Narendranath Reddy,29 April 2019,1,"Worst experience with Faasos. They accept orders, take money and then they don't deliver food. It's happening continuously with Faasos managed restaurants. Had a similar experience with their Ovenstory pizza as well. Till now, my money of Ovenstory pizza order is not refunded. I think my money for Faasos order is also gone."
Faasos,Kajal Verma,29 April 2019,5,The place offers amazing rolls.... If you are a foodie and eat a lot like me then trust me one roll is insufficient for you ü§£ order TWO! The Mac cheese rolls are scumptious
Faasos,Yogita Sharma,18 April 2019,1,"I ordered from faasos last night but I didn't receive my order,when I tried to connect with the restaurant they didn't respond.I tried to connecting with them many times but no one responds and after 2 hrs it shows that order is delivered.even on next day when zomato tried to call them, they didn't respond.its a wosrt service I have ever get."

Faasos,Pradeepti Sharma,14 March 2019,5,"Ordered the paneer wraps, one with the cheese, and other with a tangy masala. N a paneer rice bowl too. Paneer treat to myself. The wraps were perfectly made, with the covering prepared well, and the stuffing was mixed well with the right amount of sauces and cheese, giving a juiciness to the wrap. The rice bowl was equally yummy. With rice being cooked well, fragrant with exotic herbs and spices giving a deep ochre n shades of olive green look to the dish. Overall a nice place to order from n worth the money. Recommended üòä"

Faasos,Raagini Biswas,25 January 2019,1,"Food was delivered after 1.5 hours, when the app said it would take half that time. Faasos does not provide a number of a delivery person. The number given is a common number that is always busy. Hence the order was not possible to track.

Faasos,Kasi Raj,16 November 2018,1,I had absolutely no hesitation to say that..this is the worst biryani in d whole universe...i bet u will throw it in dustbin immediately after 1 spoon.....faasos sucks!
Faasos,Agrima Srivastava,15 November 2018,2,"Was super excited to try out the special Navratri Thali from Faasos. It had Kuttu Aata parathas, Paneer curry, Sabudana vada, and Sabudana Kheer. Honestly, my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas, as they were too greasy. Paneer curry, on the other hand, was the savior, Vadas were fine and Kheer was up to the mark. What I liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person. I am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and I couldn't finish even half of it. I have very high expectations from Fassos and am sure they will take this feedback well and improve on the quality of parathas."
Faasos,Aanchal Khemka,12 November 2018,4,"Navratri Special Thali was the one I tried this Navratri as a food tasting session.I just loved the food and the thali.

It's a must try as it was absolutely filling as well as delicious.

It was a satvik thali which means without onion and garlic used.Still had two stuff parathas made of kuttu ka aata, paneer ki sabzi, sabudana kheer.

Packing was perfect!

Highly Recommended"

Faasos,Raghava Krishna,07 November 2018,5,I have tried Chessy chicken delight and Jumbo CHicken wrap with some great flavourings into it and it was well packed with a ketctup and teeka chaska
Faasos,Vinay Singhania,06 November 2018,4,"Fasoos Navratri review program.
Ordered the Singhada aloo paratha and panner makhanwala meal.
The packaging and the presentation was very nicely done.
The singhada aloo parathas were nicely baked and tasted really good. The spices in the parathas were less but that's according to my preference.
The paneer makhanwala was creamy and tasty. It was neither too spicy nor too sweet, it had just the right taste and aroma.
Overall a good experience, definitely recommended."
Faasos,Namit Agarwal,04 November 2018,5,"I just love the wraps of Faasos and can have them at any time .I mainly like their three wraps - Cheesy corn salsa wrap,Mac n Cheese wrap and Veg pizza wrap. All of them are amazing but Pizza wrap is just mind blowing.They have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well - multigrain, crispy bake,lacha Parantha etc.

Pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person

I have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.

I have tried almost all of their major wraps :

Pizza Wrap (5/5)
Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)
Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)
Aloo wrap (3.5/5)
Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)
Egg wrap (3.5/5)
Paneer Tikka Wrap (3.5/5)
Rajma Chole is also very good.

Desserts:
I recently tried their Red Velvet cheese cake and it was also mind blowing and definitely worth a try!!It was one of the best red velvet cheese cake,I have ever had
Red velvet (5/5)
Raspberry Cheesecake shot(4.5/5)
Chocolate Fantasy (4/5)

Must try their wraps and especially Pizza wrap!!!"
Faasos,Sandhya Menon,02 November 2018,5,"I got a chance to review food from here. I ordered Jumbo chicken wrap & Jumbo veg wrap.
Food arrived on time & was packed neatly.
Food: Jumbo veg wrap was just perfectly juicy and light crisp from out.
Jumbo chicken wrap too followed the same.
Very happy with the food. Definitely a try"
Faasos,Shashank Vyas,02 November 2018,1,"Zomato has asked me to be polite.. ok.. Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality... When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - ""Food is being prepared"" , ""Your food is in the kitchen"".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal.. ( attached picture for reference )"
Faasos,Ratnadeepa Bandopadhyay,01 November 2018,1,I ordered food and they accepted it. Even after 2 hours the food was not delivered. I tried to contact them many times but no one answered. Worst behaviour ever. I had to finally cancel the order by calling the zomato customer care.
Faasos,Hungry Soul,31 October 2018,4,"Navratri review program~

I ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. The packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. The thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. It was a little expensive though but it's worth it.üòÄ Unique menus are always welcome.

I am unable to attach all the pics though coz i already reviewed the delivery once which somehow got deleted. Deserves a 4.5 üòÄ

Keep up the good work. üòÄ"
Faasos,Kamal Sardiwal,31 October 2018,2,"I received fasoos Navratri Meal. The package was neat and had arrived on time.

Parathas were excessively oily. Paneer and tomato curries tasted awful. Everything tastes candy sweet. I couldn't eat any of it apart from a bite to just taste.

The meal was a complete let down.

Thank you.

Faasos,Unsophisticated Foodies,30 October 2018,2,"Got Navratri Thali as a review meal and was highly disappointed in them.
First of all, the meal reached 3 hours late than the promised time. The items were literally swimming in oil. The food was too oily and taste mediocre. This thali needs a lot of improvement"
Faasos,HappyHunger,29 October 2018,3,"Since it was the festive season, and I wanted to try Navratri specials at Faasos. Tried their Singhada ke aloo parantha, Paneer Makhanwala, Sabudhana ki kheer, Green tomato curry and Curd. 
It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough. Not a big fan of their Navratri box.
I was disappointed with the food, though the food came in nice packaging. Very neatly packed but taste was not so neat.
Need to improve a lot."
Faasos,Harish Vangara,29 October 2018,3,"Its the festive season and I wanted to try the navrathri Thali. I tried my hand at Faasos. The Thali was well presented, the rotis were a bit hard. Sweet is average. Slightly Less sweet because of the festival. I like the paneer. And by the time the raita reached me, it was off. Bitter in taste. Overall experience neither positive nor negative."
Faasos,Enroute Deli,29 October 2018,4,"#NavratriFoodReview


Got a chance to review their Navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with Singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. Best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for Navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha üéâ The meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting! I rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli ‚ô•Ô∏è

Faasos,Anusha Reddy,29 October 2018,2,not as expected..over priced for the quantity they are giving.not worthy i ordered it for my husband..he didnt like it at all.dont want to order again
Faasos,Nishtha Chandarana,22 October 2018,3,"My actual rating is 3.5...I ordered veg wraps few days back.. Service was quick..I must say packaging was really good..

I ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer Tikka wrap. They also served tikha masala with wrap..Those who love spicy food must like this masala...

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..

Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

My experience was good..

Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more pics and food fun...."
Faasos,Prabhu Kiran Veesam,21 October 2018,4,"Very nice experience with the food from this outlet.
I ordered reshmi chicken wrap and it‚Äôs taste is really good and classic in terms of recipie.

Faasos,Vipul Mittal,19 October 2018,4,"#NavratriSpecialFoodReviewProgram

I ordered the tomato curry navratri special thali which was really good. It had 2 kuttu ata aloo paratha, 2 sabudana vadas, kheer, paneer makhanwala and tomato curry served along with curd. The tomato curry was the best of the lot. Sabudana vada was a little let down as it wasnt cooked completely. The parathas were very tasty and it was served hot. Overall the thali was very tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed everything."
Faasos,Shrish Pandey,18 October 2018,1,"One of the worst experience I had with Faasos, I placed an order for Royal chicken Rice , the order got accepted and I waited for 2 hours ,called them , asked zomato support and after make me wait for 2 hours Faasos cancelled my order."

I have ordered melt cheese paneer Frankie and chicken overload Frankie, both of them were yummy with the teeka chaska masala that comes along with the packaging.
I have received these wraps from Faasos as a part of review writing.

Faasos,Chirag Arora,11 October 2018,5,"So as part of this food tasting festival, I was sent a royal Navratri meal that had paneer makhanwala, singhada aloo paratha, hare tamatar ki sabzi and saabudana vada. It‚Äôs an absolute delight for someone who‚Äôs fasting during Navratri. Each and every dish was just yum! Even if you‚Äôre not fasting you should try this. Slightly overpriced but it‚Äôs worth trying. The paneer and paratha were the best part of the thali."
Faasos,Ashok Choudhary,11 October 2018,4,"Recently I ordered Cheese melt chicken wrap and Masala chicken tikka wrap.
Cheese melt wrap was yum and Masala wrap was also nice.
In navratri special I tried Paneer makhanwala Royal navratra meal which was packed nicely."
Faasos,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,10 October 2018,3,"#Vegetarian Review

I got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
If you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. It had right amount of spices. The cheese paneer roll was too bland. It had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.

The quantity was good enough for one. Would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

However, Do try the paneer tikka masala roll if you're craving for some snacks‚ù§Ô∏è"
Faasos,Mehakbaweja1996,10 October 2018,5,The food was excellent. I had a fast today and this kind was food was awesome . I had a stomach full meal and the experience was really well . Thank you fasoos . The paneer was really well and the rotis were very very good .
Faasos,Malika Seth,09 October 2018,1,Canceled my online order after 2 hours of waiting. No decent response from their side. And Zomato as a compensation gave 52 credits for a 2 hour long order wait. 'Sorry is all they can say'
Faasos,Swati Nandy,04 October 2018,4,I had ordered the Cheesy Chicken Bhuna Wrap and the Jumbo Chicken Wrap from here. This was by invitation only and was for tasting. The Cheesy Wrap was great and was filled with cheese in every bite. The Chicken Jumbo Wrap actually had loads of chicken with my favorite variety being the chicken meatball. This is definitely a must try and is also a part of their Signature Wraps.
Faasos,Shrikant Deo,04 October 2018,3,The one I ordered (Chicken wrap) would have been 5 star but the amount of salt you added was unbearable. Do something about it and also the rice dish was fine
Faasos,Siddhanth Sharma,30 September 2018,1,Ordered Jumbo Paneer Tikka Rice Fest. First of all it was nowhere near to being jumbo. Simply a small box and they call it ‚ÄòJumbo‚Äô. Probably they have studied English from some remote island. Secondly the rice was so damn spicy that I am facing issues in my stomach after having them. This was my first and last order from Fassos. Will never ever order again from here.
Faasos,Samiksha,26 September 2018,1,I ordered 2 aloo parathas from Faasos and it was so bad that I had to throw both the boxes away. The parathas were very oily and they smelt sour as if it was spoilt. The taste too was horrible.
Faasos,Purnima Khanna,17 September 2018,4,"One of the best rice combo available with faasos

Teekha seasoning."
Faasos,Jainit Shah,10 September 2018,1,How can I say anything good. None of my instructions given were followed. And when tried to contact they don‚Äôt reply. Zomato really needs to work with this restaurant and make sure that special instructions are followed

It was worst in fact.
Very bad experience Fasoos.

Faasos,Srishti Bhardwaj | Exploring Life Tastes,29 August 2018,4,"Ordered two wraps for dinner. They filled my appetites quite well. I really would appreciate the way packing was done, and if your tongue prefers spicy meals, you also get an option of spicy masala.
Jumbo Veg Wrap - 4.5/5 was quite delectable, it included paneer, onion, potatoes mashed masala, mayonnaise.
Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.

Edit
Ordered Navratra Royal Meal -5/5 yesterday , the quality of food was extremely delicious, packaging of fasoos has always been appreciable. The meal was suffice for two people. I look forward to ordering more and more from fasoos, I'm extremely glad with their service."
Faasos,Swathi Lekshmi,20 August 2018,1,Is BOGO offer applied to sell out substandard items in the menu? The food was too salty.

The taste will never disappoint you. Their tea is also my personal favourite.Their meat ball wraps and chicken tikka wraps are truly delicious. Ample amount of stuffing to make your tummy full. Must order if you want something quick and not so heavy on your pocket

Tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you'll be full to your throat with just one wrap. Besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy üëåüëå

1st one is ok but not great, size is huge and can give a try
2nd one is a real Delight and name is justified, loved their seasonings and quality of wrap , almost matches to Kathi roll"

Royal Spicy Restaurant,Devendar Elamarti,16 December 2018,4,"Since my childhood, I've always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when I got to know that this place serves a good Gongura Biryani, thought of having it.

And then comes a day when I finally ordered it and guess what, as soon as you see it, you'll fall in love with the colour of biryani üòç Hopefully that is not an artificial colour. But coming to taste, it's awesome. Just lyk God is omnipotent, the flavour of Gongura is omnipresentüòâ I mean in every rice grain you can sense it. The chicken pieces too were very good. They are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teethüòú could eat those easily üòÇ
Tagged at a moderate price , quantity is quite sufficient.

If you're a lover of Gongura , then this a must try.

NOTE: I don't have any idea about ambience . My rating confined to Gongura biryani alone as I haven't had anything else from there.

P.S. I still have this doubt how the chef managed to get that color to the biryani ü§îü§îü§î"

Royal Spicy Restaurant,Akash Awasthi,14 October 2018,4,I didn't try too many things from here but Chicken Dum Biryani was good. Quantity was very good if you are a single person then it is too much and for two people it's not very enough you would need to get a shake or something with it. It's not like you will be hungry but you won't be full till neck(that's how I like eating biryani). If two persons are just normal eater then it's a win-win.

The Old Madras Baking Company,HR10,19 May 2019,4,"Nestled between the hustle bustle of Gachibowli is a small cafe OMBC. One of the very few places in the city with amazing cookies and bagels. Having visited the cafe a handful of times, some of our favourites include the everything bagel, chocochip cookies, margherita pizza and the banana cake. Although the staff is sweet and accommodating, the service is a little slow at times. Sometimes we have received our pizzas before the muffins. We highly recommend this place. This place is perfect for an outing with friends or even for work meetings and offers a wide range of choice from savoury to sweets. One of our favourites in the city."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Dhanasekar Kannan,18 May 2019,Like,One of the best pizzas to try. It served with the fresh crust and the topping of veggies are fresh and the taste of the ingredients was awesome and it is fully overloaded with Cheese. I would like to recommend to try every Time I wager for pizza
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ferry Thompson,16 May 2019,4,"One of the best places to fill your stomach with. This place is a treat in case you are a sweet tooth. The food is quite good but can never be compared to the sweet delicacies. The tuna sandwich is a win if you like sea food. There are shakes here too ,which are not up to the mark comparitively."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ketki Shrivastava Bhagat,16 May 2019,1,"Absolutely pathetic. I placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake. The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk. I will, for sure, completely avoid this place."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vivek Srivastava,16 May 2019,1,"Went to this place for lunch. Ordered and paid, waited for 25 minutes and realise that order has not been placed. The place had more people serving than the people eating and yet this happened and everyone was blaming everyone else. There were flies all over the place. Poor show. Had to skip lunch because of their error"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Bikalpa Pandey,14 May 2019,1,"Zomato information is wrong, it says the place closes at 11. we reached at 10:30 and the place was closed. The staff was quite uncourteous and turned is it quite impolitely."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sai Akula,08 May 2019,2,"Have heard good things about this place. So wanted to give a try. Went in and sat, no one even approached us. Ordered a Chicken Omelette, Mushroom omelette and filter coffee. The food was decent, but the service needs to improve. Had some mosquitoes, the tables were not cleaned promptly after the guests left. The same guy who was cleaning the tables brought us coffee bare hands, wish he‚Äôd wear gloves. Hope the administration takes notice."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Basavarajeshwari,04 May 2019,5,"Oh what a lovely place. Thanks to my friend who took me here for breakfast. Both of us were super hungry. We ordered mushroom omelette with butter crossiant and scarmbled egg with butter crossiant. A jalepeno bagel with cream chees. OMG üò≤ what amazing they tasted. The best crossiant I have come across so far in India. So soft. So were the scrambles egg and mushroom omlette. The cream cheese was just amazing. We ordered Hazelnut cafe Mocha and Hazelnut capcuinno. They were just good. Thank go hazelnut syrup they used wasnt very sweet.
I was so in love with smell of bread they are baking took. banana cake , Danish pastry , Chocolate cake and brioche for my frined. Would definitely recommend if you love bread that too freshly baked. üòã"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Susobhan Mukherjee,25 April 2019,4,Been here with my friends. Good place for meeting. Food is nice. Service is slow while ordering food. They can improve the outside restaurant because when I went AC was not working. Inside is very cool and  do your official work with full concentration. But its bit noisy due to machines inside. they can think about reducing the noise.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sreetama Pal,21 April 2019,3,"Just your normal cafe, nothing out of the ordinary.

Very slow and inattentive service. Okay food. Coffee not that great.

The only thing I would think of ordering on repeat would be the spinach and mushroom pie and maybe the blueberry Danish.

Value for money could be better.

Not at all inpressive :/"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Divya Srirekha,16 April 2019,3,"A quiet and comfortable place for hanging out with friends. Their food is not that great but the service is good. We ordered simple dishes like Garlic bread, Pasta and Bagel. But everything seemed a bit dry. I was expecting a lot more from this place as it said they freshly bake all the bread items."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Chirag Gupta ?,15 April 2019,4,"This bakery is present in a prime location.
The ambience and seating are great.
But the food lacks in taste.
I tried blueberry cake and üçÑ mushroom makhni ü•™ sandwich here, neither of which was upto the mark.
Still, it's a great place to hangout with friends."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Deepti Sirdesai,14 April 2019,4,I really like this place. It has an old world charm. The bakery products are up to the mark and I would recommend their Victorian cream cake with raspberries. I love tea cakes and throughly enjoyed it. It also has really nice cold coffee and soup.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Raj Rohit,31 March 2019,5,"Wonderful cream cheese bagels.

Prompt delivery. Good quantity and great taste. The bagels are very nicely toasted and had a very generous amount of cream cheese on them.

5/5"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Bharath Maguluri,31 March 2019,4,"Went there on Saturday evening. Simple and Busy place. Tried a cake with blueberry and cheese. Portion is huge, tasted very good. All of us liked it. Also had the grilled chicken sandwich with ginger pickle. That ginger taste was good. Overall good place to have some cakes and snacks."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sakshi Garg,27 March 2019,3,"This place is located opposite to Deloitte towers, with the limited seating you will find it mostly over crowded. The ambiance has a vintage feel as soon as you enter.
I ordered Paneer chilli pizza, peach iced tea,chilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pasta...all of them were okayish.
Pizza was perfect indian pizza, tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very Desi taste to it, they put carrots in pasta which didn't go well at all.I only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection.

Price-3/5
Food-3/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-3/5"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ankita Thakur,10 March 2019,4,"Limited menu, but whatever is there, is great.
Usually crowded, takes some time to get the food to you.
Only for Coffee: 5 stars
Ambience: good(inside and outdoor seating available)"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Aanchal Khemka,05 March 2019,5,"This place is AMAZING!!!!!

I happen to have come across this bakery through few of my friends and I was blown away with the things they had to offer.

To begin with , I tried their the most famous banana cake and the cookies...trust me...I have never ever had such a yummy banana cake.

It's a must try thing here and so are the cookies...I tried dark chocolate cookies and choco chip cookies....the filling was perfect and so was the taste.

The staff was very nice and welcoming.

This place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I can't wait to try their other stuff like pizza and all"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Nikita Jain,28 February 2019,4,"Taste is good - best things to order : Banana bread ( I can eat it whole day super yum!!!!!!), muffins, pesto pasta, carrot cake.

The outdoor seating was a disappointment for lunch and yes service little slow"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sachit Anand,17 February 2019,4,"They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good. The must try items are brownies, chocochip cookies, banana bread, sandwiches, pizza etc. They sever few items which don‚Äôt really have any purpose but just to attract kids(eg: Nutella Brioche), these kind of items might dissatisfy people."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Mr. Ego,11 February 2019,4,"A ‚Äúwoody‚Äù ambience. Gives you that vintage feel. The place is mostly crowded due to the limited seating. The food here is delicious and freshly baked. We tried the danish custard and croissant. Both were too good. My personal favourite is the former. The prices are a bit high, but considering the taste and quality, I think they are a bit fairly priced. Overall, a good place to try something fresh out of the oven."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Suraj Shenoy,09 February 2019,5,"Being a pizza fan, I love to try a lot of pizzas and this was one of the best in town. The crust was perfectly baked and hit the right perfection of crust thickness for me by not being too crisp & thin. The margherita with double cheese was so yummy."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Foodkong,06 February 2019,4,"Craving for pizza in morning...

The old madras baking company to the rescue.

Thin crust crispy at the end and delicious.

Ordered spinach peppers roasted onions feta pizza.

They took care of my comments as requested.

Will surely try other toppings soon.

Thank you.

Would loved if it would hve a little more peppers in it."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Balajee Rao,03 February 2019,4,"Spent good time with family. Ordered a few things- tomato basil soup, chicken sandwich, Madras filter coffee, mushroom soup, chocolate pastry and chilli cheese toast. Everything was just perfect. Good ambience. Slightly short on options hence 4/5."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sathishchowdary Ng,28 January 2019,5,"The best place for cakes n baking food...the best breads and super thin and delicious cheeze pizzas, pastas are available here... don't miss the old style dark chocolate cake üç∞"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Anjanaa Karthik,11 January 2019,4,"I went very late to this place. Maybe post dinner time. So the kitchen was almost closed. I ordered double cheese Margherita pizza, one cheese and chilli toast and a hot chocolate. And the best was hot chocolate. It tasted like heaven on earth. It was the best. The next would be cheese and chilli toast. Very cheesy, and yunm. Pizza was normal authentic Italian. Quite bland but really good. Obviously thin crust. And the ambience was not great, but pretty good cute setting. They have an outside dine area too.
Overal 4.5."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Neha Aggarwal,10 January 2019,4,"The place is located amongst the chaos of companies and residents.
It has a nice setup to sit and relax.
They serve one of the best White sauce pasta. Hot and creamy it's a perfect thing to have. We ordered pizza also.
It was better than average though, but can be tried .
And also, they have good variety of cakes which are worth trying.
A must visit place."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Rashminaidu1992,03 January 2019,4,"Bagels ü•Ø is what I have most loved here and the pasta is great as always!! The staff is friendly and quick. Overall it is a bit expensive but if you have some free time to spend,do visit this place üòä"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Shalini M,25 December 2018,2,"Visited this highly rated place yesterday. Ordered a sandwich, brownie, and paneer puff. Everything was very average. Not likely to try again."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Srinath.seshanarayanan,19 December 2018,4,"We had the pesto pasta, paneer tikka pizza, a mocha and took a loaf of bread home. Everything we had was quite good, except the pizza which was lacking some flavor. The bread is amongst the best we have had so far. The ambiance was good, even though it gets a bit busy outside. We will busy again soon!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Asmita,18 December 2018,3,"A fine place to sit and relax on a lazy afternoon.
Food is okayish but on the expensive side.
But the cakes and pastries are not recommended."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Silpa,13 December 2018,3,A nice place in a great location.... friendly staff and tasty food... the chocolate croissant was yummmm.... we ordered a sandwich which had ginger pickle in it... pretty interesting! Parking issues and limited indoor seating when its too hot to grab a seat outside....
The Old Madras Baking Company,Amit Kurup,11 December 2018,2,"This place has decent breakfast options but the omlettes are just ordinary with not much u can praise about and yeah it comes with one bread piece. One. Not two. One!!!!

Filter coffee was decent though bitter.

You will get better omlettes anywhere else..this is hyped."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Akanksha,05 December 2018,5,"This is my all the time go to place. it is very nearby to Deloitte Towers, Deloitte G and H block, Ramky towers, Babukhan lane. Try their filter coffee and brownie. they have the best brownie i ever had. also try their other cakes and puffs. They also provide fresh breads. they both have indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement. Service is very good."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Mounika,03 December 2018,3,I personally liked the bagel with cheese and capuccino. There was some renovation work happening outdoors when we visited this place. We were disturbed by the noise and hence couldn't stay longer. Good for groups.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Souvik Patra,30 November 2018,3,"We tried the Oregano Beagle with cheese and it was heavenly there. Also, tried the All season olives and Oregano breads, they were little ok ok. Overall the place has a good seating area, but the price is high considering the potion and taste."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Siva Kanagaraj,30 November 2018,4,"Good food and ambience, loved the beach tables chairs at the non ac area. Hygienic too, gr8 place to spend times with lots of conversations with awesome coffee"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Swagata Roy,28 November 2018,5,"Undoubtedly one of the best bakeries in hyd . I tried the Banana Cake , Carrot Cake , Choco Chips Cake ,Chocolate Muffin . Love all of them . The cakes are always baked properly. Recommending this place for pound cake loversü§òüèª"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Abc098,25 November 2018,3,"The brekkies are served with some lovely soft croissants.
The eggs were decent too.

Pretty good place for breakfast delivery considering it opens early."
The Old Madras Baking Company,BOBBY REDDY PALLE,19 November 2018,5,"Beautiful set up with inside seating as well as Alfresco. Review is for a take away of Banana bread, Carrot cake, couple of varieties of bagels and Whole wheat bread. Everything is made fresh without any preservatives. They cut the bread right in front of you. Coming to packing they do not use plastic at all except to pack bread. Banana bread was amazing. Carrot cake was also good.
Packing: 5/5Taste: 5/5Quantity: 4/5Value for money: 4/5

Overall Experience: 5/5"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ashwin J,17 November 2018,4,"I am from Chennai and a big fan for old Madras baking company.... Have ordered from this place for few times...

Taste is awesome.... No complaints what so ever... It's fresh and tastes good... Only concern is the way the delivery person handles the food...

Last time the pizza arrived cold... Completely cold... Today pizza came dismantled... It was brought upside down by the delivery person...

One suggestion to management... Pls instruct the delivery team to handle the food with more care and respect... Otherwise you will lose your customers... See the photos and know it yourself"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Piyush Goyal,17 November 2018,1,"Staying in ramky towers we frequent this place quite often. Although little did we know how incredibly disrespectful the staff really is. We found a hair in an ice cube inside the iced tea, when informed the staff on the counter about it , they willingly accepted it without checking. 10 minutes later one of the staff folks comes back saying "" are you sure there is a hair "". Only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair. After quite a discussion they brought the executive chef ( who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion) eventually when one of the staff's members (nandu in the photo) asserted that he'll personally pay for it we asked for the owner's contact, who then waived off the bill. All in all sincerely disappointed with the attitude of the staff."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pavan Kanteti,15 November 2018,5,This is probably the only place in Hyderabad serving bagels. And they taste really good. A little further away from the city. But good bagels are worth the drive.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Karthik Vempa,07 November 2018,3,Small place near Meenakshi and opp. Deloitte building. Courteous staff and good food. They have outside seating as well which is decent. Overall a decent place
The Old Madras Baking Company,Surendra Pepakayala,27 October 2018,3,"They got some good baked items like bread, bagels and puff pastries etc. Other menu items were also decent. Don't order their feta cheese omellete. It is too salty. The chef should know better. Service can be improved."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Abhiram,16 October 2018,5,Amazing food. A really good variety of muffins in the menu. My favourite is the Blueberry muffin which one should definitely try. Goes light on the pockets as well. Must visit if you want to just talk and spend some quality time with your friends. Right opposite Deloitte in Gachibowli makes it easily accessible as well. Will definitely visit again.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sandeep Sinha,13 October 2018,5,I always visit this place when I want to buy a good bread. They have good variety not as pricy and tastes amazing! Today I tried their All in Bagel and Americano. Both are recommended! All in bagel is one of the best I have ever tried! Must visit place for all bread lovers.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sejal Agarwal,12 October 2018,3,"Tried their cold coffee, chilly cheese toast and bagel with cream cheese. The cheese toast and bagel were very good. The cream cheese was also great. The cold coffee was decent. Would have rated 4 but the service was disappointing. I asked for water twice, but the staff didn‚Äôt seem to care."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ashish,12 October 2018,4,"Beautiful and classy set up of a bakery with real essence of baking ingrained!

Loved the old school charm and new age tech enablement.
This place is a bliss for bread lovers.
Called for chicken sandwich and masala omelette along with filter coffee!
Filter coffee was just about perfect!
Masala omelette was good!
Breads of the sandwich were fresh and crisp!
Loved it!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Navin Singh,11 October 2018,3,I paid additional amount to add chiken to the pasta but the pasta that came had nothing.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Rohit Reddy,30 September 2018,4,"I was here at this place for lunch with my colleague. This place is quite popular among people working at Deloitte (Meenakshi), Gachibowli though it is small place
We had a chicken makhani pizza. The pizza was very good and it was made with thin crest. The ambience was also good. The bakery products in display also seemed to be fresh and delicious, though couldn't taste them. Pricing wise, it is a bit on the higher side I felt.
Overall it was a good experience here at this place and I would rate this as
Food - 4/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Shailika Nurva,27 September 2018,2,"We ordered a double Margherita Pizza and white sauce pasta. The texture of white sauce was off and it was very clumpy (the pasta was still very hot). The pizza was fine taste wise but it can't be called a Margherita pizza (had few strands of shredded basil that was dry). All the sachets of oregano seasoning expired 3 months ago, in June and when we opened the sachets there were a lot of clumps. It's okay not to give any seasoning if you don't have it but sending expired stuff is completely unacceptable. The delivery and packing was good. Wish they had paid same attention to the food."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Navrati Kapoor,26 September 2018,4,"One of the nicer places in Hyderabad whether it is for an evening cup of coffee or breakfast.

Quality & taste of beverages & food is good.
Best part is their bakes breads, bagels & other products.

A bit on the expensive side as compared to other similar coffee places, should do something about the indoor seating arrangement."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Aamir Nawaz,24 September 2018,4,"Another random but pleasant pick from Zomato for breakfast. Good place for bakery food

Dishes Tried: Breakfast with a Butter Croissant and chicken omelette

Ambiance: Pretty impressive and must try for breakfast lovers. Interiors are beautiful.

Service: Needs a bit improvement in terms of the outside sitting"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sudhir Daniel Thomas,22 September 2018,3,"Ordered Red Sauce Veg Pasta got it delivered at friends house and the taste was not that great average and the richness in the pasta was lagging .

I felt it could have been better with the gravy and sauce a Lil thick it was a but watery ...

Heard a lot from this place a bit disappointed. .. hoping to get to order again and hopefully it will be better"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Punyaslok Chaudhury,11 September 2018,4,"Ignored this restaurant for almost a year thinking that it would be a regular bakery. But now I regret.
They make amazing pizzas and so many authentic cakes. Ambiance is cool. Good place to hang out with friends and colleagues.

Must try - Smoked pizza, banana cake, carrot cake, freshly baked breads...
Don't miss the filter coffee..."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Snigdha Bhardwaj,10 September 2018,4,"Visited this place yesterday..Ambience is quite good. Ordered hazelnut coffee,peach iced tea, red sauce pasta and paneer pizza. Coffee was totally amazing..pizza was freshly baked and tasted very good...Pasta was average only.. overall a good place to hangout with friends.."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Cafe-holic!,08 September 2018,4,"This place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!

The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.

Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pratiksha Priyadarshini,01 September 2018,5,"My absolute go-to- place! This place is a blessing for me since it serves amazing coffee. Also absolutely near to my office so I can hop in whenever I want.
Ambience: Love it! Not too fancy Not too boring. Just about right !
Food and Coffee: LOOOOVEEE it! Everything you eat there is absolutely fresh! I just love the donuts, sandwiches and the coffee! I have tried almost everything on their menu and I guarantee that nothing will disappoint you.
Must try: Egg Salad Sandwich in Focaccia bread ‚ù§Ô∏è any coffee and the Nutella Brioche
Price: Affordable with a guaranteed smile when you leave
Service: Amazing staff!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vedant Killa,31 August 2018,4,"The Old Madras Baking Company. How posh does it sound and what a spectacular ambience. This place is a must try for breakfast lovers! üòé

They have really amazing bread rolls and bakery items available for purchase. I‚Äôve tried their garlic bread, the English bread, their croissants, Chocolate muffins, custard and chocolate danish, brownies: all worth it!

Over breakfast, I tried the triple cheese sandwich- found it quite average, the white sauce pasta was delicious though. I‚Äôve also tried the mushroom sandwich with other veggies: super amazing!

Although the price point is probably a little on the higher side, it‚Äôs worth a try!üôÇ"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Swarnali,28 August 2018,4,"Whenever I crave to have a good cup of coffee, this is the place i want to head to!

Their Madras coffee is soothing, refreshing and amazing!!
I tried their cappuccino, but i will go back to have the Madras coffee again probably!!

They bake their own breads, so the sandwiches are a must try!
We ordered grilled chicken sandwich and egg sandwich with focaccia bread and trust me they were mouth watering!! The stuffing was adequate, and it had the PERFECT crunch!!

Also i will vouch for their grilled chicken salad. It is loaded with chicken and veggies and are so filling!!

They also have counter with freshly baked cakes, muffins, breads and cookies!!

So, though the menu isn‚Äôt that elaborate but whatever they are offering it is quite good!!
Price wise its ok with the quality and the quantity of the stuff they are providing!
They have both indoor and outdoor seating area..so do choose according to the weather outside!!
Though the service is bit slow, you can relax by sipping a cup of coffee...chatting away or reading a book in cafe!! Right!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sravya Alamuri,19 August 2018,4,"I didn't give a 5 because I felt everything is a bit costly here.But the bagel and cream cheese is a must try,it's delicious.Bagel costed 50 bucks plus cream another 50."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Depankar Dutta,16 August 2018,4,"Loved the bakery.. they have bunch of bakery items to try along with pasta , pizza , sandwiches and soups.

Ambience and delivery time is just apt for an evening hangout place....
Things to try for sure : Carrot cake , Victoria cake , bagel and cream cheese"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Saumya Ranjan,15 August 2018,3,"The croissants served with scrambled eggs is an awesome start for the day. The scream led eggs are really nice, soft and delicious but I was disappointed by the special omelette, which is costlier than the scrambled eggs but not tastes better than that. I tried scrambled eggs , omelette and special omelette. I must say that scrambled eggs are my favourite."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Kimisha.mandhan5,11 August 2018,2,"Egg Salad and Cappuccino were good!
Chilli Garlic Cheese Toast could have more of cheese and spice added to it!
Brownie Shake required a lot of improvements!
Not that great place!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Shreyoshi Mandal,06 August 2018,4,"Visited this cafe on Sunday evening and was a little disappointed to see hardly any baked item available on display; So we stuck to their menu.
We had ordered Hot Chocolate, Apple Iced Tea, Chicken Melt Sandwich and Fizzy Lemonade.
Service is very quick and all the items freshly prepared and served in a jiffy.
The place is tad bit pricy but worth it."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Keshav Kumar Kabra,05 August 2018,1,"Very pathetic service. 37 mins and still waiting for a cup of coffee. If you are a coffee shop and you can't provide a cup of coffee in 10 mins, you should shut down..."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Noopoor Rabi,04 August 2018,5,"Your bagels reminded me of New York. Need I say more...
Never thought I would find that authentic Jewish taste outside of Israel and Big Apple ever. So a ‚ÄúBig thank you‚Äù !"
The Old Madras Baking Company,NareshPV,31 July 2018,1,worst horrible
The Old Madras Baking Company,Anjali,30 July 2018,3,Especially when you thought that this place was closed down the surprise when you find it to be open and running as efficiently and beautiful years before you immediately want to enjoy the food and so I did it was extremely delicious and lip smacking and I also recommended 20 of my friends to visit there I hope this restaurant gets more business I would like to give this place Four Stars
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pavan Madhini,30 July 2018,5,"Great breads. Been buying regularly and the consistency is amazing in the breads.
My only gripe - wish the dark chocolate cookie was equally consistent. On some days it's great, but feels stale on other days.
Fantastic place nonetheless."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Prasanth,29 July 2018,1,Ordered for egg white omlette but got regular omlette.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Shravya Gunipudi,22 July 2018,3,"I bought an assortment of bakery products from here but I have to say I've had far superior before. The pastry was alright, the cookie was too moist, the banana cake was good and the croissants were soggy.

Overall, just a one time visit."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vivani,21 July 2018,5,"We had gone to Old Madras Baking Company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there. We were out on a Saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place. It was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.

My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)

Would recommend this place to everyone for sure. I for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Samiksha Agarwal,15 July 2018,4,"It's a nice, cozy cafe and has a pleasant ambience. I tried the red velvet pastry here, decent enough I would say! Coffees at the place are also worth a try!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vasanthi Raj,15 July 2018,4,Filter Coffee Croissant cravings get satiated here. It hums with a beat synced with mine. Tasting one at a time to control calories. They have got a wide array of goodies. Custard bun banana cake Danish etc etc. Variety of cheese preserves pickles. If they can get their over the door air blowers to keep the flies away... I would have given 5*.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Prasanth,15 July 2018,4,Taste was good but the croissant became moist because it was packed along with omlette. please ensure appropriate packing.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Allan Rai,15 July 2018,5,"It's a calm place to have breakfast at, they open as early as 7am in the morning. You can see them bake fresh bread, everything is fresh here. The coffee is amazing here. A go to place for a nice start!"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sharada Potluri,14 July 2018,1,"the edd didn't have any taste, the croissant was not crispy. instead of packing both in one big box, you can use 2 small ones so that the croissant remains crispy. total waste of money for this order"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Ankit Manek,13 July 2018,1,the the chicken on the sandwich was stale and inedible . highly unprofessional from a restaurant like yours I want my money refunded
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pulkit Agrawal,08 July 2018,3,"The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor.

The coffee is quite good, with a lot of variations available. The best part is the freshly baked breads. Those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have.

Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. Almost always, I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating. More often than not, you can see flies buzzing over the tables. Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Kapilbhat,08 July 2018,4,"Go for filter coffee and sandwich especially during monsoon üòç
Prices are not too high and they also have variety of bakery items to choose from as well"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Silpa Mohanty,07 July 2018,4,"Breakfast The Old Madras Baking Company ...is really something people should be aware about...the ambience and the service would make your soul and heart happy üòÉ
Starting with veg white pasta and ending with a good cup of cold coffee...what else do u need to pamper yourself on weekends üòÉ"
The Old Madras Baking Company,Roja9412,07 July 2018,2,food not as order
The Old Madras Baking Company,Aravinda Kolla,04 July 2018,5,"Hidden away in gachibowli lies this amazing bakery! The chocolate cake is to kill for. The pastry and the bread are super soft and melts in the mouth. Apple muffin, chicken pot pie, Nutella doughnut, chocolate babka are some of my favorites. If here, do not miss out on the chocolate cake. P.S you get the best coffee too."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vyshnavi,29 June 2018,5,"Simply Wow. What a taste, concept, ambience, service. They did everything perfect. My favourite place to go when I am at office and crave for some food. After this, I really want to visit chennai once."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Epicurean Tales,28 June 2018,4,"This place is located near the HDFC Bank inside the Meenakshi Bamboos Commercial complex in the Gachibowli area. I went there along with a friend as I read great reviews about their Doughnuts and Cakes.

My First impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas, both indoor and outdoor. We went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.

We tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and I liked most of them but my favorite are:

a) Red Velvet Doughnut [Rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.

b) Salted Nutella Doughnut [Rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with Nutella.

c) Banana Cake [Rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread.

d) Dark Chocolate Cookie [Rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.

The Old Madras Baking Company,Benazeer Khan,27 June 2018,3,"The restaurant is good, food is good. Ambience of the outdoor seating area is average. They really need to improve on the service front, it took the restaurant more than half an hour to prepare a coffee and a sandwich. There were no menus in the seating area. The setup is semi self service. You have to go to the counter to give the order but they will serve you at your seat."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Aarthy Vasudevan,26 June 2018,1,stale pizza
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pallavi K,23 June 2018,4,I have been here twice and both the times for breakfast.... and I must say I love what they cook. Their bakery is fresh and a pure delight. Size of sandwiches is huge. omelettes are interesting and tasty.
The Old Madras Baking Company,Mansi Sanghavi,22 June 2018,5,"I tried this places called Old Madras Baking Company and was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and quality of food. Ordered a mushroom sandwich which came in brown bread with a pinch of basil and tomato sauce. The filling had bell peppers and there was no extra grease which was the best part.

They bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good. There is a variety of options like bagels, custard buns, brownies and croissants. I also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds, millets and other healthy seeds. It was totally yummy!

Worth the price you pay for and for conscious eaters there's always an option here. They will customise food for you."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Humera Niyazi,19 June 2018,5,"I ate so much! Like sooo much! Because the food is yum! The interiors are good, I however Sat outside and it was beautiful and peaceful. The service is good, staff is courteous. Had the best bagel ever. Excellent experience."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Pravin Daniel,02 June 2018,4,"This is an amazing place to hang out with your friends for a coffee.. their breads are amazing as they bake fresh everyday... I have a big craving for their Spinach Corn and Cheese toast and also for their cinnamon bomb... their donuts are really good specially the salted nuttela and the Elvis donuts.... don‚Äôt ever miss their Chennai filter coffee, over all a great place and very customer friendly.. just a small let down compared to their Chennai outlets they lack few items hopefully they get back the way how it is in Chennai... a must go place in Hyderabad.."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Sudheer Maddukuri,30 May 2018,4,"Though I had very less variety of food here, I am quite impressed with their quality and taste. Really appreciate the ambience, pretty clean place. Their speciality is breads, try their bread for sure. Garlic bread is awesome here.
Very detailed menu and professional to core, they stick to basics and don't try to satisfy every cuisine."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Rishabh Wahi,27 May 2018,5,"I love this place so much that I forget clicking any pictures everytime I go there. Spinach feta cheese omelette, plain bagel with cream cheese, antipesti pesto sandwich and chicken sausage roll are some must haves. Cakes are a bit too 'bready' if that is a word."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vignan Kasibhatla,23 May 2018,5,"One definitely have to try their coconut bun and cream cheese bagels. Bread loafs are so fresh here, and we can get variety of cheese. Super place to hangout."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Kamal Prakash,22 May 2018,4,"I liked the ambience, the wooden tables looked great and I was able to take some beautiful snaps. The service was prompt. I ordered Victoria cake, red velvet brownie and chocolate croissant. The Victoria cake had a layer of cream and blueberry sauce sandwiched between two slices of sponge cake, it tasted delicious. In the croissant, the chocolate reminded me of Cadbury diary milk and red velvet brownie was good too."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Vamsi ¬Æ,22 May 2018,4,Good place for bakery food. Mutligrain cereal bread tasted good and desserts are awesome. Had Red velvet donut and Apple muffin.The cakes are little over priced but you can get for what you have paid for ..
The Old Madras Baking Company,Shalini Sarkar,17 May 2018,4,"Visited this place on a hot sultry morning. Ordered a red sauce pasta and a veg feta pizza. Both the dishes tasted good. Timely service and a good place to hangout and chill. Will surely visit this place, if i visit Hyderabad again."
The Old Madras Baking Company,Rachna (GlobalFoody),15 May 2018,4,"Great place! It's right next to my colony so it's super convenient in case I'm craving a croissant in the morning or want a lemonade after school. Great place to meet people and chill. The pasteries are great, the four cheese pizza is amendabe and the alfredo pasta is amazing. They have a wide range of milkshakes as well. Also, they allow you to bring your dog and sit outside so props. The indoor seating is kind of too bright and uncomfortable, but the outdoors smells like smoke and has many mosquitos so seating is kind of a dread when I go there. But food and service definitely makes up for it :)"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Jatin Pathak,13 April 2019,1,I liked the ambience and lighting. However their food quality needs lot of improvement especially sizzlers. They made good lasgna but they had no idea at all about how sizzler is made. Also their services are little slow.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Satya Teja,11 April 2019,4,"I was searching for a good Veg place around Gachibowli to host my daughters 1st Bday and ended up with Lime. Dinesh was the manager and he made sure the menu and other arrangements are all taken care off. Over all i was happy with the way it went except for few points to caution. 

My personal fav foods - 
- Welcome drink - Pan shots
- Starters - Yum banana tikki
- Gravys - Malai kofta
- Noodles
- Mango dal
- Chats and Chocolate gulabjamun
What is good :
- Food is great in contrast to what we generally see in party places where the hall is free
- Staff is friendly
- Their roof top gives a different experience than a regular AC hall

Things to keep in mind :
- The Mic system caused issues which spoiled the party mood. They have good mic system, please make sure its in working condition and there is AV operator in stand by through out the party
- This place is strictly for a small group. Statis crowd should not exceed 60 - 65 pax. You can enjoy the place to fullest with 50-60 pax.
- Since it is roof top, summers can be pain ful even with coolers. There is always this tension of rain ;P

With the above exceptions, i loved the place. Their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price. Their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Sravani Baru,08 April 2019,1,"Really don't go with rating. We had here in the evening and trust me food was not at all good and coming to Service, they are damn slow. 90% items in the menu are unavailable. Only available items will be served 40mins later your order. Even people were very few when we visited here. Waste of money and time"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Sagar Jain,28 March 2019,2,"You need at least 2 hrs time to get your food prepare. better go for other restaurant instead of ordering food from it.
I have ordered food from it and they either cancel or take 2 hr to just prepare your food."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Prithvi Nath,19 March 2019,5,"Sizzlers are smoking hot here. Staff are really friendly, help u in choosing a dish when in turmoil. Although it took time for them to serve, the dish was worth the wait."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Buddiga Sindhuri,13 March 2019,5,"This hotel has both accommodation and hotel downstairs.I was for 3days in this hotel the hospitality was good and suiets are costing around 3k per day.In the room they have provided all the things 24/7 hot water facility.All the decorative pieces are good here and beautiful ambience.I ate Shezwan fried rice it's good here and spicy it's costing around 225.We ate veg biryani ,garlic naan and panner tikka masala curry they are very good to taste.If you stay in this hotel breakfast is complimentary.They have provided many bf items which I could not able to those many.Coming to the breakfast in break they have provided both English and Indian breakfast.they gave milk and cornflakes ,idli ,dosa and upma.
Coming to English bf they have provided fruit bread ,wheat bread and also milk bread and you can toast them also.They gave 2 variety of cakes one pastry and other cup cake. They have also given roasted tomato along with mynassie.One more is crossient and watermelon juice and fruits.
overall ambience 5/5
food 5/5
service 5/5
one more thing this place is only for vegans not for non vegetarians."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Saurabh Gupta,23 February 2019,5,I booked The Lime for catering for a private occasion for a gathering for around 80 guests. To start with they are very professional in getting the arrangements clear to customer and provide all necessary details about the services to be provided on event day. On event day they were sharp on time and had all things well set before guests started coming in. Starters and welcome drinks were floated to the guests nicely. The main course and desserts were also pretty delicious. Overall I was extremely impressed and satisfied with the services and highly recommend it for any events.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Vyas Heera,20 February 2019,5,One of the best restaurants in gachibowli.. Goo quality.. Good quantity.. I spoke to chef vishal.. He was very good in providing the service.. Thank you.. Just one suggestion for zomato.. Why coupons codes are not available for this restaurant..?? Kindly provide offers for this restaurant..
Squeeze @ The Lime,Deepak,18 February 2019,5,"I had my daughter's birthday party last week and I am really happy with the service, food and staff. Mr. Dinesh helped a lot with Menu and other options and he arranged whatever I asked and he promised. Everyone who attend the party was very happy with all the arrangement and the service."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Nidhishourie62,12 February 2019,5,"Seven Stars to the Lime Team. Great Food, Professionally Trained Staff and passion for customer service make them best in the business. Their Outdoor Catering unit is excellent. You can simply leave your event in their hands without any worry and they will do the magic. My guests appreciated the setup, menu, food and service given by the Lime Team. Special credit to Raj and Dinesh for taking care of every single detail and making my event a success. Keep up the great job."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Gundakaram Yasaswini,30 January 2019,5,"I was at lime for buffet once. I was just really surprised to see the quality of food for the price they offered. It was amazing. That moment i decided to celebrate my son's first birthday in lime. Enquired with mr. Dinesh. Met him and decided the menu. He agreed for the changes i made. We ordered the cake too from them as i wanted a normal cake.
The birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. The starters were yummiest amongst all. Baby corn chilli garlic is the best. Bajjis were very hot and good. The highlight of the day was SIGNATURE drink from the lime. It was lemonade kind. Guests were
enjoying it alot.
We wanted no onion no garlic items in t
the menu. Dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. Elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.
One of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.
What else does a host need?
I strongly recommend lime for those who want great vegetarian food at best price. Mr sohail was available during the party and made sure every item was available till the end.
Thanks so much squeeze SQUEEZE AT THE LIME"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Tripti Maheshwari,29 January 2019,4,"One among the good pure vegetarian restaurants, ambiance is average.
Food is good quality wise. However, I have been there multiple times and have observed a deterioration in the service. Earlier they used to being finger bowl on the table, sauf in the end , even have sometimes offered some complimentary chocolates for trial. Now, despite of asking multiple times for finger bowl, they didn't gave a damn about it."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Nikhil Khosla,27 January 2019,5,"Excellent place for family get together
Very reasonable and awesome food
Staff is very friendly

Squeeze @ The Lime,Amrapalee Purkayastha,23 January 2019,5,"It was Lunch time at Office and i did not bring my lunch box. Ordered a China Combo at just 129.
Wen i got my food, i was amazed by the platter. It was so much food for just 129! and everything was yummmm. It felt like authentic chinese. Moreover all my colleagues tated the food and loved it. Great going Squeeze @ The Lime. You guys made my hectic day very pleasant.

Squeeze @ The Lime,AnuJ ShankaR,07 January 2019,2,I chose Fried Rice for my China Combo but got Noodles in return.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Naveen Rai,01 January 2019,5,"Very Good food. We had organized birthday of my kids and they arranged everything very nicely. 
Mr. Dinesh @ Lime is very helpful and has in-depth knowledge of food and he helped us to finalized a decent menu and made sure everything was done meticulously . Food was great. Our guests liked it a lot. Malai Kofta and Vilayati Veg were very good. We will definitely recommend this place for a family gathering."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Shruti Srivastava,29 December 2018,4,We had our baby's first birthday party here. The ambience was good. The food served was tasty and the quality was great. The best thing about the place is that the management goes out of it's way to make sure you are satisfied.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Megha Shukla,27 December 2018,5,"Food & presentation is superbbbbbb... We gave catering contract to lime (Mr Dinesh) for my son's bday party.

Squeeze @ The Lime,Arthi Subramanian,07 December 2018,4,I had been for a quick bday treat with my friends and it was altogether a new place not sure of how it will be.but believe me all of us enjoyed the food over there . It was amazing and worth all the money u pay. Its pure veg and being a vegeterian i thoroughly enjoyed the dishes. Ambience is decent enough. I liked it over allüòä
Squeeze @ The Lime,Akash Tripathi,06 December 2018,5,My experience with Lime is wonderful. I contacted them for my House warming function. We have 85+ odd guests. specially want to mention Mr. Dinesh name. From the day one he is actively involved in the conversation and help us to finalize the menu also. I just did the payment and remaining all the things like food timing based upon guest arrival and others are very professionally handled by Mr. Dinesh and lime folks without bothering me . Food was awesome (Despite having 85+ guest) and we got lot of positive response about food from guest and relatives also. Kudos to Mr. Dinesh and Team.
Squeeze @ The Lime,J Thakur,04 December 2018,4,"food packaging is too good. ingredients in the food were totally good. i have given it 4star because it worth the price .
taste is somewhat little less but otherwise its good
only in just 129 rs you can eat the great appetizing meal ."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Seshu Kumar,29 November 2018,4,We used catering service from Squeeze @ The Lime for our kid's Birthday at our community premises. We received compliments on food from most of our guests. The service was good and there was issue even when our guest count was more than what we estimated. We have chosen Squeeze @ The Lime for our Kid's B'Day party as we found it very good when we attended few parties at roof top banquet. It is the best place if you are planning to have a party with around 90-100 guests. I look forward for another event with Squeeze @ The Lime.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Dhiraj Agarwal,26 November 2018,5,"I recently hosted my child's birthday party on the terrace of the lime. The arrangements was really good, the service was par excellence. The ambiance of the place is awesome.A host is happy when guests are, and every guest called up to appreciate the food. Thank you, Dinesh (fnb manager) to take keen interest and making sure that the team takes an extra mile to make the event a successful one. I would really recommend lime for their quality and service"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Virag Shah,22 November 2018,5,"Nice place. Good food with lot of Jain options. Fresh ingredients and preparation. Lemon corriander soup, paneer pasanda, pasta, noodles were good. Presentation and serving are also upto the mark. Needs improvement in food delivery wait time."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Monica Reddy,17 November 2018,1,"The quality of the food is bad. The noodles, starter and the sweet, everything was drenched in heavy oil. The taste itself shows that the oil used is also of low quality. Rather than spending on the packaging of the food, they could have spent some money on providing health food."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Kapil Thakkar,04 November 2018,4,"Have been twice to this place. One of the rare places in Hyderabad, where you can have good vegetarian food. Ambiance is also good. Some of the starters have good representation."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Harry N,02 November 2018,4,"Real value for money.
One of the best places for vegetaraian buffet in and around hitech city.
Not much of rush. Good service. Decent spread. Taste is also good.
Try their buffet."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Dimple Bhatia,17 October 2018,5,"We have gone for office party

Squeeze @ The Lime,Srinivasan Rajagopalan,12 October 2018,5,"We are a regular here. Veg choices are adequate, clean ambience, excellent food quality and a no-frill price. Given our experience, we hosted a get together at home; Lime took the catering work and were extremely professional- on time, well planned, staffs had a friendly demeanor and quality of food as expected was very good. Mr. Dinesh Ramalingam is the F&B Manager who we had liaised with and kudos to him- very client centric and reassuring. Thanks to the entire team of Lime. You rock!);"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Greeshma J,09 October 2018,5,"I have been a regular online customer of Squeeze @ The Lime, Gachibowli for nearly two years. When it comes Italian food, especially the spaghetti pasta (aglio olio), this restaurant serves the best in Hyderabad. Trust me, I have tasted the said pasta in several restaurants in the city. But Squeeze @ The Lime's spaghetti and porcini aglio alio beats them all!"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Shankar Anappindi,05 October 2018,5,"This place is for those who love the aromas of ""Lemon Grass"".....you get to taste the shoots of it in their dishes too.    

I visited this place for about 6 times with family, friends & colleagues (reunions).  Every time I happened to have a variety to taste....especially the SOUP and the platter is colourful.....the STARTERS. In fact to be precise.....like the ""Death by Chocolate"" in icecreams, their specialty is ""Death by Starters"".....they are just enough for your craving muscles & blends of buds. 

The hospitality is a near very good and courtesy is the topping on the ice.  My 3 cheers and 5 thumbs for this place.

Dr. Shankar Anappindi (9849669966)"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Shreyoshi Mandal,04 October 2018,4,"Sudden craving for Chole Bhature made me order their Platinum Combo for dinner. Priced at just Rs 129, I felt it was a steal deal! The Sandwich and sweet were delicious. Chole Bhature was kind of okayish. Overall, this pack is good enough for two people. Also, thumbs up for the efficient and hygienic packaging. üëç
Will I reorder? Yes ofcourse and would recommend others as well!"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Deepti Agarwal,03 October 2018,5,"Amazingly delicious veg food without garlic and onions....the variety and the menu are all very amazing ...planner tikka, pizza and Malaysian curry were out of this world....

Squeeze @ The Lime,Bhakti,11 September 2018,5,"Awesome food n awesome staff. Never had such food in hyderabad.
Ambience Food Atmosphere, all makes you feel great. Working staff is very friendly"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Kshitindra Jain,09 September 2018,5,"Simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north Indian food. I hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! It was an important personal occasion for me and I wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and Lime staff (specially the manager, Dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. Food was excellent. Starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. My guest just kept asking for more and more and Lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. I just loved their Ajwaini Paneer tikka, corn Manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. Pain puri and dahi puri were good too. And yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. Main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. All curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. Rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). They served Jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.

Would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. They were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! What more I could have asked for. At the end special thanks to Lime manager Dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had. I would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Narendar Sriram,06 September 2018,5,"This place is easily one of the best exclusive Vegetarian restaurants in Hyderabad. Their food menu is exhaustive; includes all cuisines from South Indian, Italian, Orient, Thai and our favourite North Indian. And the best part is, all of them are mouth watering-delicious. The staff is very friendly and the service is impeccable. The prices are affordable too. I was pleasantly surprised when I looked at the prices as the taste and quality was way above what they charge. I‚Äôm gonna visit this place atleast once every fortnight!"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Rohit Jain,04 September 2018,5,I've been to Squeeze @ The Lime many times with my family. We always enjoy the food here. We like the Ambience. Chef Mr. Dinesh is the best!!
Squeeze @ The Lime,Pranjal Shukla,02 September 2018,4,"The food is really nice and quite authentic. I've been to this place multiple times during Lunch and Dinner and this place never disappointed me.

Be any cuisine, they do justice to it. Whether it's Chinese, Indian or Italian, everything tastes good. It's a must visit for a Vegetarian food lover.

Must try are Soups and Chinese Starters.

Now the Downside: The buffet here is OK and cheap. Not sure why the quality gets degraded in buffet but same tastes good in Alacarte."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Honey,31 August 2018,4,"Great vegetarian food. Either you have food at their outlet or order home or go for their catering services for party, they serve amazing food. Food options are decently good and staff is very courteous. For a small scale party recently I took their catering services and I must say all my guests and family were delighted with the diverse menu as well as quality of food. Great job Squeeze lime team: Mr. Raj, Mr. Dinesh thanks for great food and excellent coordination."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Krishanu Ganguli,31 August 2018,3,"I have been to this place many times. I feel their buffets need to improve. I just did not feel it to be upto the mark. The A la carte is far better. The decor s good, with really courteous staff."
Squeeze @ The Lime,RameshPriya,20 August 2018,4,"Went for a lunch buffet on a Monday and the restaurant was not crowded. Ambiance was very good. Starters served were good especially corn and finger potato which was too crispy and yummy with the mayonnaise. Pizza was average. Main course included was Mushroom fried rice, roti with paneer curry, pasta, noodles and they are all decent. All in all for the price(299 + tax), this place gave us good food for the buds."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Prashant Pathak,13 August 2018,4,"I recently had team lunch here. It was a buffet lunch and I got surprised for their price, it was 300 on weekdays. They have good starter like pizza slices, pani and dahi puri, banana cutlet and one manchuriya. Then there is enough item for main course. Its not much specious place so I would say book a table before visiting. Over all I found this place good and value for money."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Sandhya,08 August 2018,1,"The food packing is very good

But the food taste is very worse

I'm very disappointed"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Rohit Goyal,03 August 2018,4,"Nice ambience for having buffet lunch...quick, hot and tasty servings
Since it is located inside roads no hassle of traffic sound..
Must try dahi paani poori..."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Sahil Dhawan,28 July 2018,3,Chutney wasn‚Äôt good in taste. Rest was good.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Pavan Kumar,24 July 2018,5,"Recently I had my Son's Birthday at SQUEEZE AT THE LIME ...I am amazed with the Food they have provided at Lime.The Staff behaviour was very good and the patience of the staff when they serve the starters is nice.Out of the food they have provided,Gulabjamun dessert( with hot chocolate sauce)and all the starters were excellent.Rest of the food is good.Its worth to book this banquet hall which can accommodate upto 50 people."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Veera Raghavan,22 July 2018,2,Too much plastic for packing.. 30% of whole order were just plastic covers.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Ujj,21 July 2018,4,"had the chinese combo and the street food combo from this place.the delivey was really fast.i liked how they packaged their food.It was quite sturdy and the food didn't spill.
The food was perfectly spiced too."
Squeeze @ The Lime,Kunika Valecha,21 July 2018,2,Dessert was not edible
Squeeze @ The Lime,Nishit Vakharia,19 July 2018,5,"I ordered a Platinum combo today. I requested the chef to prepare it Jain. It included Chole Bhature, Sandwich, starter(Manchurian corn), a dessert ( malai sandwich),salad and a juice (Frooti). I must say taste was amazing especially Manchurian corn and mouth watering malai sandwich. Chole Bhature too tasted good.
There are few restaurants in Gachibowli which are veg and out of them very few which prepares it Jain. Squeeze Veg is one of the finest veg restaurants which maintains its quality and service. Kudos to Chef Dinesh who customises the order on request. Keep up the good work!!"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Deep,19 July 2018,5,"Amazing Birthday party hosted @ Lime ! Excellent food and superb service n staff support ! Highly recommend for food , stay n other celebrations !!"

Squeeze @ The Lime,Anuraag,06 July 2018,1,"Horrible food... The noodles and the so called starter which basically was gobi fried to death looked and tasted like they were living in oil well all their life and had come out for once to give me the scare of my life..

Squeeze @ The Lime,Mohammed,28 June 2018,1,"So was here like 10 mins back, the place is kinda okayish but considering that price range it becomes even more undesirable.. dessert was probably the best part of the whole course.. everything else was mediocre at best. The Atmosphere is lack luster so even that doesn't help.. So yeah not the most exciting places to visit"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Pakka-veg Man!,28 June 2018,2,very spicy and vada is uncooked.. disappointing

Squeeze @ The Lime,Asheesh,30 April 2018,1,"Must read - I went to this place with my friends for buffet lunch. We had two options for welcome drink - one is pineapple and other is grape which were not natural fruit juices they tasted as preservatives, then moving on to soup - manchow soup was good, waiter forget to give us the starter. Served us after we reminding him, we liked crispy baby corn among 3 varieties of starters which he took 10 mints to serve for the second serve when only 10% of the place was occupied. When I asked him mayo dip waiter was giving us the left over part of dip on the table beside. When I asked for chilled water they were saying they don't have, later one of my friend asked the same person he gave us chilled water. All the items which were placed at buffet were cold not even Luke warm. Biryani was totally dried out rice was sticking to the vessel had lot more bad experience here on same day"
Squeeze @ The Lime,Jitendra,29 April 2018,4,packing was nice. food was good. but pineapple was ripped perfectly as well as it was not fresh. another thing is I ordered for juice pack and u sent me water bottle.
Squeeze @ The Lime,Sridevi Ericsson,29 April 2018,3,"Vada, Poha both were not good.... not cooked well. Tetrapack juice as chosen was not given. Food was not great."

Items ordered: Rashmi kabab,Paya Soup,Chicken biryani,Mutton biryani

Biryani is okay, soup is nice.

Overall good for one time visit."
Khaan Saab,Mayank,17 May 2019,1,"Had the worst service of my life. Had to wait for more than 2 hours for the main course. It was later told that there was some problem with the kitchen. They later served food when we were standing outside and waiting for the bill. This could be a one off problem, but I expected better communication from the staff, so that we could have made alternate plans instead of waiting endlessly for 2 hours when they kept telling us that food will come in the next 5-10mins."
Khaan Saab,Susmitha Penisetti,12 May 2019,4,"I have been to khaan Saab in Vijayawada earlier and loved the food and ambience. Hence, chose to go to this place as I wanted to eat some naan and paneer butter masala.the ambience is good and the food is just amazing. From starters to main course, food was just yum. They have got an interesting nawabi sort of menu. Prices are lightly high and that's fine for me because the taste is worth the money.

Food - 4.5
Ambience - 4
Service - 4
Menu and pricing - 3.5"
Khaan Saab,Agastyaraju Koushik,09 May 2019,1,"I have been to khaan saab couple of days before before i went there i have gone through all the reviews in zomato and i was amazed with those reviews(paid reviews). The worse experience i had at khaan saab.

Cons: worse hospitality
Non friendly staff
Worse food

Even i asked for mint chutney they brought some junk from the storage and made some garbage chutney. I have paid 2000 for 3 dishes.Its totally worthless and damn.... paid reviews.

I am suggesting you to dnt take your office collegues and higher officials."
Khaan Saab,Subhani Subbu,08 May 2019,1,Worst experience especially at Gachibowli branch.No proper management. Food was not cooked properly. Food quality was worst and quantity was less and prices were huge.
Khaan Saab,Kalyan Madduru,05 May 2019,4,"Khaan Saab, in Gachibowli was known for it's ambience and interesting kebab menu.

We ordered murgh sheek kabab and chicken Tikka biryani. Kebab starter was good, with minced chicken kebab. Chicken Tikka biryani was chefs special here, and rightly mentioned. Biryani was undoubtedly one of the best in the city. It was served with 6+ medium sized boneless Tikka pieces, smoky grilled and raitha. Simply loved the spice flavors in biryani.

Al 388 bucks, after Zomato GOLD discount"
Khaan Saab,Shibasish Nandi,05 May 2019,1,"They charge premium for the food and serve stale food contaminated with stones. Though they didn't charge for the curry, but it's not at all acceptable from such restaurant. Won't recommend at all."
Khaan Saab,Sriteja,05 May 2019,5,Food was nice and good staff supportive .ambience was also soothing .Interior lighting should be more contrast from the current so that food can be views before served
Khaan Saab,Harshet Agarwal,04 May 2019,5,"needless to say the place has been there for many years in Banjara Hillsgood that u have opened in Gachibowli
i usually get delivery 
but the experience is truly great being there.
some of the best north west frontier cuisine i have ever eaten 
i really miss the Kofta e Pashtun here 
will definitely order soon"
Khaan Saab,Phani Dileep,30 April 2019,4,"Staff is super friendly and the great ambiance will give you the good feeling, coming to the taste it's good with masala quotients so pretty much indulgence. Finally could be a 4 of 5 value for your money"
Khaan Saab,Mitali Agrawal,29 April 2019,2,"We went for team dinner. Starters tasted very bad. Paneer was too hard. Service was very poor. They took 45 min to serve starters. And then they brought all the main course including rice at one go, by the time we ate roti the rice went cold.
Overall a bad experience."
Khaan Saab,Amandeep Singh Parmar,27 April 2019,5,The murgh Resham kebab n murgh kurchan were awesome.. The meal was satisfying and the service by Tapan was very prompt and friendly... We would like to visit the place again!
Khaan Saab,Shivaraj Mathrubai,26 April 2019,5,Great food! Slow service! Great food! Slow service Great food! Slow service!! Great food! Slow servic Great food! Slow service! e! Great food! Slow service!
Khaan Saab,Vishnuadapa,26 April 2019,1,"Food is not up to mark. We went for a project lunch and it's not worth for money. Biryani rice is hard and it has no salt at all. In chicken biryani they gave chicken Tikka pieces not sure who asked them for. Tangdi kabab Smells very bad.

This branch is no where compared to gvk Khan sab which is famous for their authentic city"
Khaan Saab,Sweetie Bhamre,23 April 2019,1,"So we have been here last week,
Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can‚Äôt eat.
Steam rice was salty too.
Frankly speak, we did not like food except reshami kabab. Rest of food was pathetic."
Khaan Saab,Vinayak Au,22 April 2019,1,Been to this place had the worst experience found hair in food not once but thrice and got plastic particle in shorba. We‚Äôve complained the management I‚Äôm sure food here is cooked with least hygiene and neatness. Try avoiding this place.
Khaan Saab,Sumit Arora,20 April 2019,4,"Very good service , went with my kids in Saturday night amazing experience , paneer was really up to the mark ... Service led by Mr tapan who served us was amazing ... Definitely worth another visit..."
Khaan Saab,Rakesh Korada,19 April 2019,2,Was high on expectations after visiting khaan Saab in GVK. I was disappointed with taste and quality of the food. The service was mediocre and it seems to no make justice to call itself a branch of khaan Saab. Even ambience seemed to be a cheap knockoff.Service was okay.
Khaan Saab,Asha Akunuri,13 April 2019,3,"The restaurant was quite big and maintained very clean and neat with best hospitality .
Have been here on Friday evening , place was not much crowded and there was occupancy of only two tables .
Ordered the below :
Chicken tikka biriyani : This was mentioned as must try in menu card . It tasted good .
Tawa mutton biriyani : It tasted good with aromas of spices .
Paya soup : did not meet the expectations . It was not up to the mark . Tried tomato soup too . It did not taste well . Mushroom masala curry : quantity was very less and taste üëéüèª

Ambience : 4/5
Food : 3/5
Hospitality was good . They treated us as royal guest üòÄ"
Khaan Saab,Krushikal,11 April 2019,3,This restaurant is not for people who like dum biryani. Its a royal dining restaurant with that kind of interiors and biryani tastes good as well
Khaan Saab,Surya Tej Kanuri,08 April 2019,1,"*no one is a royal guest..*

Food - 2/7
Ambiance - 3/7
Service - 3/7
Vfm -2/7

I unfortunately took my guests to Khaan Saab and learnt a life lesson - never try/experiement new places when you have guests.. üòêüôÑ

We ordered mutton galauti kebab, mirchi chicken Tikka and paneer tikka for starters.. What place doesn't have mint chutney when you serve kebabs..?! Yes, they dint have mint chutney.. And galauti kebab was so difficult to finish..

Pata soup was no better too.. In main course we ordered Tikka biryani and veg biryani.. And they dint have mirchi ka salan in this.. Tikka biryani was sweet on taste.. It actually tasted like drumstick curry to me.. Such weird analogy but true.. Raita was the only thing I liked of all..

They dint have lassi/soda or milk shakes too.. I dint even bother to click any pics.. What a way to disappoint my guests.. üôàüòÖ"
Khaan Saab,Dakshay Singh,08 April 2019,5,Great food. Excellent ambience for a nice quiet dinner for family. Zomato gold benefits can be availed here. Excellent customer service. Great service by Tapan. Very happy
Khaan Saab,Sujith Varma,08 April 2019,5,Food is awesome. I will visit it quite often from now. I suggest you to try out this delicious taste of biryani and wonderful hospitality and special mention to Topan.
Khaan Saab,Navya Kuppili,07 April 2019,2,"Have been here today and the service here is very very slow even in non peak hours. They keep forgetting orders, we need to remind them twice or thrice. Don't feel like coming back. Restaurant is overhyped and food is not up to the mark."
Khaan Saab,Sankalp Khare,05 April 2019,5,Great Service by Tapan. Had super tazty Mutton with very soft rumali roti and tandoori roti. Having paya shorba as always is a great experience.
Khaan Saab,Syed Maheboob,05 April 2019,3,The restaurant and food was good we planned for buffet but unfortunately there was no buffet serving on Friday‚Äôs that thing I was not knowing. They should mention about the buffet serving days. Food was good biryani not up to the mark.
Khaan Saab,Satyendra Kumar,05 April 2019,5,Tapan @ khaan Saab has served us a very good and tasty food. Loved burani sahi Malai yummy. Also garam gulab jamun was yummy. thanks for the tasty food. Keep up the good work.
Khaan Saab,Girish,05 April 2019,4,"This is one of the very few restaurants which lived up to the ratings with complete satisfaction.

The team is extremely friendly and food was awesome. Without a second thought this is the restaurant you can go in regardless of vegetarian or non-vegetarian.

Big thumbs up"
Khaan Saab,Kumar.abs,04 April 2019,5,Excellent food and food hospitality extended. Waiter Tapan took special care. Would recommend. Place is good for a small get-together for official purpose as well.
Khaan Saab,Vikram Padma,02 April 2019,3,"Visited this branch with high expectations as the food in GVK One branch was too good, but food in this branch is not upto the expectationsz"
Khaan Saab,Navin Bobby,02 April 2019,1,"This is the worst place in Zomato gold I ever visited,waste of money,service is worst and the service Boys can't even open their mouth properly to talk and very low energy not statisfied...They charged high amount than MRP on water bottle..no intimation before we order...worst worst worst experience....üò°üò°üò°üòåüòå"
Khaan Saab,Arji Vyshnavi,31 March 2019,5,"Good food and service from tapan , nice taste , worth a try , located at the very central location convenient. Reshmi kebab is excellent try it out"
Khaan Saab,RITESH KUMAR Singh,31 March 2019,4,Good food with royal service. One the best thing for a heavy brunch. They also give a chamber for a big group üòâ. Only the lassi was a bit off otherwise it would have been the best.
Khaan Saab,Sharanya.naga77,31 March 2019,4,"Went out for Lunch with friends to this place. The service is good.
We have ordered corn cheese kurkuri which was very good and veg/non veg Biryanis were okay.

Same experience twice at different places."
Khaan Saab,Avinash Sharma,27 March 2019,5,"Amazing food. Tikki is a must try and dahi ki kaloti ummm.

Khaan Saab,Kalyan Moturi,26 March 2019,2,"It was a bad experience on a saturday night after the DJ snake event we were all starving, we ended up this place. We ordered mutton kheema, Mutton biryani and subz veg biryani which was in lucknowi style and not at all good. Those who prefer hydrabadi style biryani please stay out of this place. Ambience is also not at all good when compared to Bankara Hills Khaan Saab. Not a place to visit again, so guys think more than twice before visiting this place. 
Service 3
Food 2
Ambience 2.5"
Khaan Saab,Dhruv Gaur,26 March 2019,4,Khaan Saab never disappoints. The ambiance is that of a vintage haveli which is nothing too extraordinary. Food however steals the show. Highly recommend Dal Khaan Saab. The place is perfect for north Indian cuisine on a lazy weekend.
Khaan Saab,Ankit,25 March 2019,1,"One of those times, when you actually regret for not able give ratings less than zero.Pathetic service,foods way costlier than its quality, over hyped description for the decor, I can go on and on..

and jesus!! there are some basic differences between pinapple/apple juice and pudina juice, texture and smell, u gotta understand that, before demanding that you are one of the best in your genre."
Khaan Saab,Ismail Mohamed,25 March 2019,5,"Food was good, ambience has the royalty
Service was good
Tapan was too polite
Raan e Khan saheb is a must try
If u want a royal treatment give it a shot"
Khaan Saab,Ashutosh Choudhari,24 March 2019,4,"Pretty good place to go out on weekend. I had chicken and mutton biryani. Mutton biryani was really delectable. Chicken was spicy n tasty as well but the biryani rice was bland and could have been more spicy. Quantity was good and 2 plates were enough to feed 3 diners.
Ambience was good but the lighting could be more improved. It was little dark. You can get the idea from photos.
Service was really great and the way I expected to be. There was this waiter named Tapan who had provided impressive service.
Overall I would like to rate 4.5 out of 5."
Khaan Saab,Mr Kumar,24 March 2019,5,"Been to this place for the first time. Had amazing time .
Great ambiance and music.
Excellent food and service. Especially by Mr tapanüòä
Bestestest place for food"
Khaan Saab,Siva Kumar,23 March 2019,4,"Food(4/5)- We had chicken Tikka biryani and mutton biryani. Mutton biryani was really very good. You will get the authentic Lucknowi style flavor. Pieces were also very good. Mutton biryani is a must try, you would certainly enjoy it.

Service-(4/5) They were very smooth in accepting the zomato gold. Even the service was very good. They were attentive and brought all the demanded things swiftly.

Ambience-(4/5) It was good. You will have the royal feel. The plates n all were good. The lobby had a big elephant and beautiful interiors."
Khaan Saab,Tanya.pandove,23 March 2019,5,We had a great experience at Khan Saab. Santanu was attending our table and was very cooperative and took special care of our orders. The food quality is very good.
Khaan Saab,Sudeshna Dutta,22 March 2019,4,Good food but slightly over priced. But great service by Tapan. great ambience. Loved it overall. Tundey kebabs were really nice. Chicken tikka biriyani was also good
Khaan Saab,Puja Agarwal,22 March 2019,4,"Over all - Nice place, good food.

Ambience- pretty dark, good for dinners, gives you a feel of dinner even at lunch. But the feel is nice.

Food- we ordered kurmure cheese kebab, Kadhai paneer kashmiri, and garlic naan. These were delicious.

Meccai kebab was spicy and okayish. You may order if you are a big big fan of the spicy combo of corn kebab."
Khaan Saab,Satish,21 March 2019,5,"Good and polite service. Ambience is good and our daughter liked it very much..........
We liked the soups more than the main course.
Tapan served us well :-)"
Khaan Saab,Mayank Agarwal,21 March 2019,5,The food was awesome and as was the ambience. The service provided by Tapan was also very good. We loved the place a lot. A place to visit for sure. The chicken dishes were good.

Khaan Saab,SAI KIRAN N,19 March 2019,5,Nice place. Tapan and dharma raj served us very well. Served instantaneously. Good and delicious food. Nice music. Good ambience. Good menu.
Khaan Saab,Sanjana Roy,18 March 2019,5,"I went to khaansaab on a Sunday night. It was pretty empty so we thought it might not be that good. We ordered tunday kabaab , corn cheese roll and reshmi kabab. All were very good and we loved the reshmi kabaab. The chicken and mutton in all the dishes were very soft which made it more delicious. For main course we had chicken Tikka biryani which was also a very good dish. So overall a very nice experience."
Khaan Saab,Imran Shaik,17 March 2019,5,"Excellent service and good ambiance. Tapan steward was extremely nice and gentle with his service on my table. Happy with the service more than food....

I should not forget Mr Prashant as well for the service and quality."
Khaan Saab,Mohammed Yakhoob,10 March 2019,5,Santosh was a great host. Spot on service and exceptional taste. Truly relished all the dishes we ordered. Awesome experience. Worth the money

Khaan Saab,Nikita,05 March 2019,4,"Went for dinner with friends and family several times. The place has a great ambience and really good food. Their aloo tikki chaat and hara subz kebab (main course) are our all time favourites.
The service is also really good. A great option for fine dining with family!"
Khaan Saab,Himanshi Mishra,02 March 2019,4,"The place is spacious, ambience is pretty good. It's a typical mughlai restaurant where you can find good north indian tase. Coming to the food.. the variety in menu is too less. The taste is good but as compared to price quantity is less."
Khaan Saab,Sarfaraz Hussain,01 March 2019,4,"Very nice ambience with a courteous staff, I particularly liked the hospitality of a service boy named Ashok - he recommended the best food and provided an excellent service. The food was nice."

Khaan Saab,Anil Kumar Vempati,24 February 2019,1,"I have had high regards for Khansaab over years, eversince they've started in GVKone. today I was disappointed with their service and how they've handled an issue (Reg Soup) reported.
Even the manager at Gachibowli proved Useless.. i never thought i will write such a review for Khan Saab."
Khaan Saab,Vaibhav Bajaj,23 February 2019,5,This place made my visit to Hyderabad worth it. Had amazing Tundey kebab along with a Burani parantha. It was totally a soul warming meal. Server Santosh was quick and polite. Will come again next time I visit Hyderabad.

Family friendly.
And a very big elephant at reception is good attraction"
Khaan Saab,Ankit Jindal,10 February 2019,4,"We ordered Tawa fish, Reshmi chicken and Tunday kebab for starterd.
All three were delicious and tender. The fish felt as smooth as butter.
Chicken tikka biryani was different from the usual Hyderabadi Biryani - Good or bad, that you have to decide for yourself- But do try.
Special thanks to our server Santosh for recommending the dishes and for great service."
Khaan Saab,Navya Chakradhar,10 February 2019,5,Good and yummy food. We ordered Murgh Dhaniya shorba soup which was so delicious followed with Lal Mirchi teeka tikka which was tender and juicy. Mutton Tawa Biryani is no less compared to others. Will visit again.
Khaan Saab,Gurutej,10 February 2019,5,Good food and a nice ambience. The must try items are Burani Paratha and Qubani ka meetha. The service is also efficient and quick. Special mention to Ashok who was very prompt in responding to us.
Khaan Saab,Vankat Sandheya,09 February 2019,5,"Royalty is redefined at few places in our city when it comes to good food ambience. We can say khaan Saab is one of that.
Now coming to the decors and furniture they are grand.
Chicken shorba was awesome.... Malai kebab yummy my kid like that too much , and fish biryani was good... Over all we enjoyed lot with my family .staff are polite and friendly ...."

Service by Ashok was great and appreciate his suggestions."
Khaan Saab,Akbar Hussain,07 February 2019,5,Had an awesome experience having a blend of non veg cuisines and veg dishes! Strongly recommend this for parties and all sorts of get togethers!!
Khaan Saab,Venu Gopal,07 February 2019,4,"This place will make you to feel like a royal guest... Ambiance gives us the small sample of royalness of our earlier Indian Kings... Great food,good service,little over priced
Service:5/5
Food:4.5/5
Ambiance:5/5"
Khaan Saab,Aamir Nawaz,04 February 2019,3,"Dishes Tried: Lal Mirch Tikka, Tundey Kebab, Rajwada Ghost

The food is okay not great, doesn't really live up to the hype. Tundey kebab was good but a little bit on spicy side. Rajwada Ghost was awesome.

goodespecially the Kabsa Laham. Its a must have for everyone. Grilled chicken was a let down though

The staff wasn't very welcoming when we mentioned we will using DineOut for payments and you could sense their attitude change. The ambience is pretty standard and looks empty."
Khaan Saab,Vasantha Lakshmi,03 February 2019,5,"An all time favourite of ours. As you enter the restaurant you will find a big sized elephant near the waiting area, little ahead on the right you will find a private dining rooms.
Fantabulous ambience with great food royalty can be experienced at khaan Saab . Tundey kebab will be stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try, staff were brilliant,courteous, friendly too, they even had pan, which was delicious.

Overall,it's a place to have good food and spend quality time with your friends and family ............"
Khaan Saab,Suresh Kumar,02 February 2019,5,"One of the best restaurant in city. Food, ambiance & service as well. I had the best seafood hear in the city. price also friendly . i would suggest to visit once hear."
Khaan Saab,Foodies Hyderabad,01 February 2019,5,"I visited with my friends on last Monday,I enjoyed the good time food was really nice and service was very good. I want to recommended to others."
Khaan Saab,Saathvik 94,30 January 2019,1,What do I say!!..this is the worst place available in Gachibowli.Ordered few starters..the taste was so bad that we ended up not ordering main course.
Khaan Saab,Gopalsuneel,30 January 2019,1,We went for a team lunch. Worst food ever I had in recent times. Rotten smell in fish n chicken. NEVER EVER VISIT THIS PLACE.I WONDER HOW THIS RESTAURANT GOT THOSE AWARDS
Khaan Saab,Apoorva Madhavan,20 January 2019,4,"Good for some biryanis and probably the ambience if you were to impress someone you host.

As for the quantities served and the price, wouldn't really be keen on visiting too often."
Khaan Saab,Siva Gopichand Reddy Maruri,19 January 2019,5,Have been here multiple times because of the variety of dishes. My mouth waters when I think about the dishes I like. Lal Mirchi ka theekha tikka - is a must try chcien dish.
Khaan Saab,Krishna Bh,18 January 2019,2,We went for lunch in weekday. Restaurant is with ok ambience and nizam style plates and glasses. Ordered biryani. Biryani full of masala and little rice. Jyadha masala thoda rice. Food taste is ok but not worth it. Food cost is peeeeeeekss. One water bottle cost is 47Rs. Highly costly food.
Khaan Saab,Nillu,15 January 2019,1,"We went to this restaurant for new year lunch and literally one of the worst experience seriously nothing was there in veg staters 3,4 items and in nonvg 3,4 items and desert only ice cream and fruit salad .. and very expressive also ..."
Khaan Saab,Pradeep Koney,02 January 2019,5,"Fantabulous ambience with great food. Royalty can be experienced at Khaan Saab. Went there for New Year's Dinner with Family and the food we tried were yummy & lip smacking. Dhahi Ki Galouti will stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try. Other dishes we tried were Paneer ka Soola in Veg, Lal Mirch Ka Teekha Tikka in Non Veg, Hari Mirch Ki Roti in Breads & Angarey Jamum in Desserts. All of them were exceptionally good. Only thing we felt was prices are steep for the quantity they serve. But all is well when the food is great and ambience is awesome."
Khaan Saab,Roy Burmon,19 December 2018,5,"As the tag line itself says Be The Royal Guest, Khaansaab actually keeps up with it. You are indeed welcomed as a royal guest here. Filled with its authentic awesome delicacies, its an ideal place for a quality dining with family as well as friends.
Rajwada Raj Gosht is a must try, I bet you would be mesmerized by the tender lamb pieces in the spicy curry."
Khaan Saab,Bharat Yagnala,23 November 2018,1,"Since there was a party going on in the main restaurant we have been diverted to a subsidiary of the same.

Literally worthless. A shame to the fane of KhaanSaab.

Open doors, full of mosquitoes, no captain to advice on the order, no proper care.

Been the worst dinner experience ever. And to have that on the day of my wedding anniversary was disastrous.

Ruined my date.

Will never ever return here.

Thanks for totally ruining my date."
Khaan Saab,Furkhan Shareef,18 November 2018,4,"Went out for casual family dinner, tried the palak chat for starters it was yummm, worth a try. Also tried mutton galawti kebab and a fish starter. Mutton kebabs were really good, fish starter took lot of time to get served and still lacked the taste, but disappointed with the fish starter.Ordered peshawari chicken and few naans for the mains, both the gravy and naans were up to the mark. Biryani was also decent. It‚Äôs a place worth a try."
Khaan Saab,Smita Singh,15 November 2018,4,"Want to experience the Royal food and service?? Visit this place and you won't be disappointed. Perfect place to experience the rich favor of North Indian dishes. Ambience is good with dim lighting. Service is good with friendly staff.
Delicious food. Would highly recommend the Burani paratha. Do try other dishes too.
And yeah ambience of Banjara hills branch is better."
Khaan Saab,Shashank Kale,08 November 2018,2,"Ambience is good but the food needs improvement in all the aspects. Service was a bit slow too.
This place is just overhyped and the food quality has to be improved.
It is pricey and is definitely not value for money."
Khaan Saab,Steve Rogers,04 November 2018,3,The ambience of the place is great. The food was not to my liking. I have had better biriyani in Hyderabad. I ordered a mutton Roman Josh the meat was really hard.
Khaan Saab,Tamal Sarkar,02 November 2018,4,"It was a Thursday night that we decide to go to this Khaan Saab - and get the feeling of being a Royal Guest!

The ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line - it gives you the Royal Feeling

We ordered main course only as we were way too hungry !

Butter Naan
Punjabi Kulcha
Chicken Kurchan
Chicken Khandar

First of all I felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place I would buy it if the food is also that good!

The Butter Naan had loads of Butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it!
The Kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was Punjabi Kulcha
Both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy.
We were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people.
Given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this.
However we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place.

So we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food. The taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money.

However there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place.
We asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water

We had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml Aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle.

And they charged 150 for that in the bill, quite ironical when the MRP is 10 for these bottles
They charge GST and they charge water at such a idiotic price.

We clicked many pictures near the giant Elephant near the entrance. The whole place was very well decorated and I could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures."
Khaan Saab,Sameer Panda,31 October 2018,5,"Be it food quality or taste or guest treatment or ambience, Awesome will be the only word to describe the experience. Rarely I‚Äôve experienced such quality of food whose taste is unique and really stands out. Would love to visit again with friends & family. A special mention about restaurant manager Mr Pandab for his brilliant guest management skill and absolutely polite approach."
Olive Garden,Smrati Saxena,23 May 2019,3,"I ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place, first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon. second the quantity was really less of manchurian. some improvement in food is suggested"
Olive Garden,Madhup,18 April 2019,4,"A really nice place. The ambience was very very good. The views from here are killer. But honestly for me and my friends, their menu was not enough. Still, worth a look."
Olive Garden,Naveen,31 March 2019,3,"Food and ambience is average, waiter is not serving the food properly, we need to keep asking him to bring salads, chutneys and all, finally he demanded particular amount tip while paying the bill."
Olive Garden,Manas Ranjan Sahu,27 March 2019,5,Staffs are very professional. It was an excellent experience. We had chatpata tandoori kabbab was fantabulous. The place is super good and must recommend for kabbabs.
Olive Garden,Kumar Abhishek,16 March 2019,4,"Good lunch and buffet menu. Loved this place. Had been here a few times with my team for linch buffets.

So here goes my review:
Food:4/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service:4/5
Budget: 3/5"
Olive Garden,Ananth Popuri,09 March 2019,3,"Place was fine. And the food was okay. But i guess the people who served us was not sure about Zomato offers when you are a gold member.

It‚Äôs good for buffet, but I would not recommend for Zomato gold membership."
Olive Garden,Ramesh Kendre,05 March 2019,5,"Came with my friend for birthday celebration we ordered al a carte starter broccoli nuggets,fried baby corn , paneer pahadi kebab was awesome. Main course we ordered Biryani was nice. Ambiance was good. Friendly staff over all it's pocket friendly restaurant."
Olive Garden,SHYAM SUNDER,04 March 2019,5,"Went with family for dinner ordered soup and chicken satay it was very good. Main course ordered mutton organ josh and butter nan it was awesome ambiance is OK. Over all its good restaurant.

Food- 5/5
Sevice- 5/5
Ambiance - 5/5"
Olive Garden,Neeharika,04 March 2019,2,"I went for dinner with my friends. The food is good. We ordered chicken manchow soup, apolo fish as starters and alfredo pasta as the main course.
Butt we found a cockroach on the table while we were having our dinner.

So, 2 star as it really freaked me out!"
Olive Garden,Sujatha Kutnur,03 March 2019,5,"Was in Gachibowli recently regarding some work and landed up in Olive Garden for dinner after seeing their reviews. Food was exceptionally good, especially their crispy corn. Even their main course items namely malai kofta and chana masala were very good. All in all a very satisfying experience."
Olive Garden,Manikanta Annamraju,03 March 2019,3,Food is good. Good for ordering for team lunch if you prefer not to go out. Ambience is not very good. This is my personal experience.No offense.
Olive Garden,Thehungryhyderabadi,12 February 2019,3,"This one is near to paradise gachibowli. The ambience is decent and the service is fine. We tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course, we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti. Pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price. Either the quantity or price could be changed. Main course was fine, especially butter naan was really nice."
Olive Garden,Neelesh Singh,10 February 2019,1,Kindly stop listing north indian dishes like chicken chatpata. I haven't tasted any item like this smelling and tasting like only curry leafs. Just put me in a bad mood. Complete waste of money.
Olive Garden,Namballa Gopi,08 February 2019,5,"Came with my family ordered pepper chicken, corn soup, Rogan gosht and biryani. all was testy it's good hospitality restaurant. I would recommend 5/5."
Olive Garden,Taj Hosen,08 February 2019,5,"I'm visited Olive Garden with my team around 9 members, we had taken buffet they served 6 starter, it was excellent. Specially chicken kebab and Appolo fish was very good. Main course was also good. Chicken Biryani was awesome in desserts. Rasmalai was mouth smashing. Honestly we had enjoyed a lot. Ambiance is nice. Service was good and staff also. It's a pocket friendly restaurant. I would suggest visit once."
Olive Garden,Rahul Sai,07 February 2019,1,"Sincerely I have never seen such a worst service ever, management doesn't know how to speak with customers.

We went for Ala-carte and taste of food is too low.

Even buffet experience is also not worth for cost"
Olive Garden,Jayaram,31 January 2019,1,"Been exploring about restaurants in Gachibowli and found this place. Been to this restaurant ordered chicken drumsticks and spl chicken biryani which tasted really good, finally ended with a good dinner. As the taste was good ordered a non veg combo next day and surprised to see a cockroach in the meal. It was really a bad experience to see a cockroach where the restaurant has taken away all the positive views that I had towards it. Please don‚Äôt play with health of customers, it takes time for anybody to order food again if we come across these situations. Please note that Restaurants shouldn‚Äôt be the place to hospitalise customers by making them unhealthy. Apologies will not do anything, maintain healthy and hygiene environment. Thank you olive, you lost a customer and I will not visit this place anymore."
Olive Garden,Vaishali Ghosh,19 January 2019,4,"This is a good place for north Indian food to have. We went very late around 10pm BT they are open till 11 i guess. We ordered golden prawns, tandoori chicken bhuna murg, butter nan. The tandoori which was really good.only the masala kulcha was not upto the mark and less pieces with no masala inside it. This is a zomato gold resturant which can save you bucks.
Tandoori chicken - 4.5
Golden prawn - 4
Bhuna murg - 4.5
Nan and kulcha - 4 so over all food - 4
Ambience - 4
Staff response - 4"
Olive Garden,Namit Agarwal,30 December 2018,4,"A decent restaurant among pubs and restaurant in Indira Nagar to have some proper North Indian food.

In food, I tried Paneer tikka masala, masala kulcha, and some masala Papad. All of them were pretty good. It has the complete feel of a family restaurant and the prices are also pretty reasonable. The quantity of the food is decent as compared to the price.

The ambiance is nice and the staff is courteous."
Olive Garden,Srikant,07 December 2018,4,Biriyani quantity is less
Olive Garden,Rinkal MIstry,29 November 2018,1,"The worst place. I went there with a frnd today. We ordered Manchow soup and Alfredo penne pasta. The service is damn slow. Soup didn't have any taste
Pasta was terrible. They just boiled it and dipped into a bowl of white sauce. Nothing else."
Olive Garden,Harsha Pops,28 November 2018,4,"This place is just great, was actually skeptical before entering the restaurant but then the crew were really humble. When I first entered, the whole place was empty but with in 30 mins, the place was all full.

Their dishes were a great deal. Maybe not any different from the regular items, but were really tasty. And mutton rogan josh, is a must try."
Olive Garden,Ravi Bajaj,21 November 2018,3,"It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months.  I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times.

This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided.

There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.

Service wise I would rate this place a 2.5

The manager/executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins."
Olive Garden,Mimi,18 November 2018,5,"After getting suggestion from one of my friends, we went tonight there for the dinner. We were two and ordered Tandoor Chicken, Virgin Mojito cocktail, Veg Fried Rice and Schezwan Chicken...All the items were extremely good and very tasty. The price of each item in the menu was satisfactory. The behavior of the staffs were also so calm and polite. They accepted Zomato Gold too. We appreciate the job of the cook and the staffs there. The decoration and the sweet 90s music made the dinner fantastic. Loved to visit the restaurant and will surely visit again."
Olive Garden,Rajsi Gaikwad,17 November 2018,4,"We visited this place on a weeknight so there was very less crowd. The veg food was okay. On nonveg side we tried their buffet. They served soup with 2 starters, salad and some veg starters. The soup and the starters (the apolo fish and the chicken kebab which was not even close to any kebab) was good. The curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty. Overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate. The place was comfortable and the service was quick."
Olive Garden,Romy Mathew,08 November 2018,4,Olive garden cares - very difficult to find a restaurant where the staff is as good as the food. Maybe the first time I got the experience for which I have been shelling the extra bucks. My rating is based on the food and the quality of service.
Olive Garden,Taj Khan,06 November 2018,5,"Came with coligue for buffet and found the quality of food was very good. Buffet spread also good. Starters was yammy. Desserts was amazing. Service was very good and teams are attentive. We suggest to our other teams to come Olive Garden. Price is pocket friendly.

Food 5/5
Service 5/5

Olive Garden,Juhi Bakshi,04 November 2018,5,Loved the food and very reasonable rates. Food tastes fresh and relish-able. Pocket friendly meals & buffet. Would love to spend my weekends for full appetite Indian snacks and curries
Olive Garden,Susmit Ghosh,04 November 2018,5,Very nice food with home made style curries. full meal can be really enjoyed in the weekend or the weekdays buffet. best part is that the rates are quite economical. Worth a visit
Olive Garden,Sowmya4pragada,04 November 2018,5,"Very good delicious North Indian dishes served hot with little waiting time after ordering. Liked kadai veg curry and paneer butter masala plus Romali roti, good deserts, excellent place for food lovers

Olive Garden,Snehakumari,03 November 2018,2,Really average..had buffet lunch ... Served everything on table... Nothing great about it.. really average interiors.. food was just not bad.. but just above bad.. passing marks u could say in terms of food.. ambience and money.. wouldn't recommend it and big no for a 2nd time..tried and forgotten..
Olive Garden,Naveen Kumar,03 November 2018,3,"Have been here many times. I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. Its a quiet place and family friendly. The lift is old, dark and horrible. It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls."
Olive Garden,Samir Padhee,12 October 2018,1,"Bought coupon from nearbuy @ 375. It was mentioned that the actual price is 469 which is false.I have attached the price tag mentioned at their hotel.
I compared it with the other hotels near by and I feel it is highly overpriced.It should be aroud 250.
Very limited starters and sweet items as compared to other nearby hotels."
Olive Garden,Simanto Bagchi,06 October 2018,4,Read the reviews about this new place and ordered chicken dum biryani to try out. The quantity was ample and taste was also good. Looking forward to go there personally and check out some of their dishes.
Olive Garden,Dinesh Rajagiri,30 September 2018,3,"We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Food - 3/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 3/5
Value for money - 2.5/5
Overall - 3/5"
Olive Garden,AJ,29 September 2018,3,"Food was okay. Wish they didn‚Äôt put nuts in the pasta. Mushroom soup was good. Chicken and Fish was delicious, but too spicy. I mentioned no spicy in the Zomato notes, but it was super spicy."
Olive Garden,Rambha Simons,26 September 2018,5,"visited Olive Garden today with my office  team of 15.  Had to wait for half an hour to get the table. but it was worth the wait.  Buffet Food was too good, the non veg items and salads were lovely. Good service and staff.  Will come again"
Olive Garden,Anil Modipalle,26 September 2018,1,"Visited this place for lunch buffet after seeing a lot of good reviews! But it was a total disappointment. Food was not at all good. There were many items but none of them was good. On top of it attitude of owner/manager was icing on cake! Not sure how they got these many positive reviews!

Wish there was rating below 1!

Total disappointment."
Olive Garden,Rishabh Kumar,24 September 2018,4,"After a long time I was satisfied with any restaurant by their taste and quality too. I ordered Chicken kalmi kabab and Chicken boneless biryani. Kalmi kabab was awesome and juicy. I can see a perfect amount of spices are used in that dish and also the chicken meat was tender. Now if I judge their Chicken boneless biryani, it was also as good as Kalmi kabab. Chicken boneless biryani was served with raita and mirchi ka salan."
Olive Garden,Shail Choudhary,18 September 2018,4,"Been there twice, and I kinda like the place ..

Olive Garden,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),31 July 2018,3,"New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here."

We ordered schezwan chicken and corn palak roll for starters.. The Corn rolls were soo fresh.. It tasted amazing.. Chicken was spicy and nice too..

Veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. There was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. Taste was on another level.. Biryani was spicy.. A little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. But rest of the items compensated for this..

I highly recommend this place.. Will definitely visit again and again.. üòÑ

Olive Garden,Baishali Ghosh,27 July 2018,4,"FOOD:
The food was quite delicious.
I ordered oregano fish tikka, which was really nice.
I had also ordered egg spring rolls which were very tasty but I felt they could be crispier.
For main course, I had plain naan and dum ka murgh which went really well with the naan.

SERVICE:
Staff was very corteous and polite and very attentive. Plates were changed and food was continually served.
Also they support Amex, which was quite nice as I am unable to use my CC at a lot of restaurants.

AMBIENCE:
This is a nice place to come with family or group of friends. It is not very fancy but they have a private hall as well so if you're looking for a closed off area to dine, you have that option."

Tandoori Food Works,Gauri,12 May 2019,2,"Ordered chicken tikka from here. Never had itna oily chicken tikka in my life. The oil was dripping uncontrollably from the box, the packing was bad.

Tandoori Food Works,Vemula Sruthi,29 March 2019,2,Hi Team..I am big fan of your restaurant and I visit frequently..but unfortunately I have received wrong order I have ordered veg paneer biryani and food I received was chicken biryani..when I called your exceutive he just disconnected my call .can you at least listen to your customers concerns..
Tandoori Food Works,Ha,26 March 2019,3,"Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250/-. The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less. It just fills one person stomach, if someone's appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place.

There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!

Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve.

The Raitha was really tasty!! I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge."
Tandoori Food Works,Balu Krishna,23 March 2019,1,"Waste of money and worst taste I have ever tasted and very disappointed with Zomato again!!!

Switched off the mobile. I dont understand why do these restaurants provide their mobile number, if they dont have intention to respond to customers. In case of cancelling the order why should the restaurant accept the order first and y should they regret to decline the order that too after 45 mins."

Al Saba Restaurant,Srujin Rajan,29 April 2019,1,"Yet another Sunday evening.. It was quite late when I reached this place.. But it was not the time to shut down the restaurant as well.. It was shocking to see no one in the restaurant though..

Ambience was normal and there is nothing to hype about it.. The hotel is not kept clean.. Infact there was an insect in the plate that was given to my first and I had to change my plate eventually.. Service was pretty late considering the items that we ordered..

I ordered chicken majestic and egg biryani .. To be frank, the food was disastrous... U can't put the blame on the time i went as well because it was at 10 in the night.. The starter looked like gravy and tasted very and the briyani had no masala at all..

Starter : chicken majestic
Rice and biryanis : egg biryani

Ambience : 2
Food : 1
Service: 1
Value for money : 1

Bottomline : Not Again"
Al Saba Restaurant,Rajeshkanna K,11 April 2019,1,Mutton biriyani pieces were rotten. Don't know how old the meat was. And the ambience and cleanliness were disgusting. Save yourself don't try this hotel.
Al Saba Restaurant,Raj6305926107,09 April 2019,1,Chicken peaces in Egg biryani. No response from restauraunt end. Taste also very bad. Improve your service dont repeat this other customers.
Al Saba Restaurant,Akshay Kannolli,03 April 2019,5,I can say the best mutton dum biryani I have tasted In long time with great salan ! The flavours are perfectly balanced it was my first order though I have never had it before this so I will have it again in future to know if the consistency is the same !

Al Saba Restaurant,Sourav Roy,06 January 2019,3,The biriyani was great. But ambience is not that great. Crowded mostof the time. Good for parcel of food. U must order the mutton Biryani here. Service is quick though.

Al Saba Restaurant,Atulay Mahajan,01 November 2018,2,"Went there yesternight, just to have that hyped Irani Chai, but it will be safe to say that I was fairly disappointed. The tea didn‚Äôt taste that good as I had heard. Cups were dirty and the tea was spilled all over the saucer."
Al Saba Restaurant,ANKIT TRIPATHI,23 September 2018,5,"5 star Only for Irani chai and Osmania biscuits. Didn't tried any other thing.
Had Irani chai of many popular places in Hyderabad, but this place serves one of the best Irani chai. And about the Osmania biscuits, it melts into your mouth."
Al Saba Restaurant,Nikhil Mahale,09 September 2018,3,"They have really good bryani and starters. Overall food quality is good. We did not find the Whole wheat roties they are of mostly maida. Staff is good, they will help you in choosing the menus recomendations etc. We always feel comfortable to seat in AC room rather outside. Parking available. Location is easily reachable. Many times they do not accept the card payment so make sure you carry cash or they have ICICI ATM in front of cash counter."

Al Saba Restaurant,Zain,22 July 2018,1,"The food is ok. Could be better. But coming to customer service, I rate negative. The cashier‚Äôs behaviour is utterly distasteful. Constantly talking over phone without giving a rats ass to the customer. Behaviour of the restaurant managers doesn‚Äôt make the place seem safe especially when you‚Äôre with a lady. Very uncomfortable feel. Avoid it."

Al Saba Restaurant,Nurunnisa Shaik,16 June 2018,1,"Avoid this place for your lifetime if you want to stay healthy..!!! We have ordered Mutton Biryani and it had dead flies in it.. We thought it fell into the Biryani bowl while adding rice into it., but when my husband thoroughly checked the whole biryani we could easily see 3 within 3 minutes. We have complained about it to the waiter and waited for 15 minutes hoping someone will come and explain what went wrong."
Al Saba Restaurant,Kumar,16 June 2018,4,"I have been visiting this restaurant since 2010. I might not be able to comment on Veg section as I have never ever ordered any veg item. Non veg did not disappointed me till date no matter is it tandoori, grill or mutton biryani or Haleem. It will be one among the first choices for any non veg take away but one of the last among family dinning. As bachelors, Yes.. We can go in a ruff n tuff zone.Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5
Service : 4/5 (good but not great)Cost : 5/5 (I find it value for money)
Ambiance: 2.5/5"
Al Saba Restaurant,Hari Prasad Thangavelu,15 June 2018,3,"Have been to this restaurant many times. Taste wise, preferably better than all other restaurants (next to Shah Ghouse, I would say). Quantity wise, one biriyani will be more than enough. Chicken Biriyani with double masala would be a treat to taste buds. Go for it. The chicken would be damn soft and good. Starters like Pepper Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, all are good. They need to work more on ambiance as the place is not clean. Moderate pricing and enough number of items to go with."
Al Saba Restaurant,Sadiksharif,15 June 2018,1,"Found 2 dead flies in the biryani the other day my friend found an insect in the biryani!!! Avoid this place
Horrible place and it‚Äôs not good for your health!!! Management is not at all responding even after complaining the issue"
Al Saba Restaurant,Pavitra Mutyala,08 June 2018,4,"This place is best for ordering food and parcelling it.

Al Saba Restaurant,Ani Aliyas,16 April 2018,5,Visited more than 6 times... Biriyani taste is really good as usual. Properly cooked rich flavoured biriyani. Clean dining area and service is also good.
Al Saba Restaurant,Calming Storm,24 March 2018,2.5,"Went to this place after hearing great reports about its biryani. Tried chilly paneer(okay), veg biryani(okay), rumali roti, and kaju masala curry(bad). The ambiance is below average and serving is very bad."
Al Saba Restaurant,Arvind Varma,22 March 2018,4,Pretty decent taste of Biryani. I like this place as it is quick to serve and yet never loses its taste. I always have the chicken Biryani over here when I don't want to risk tasting anything new.
Al Saba Restaurant,Biswamit Dhal,12 March 2018,1,"Food quality is not good and the restaurant is also not clean at all.

Service is bad and they don't accept cards / Paytm.

Food: 1/5
Ambiance: 0/5
Service: 1/5

I don't recommend this place."
Al Saba Restaurant,Giri Talari,02 March 2018,3,"There was a lot of disturbance ,but running area service was good but ambiance was not good , money is sortable ,Biryani was not so good .Irani chai is good"
Al Saba Restaurant,Foodtrakar,01 March 2018,3.5,Ordered Al-saba special mutton biryani. The quantity was good enough for 2 people with large appetite. Mutton pieces were soft and the taste is really good. Got very less pieces and the Biryani is medium spiced. They charge 5% extra on bill if you pay by card. Service is good.
Al Saba Restaurant,The Big Tummy Review,02 February 2018,2.5,"Tried grilled chicken and mutton Biryani here.

The mutton Biryani was pretty good and the quantity was great.

Grilled chicken was really disappointing. It had very less flavor, the chicken was completely dry and did not feel fresh at all!"
Al Saba Restaurant,Biswajit,14 January 2018,2.5,"My friend too here for IRANI tea üçµ .
Though I did not had any food over her the tea was good I had been here 4 time only to have tea when ever i visit Hyderabad"
Al Saba Restaurant,Ranjith Chinni,24 November 2017,3.5,"Another place fo delicious Hyderabadi rum biryani and irani chai.
There are numerous places across city for dum biryani and this is one of thr best. Although the spices used and cooking process is same, every biryani in different in its flavour.
This is a pocket friendly place available late night.
Both Chicken and Mutton biryani are good and they also serve fish biryani here which is also a must try dish. Kebabs are also very good here.
Coming to ambience, its a huge place with chai cafe kind of ambiance but they also have AC hall for family section.
Service is the only terrible thing here. Even during the peek lunch time, they say biryani is over and fresh hundi is awaited, which is terrible.
I mostly do take away here which is a better option.

Taste: 4
Ambience: 3
Service: 3"
Al Saba Restaurant,Nadeem Shaikh,24 November 2017,3,"Usually visit this restaurant on Fridays for lunch with office buddies. The place is packed almost always at lunch time. The food is mostly try your luck kind of a thing can be extremely tasty one day or totally bland at times specially their mutton biryani and tandoori items .
Good value for money but surely needs to improve on customer service and consistency on quality."
Al Saba Restaurant,Patan,08 November 2017,4,Chicken biryani tastes awesome from al saba restaurant but the only think i dont like is there maintenance which is too bad otherwise its really tasty and worthy too..
Al Saba Restaurant,Ankit Garhwal,01 November 2017,4.5,"Visited here n had chicken biryani 5/5, kolhapuri chicken 4/5, butter naan 4.5/5.. must visit it if u wanna have a good gravy based n rotis..north indian mughlai.. service was quick.."
Al Saba Restaurant,Sanket Kulkarni,13 October 2017,3.5,Great quantity and good platting for my starters and other chicken dishes also good quality in tandoori they have to improve on the server and service too
Al Saba Restaurant,SONIYA SINHA,06 October 2017,3,"The place should be visited when only having good biryani is your priority and not the ambiance, hospitality or hygiene.

We visited the place with office colleagues for lunch. The food tastes average other than the Biryani which is simply awesome. We ordered tandoori chicken, chicken hariyali kabab, adarika chicken tikka, chicken & mutton biryani, double ka meetha. Had sweet paan in the end."
Al Saba Restaurant,Rajit Haridas,09 September 2017,3,Tea was good. Food was ok. Reliable if you work late hours or just want to catch up with friends late night. It's so evidently popular amongst the night crawlers :)
Al Saba Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,04 September 2017,2.5,"The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

Taste: 3
Service: 2
Ambience: 2
Value For Money: 2"
Al Saba Restaurant,Raveendra Medarametla,26 August 2017,3.5,"You might have heard about the really good biryani or the Haleem or the Irani chai of this restaurant... but I'm here to talk about this amazing paan they serve! This is one of the best paans you get in Hyderabad... this paan comes with really nice tasty filling that you would end up swallowing it completely üòÅ

If you have not tried the biryani try it and don't forget to end it with the Irani chai and the special sweet paan! It's just the perfect combination!"
GD's,Raghunath Veampati,12 May 2019,5,"One of the best innovative burger üçî concept.
The first bite when I had it was like how come I missed this kind of taste. Awesome must try cheers. I go with mercury burger üçî as I am a cheese üßÄ lover. üëåüèª"
GD's,Naina Bhardwaj,04 May 2019,4,"Must try place if you are very hungry late night ! Amazing burgers . Even their veg burger tastes so good .
Well my favourite late night joint for burgers"
GD's,MD Zubair AD,19 April 2019,3,Great taste but not worth it! There is not place for dinning. Open all night! Fresh! Can come with friends but not dinning as said! Was full of cheese!
GD's,Parijat Ray,31 March 2019,4,"This place is a roadside burger joint. Their million way burger is a must try. The chicken is grilled freshly in charcoal and is juicy, tender in texture."
GD's,Aditya Sood,31 March 2019,3,"I have taken 2 stars out only because of the time they took to make the burger. No doubt, the burger was very juicy and tasty but the time they took to make it was far too long."
GD's,Ashketh Tiwari,22 March 2019,5,"This is possibly the best burger place I‚Äôve eaten at in around in a long long time. Being a Hyderabadi you grow up to your local baker-uncle, then came McDonalds and other brands, which were good, but they didn‚Äôt feel quite homely and you couldn‚Äôt necessarily see the theatrics of your burger in the making.

GD‚Äôs is a place to go to have a gastronomic experience, not just in terms of the taste but also the theatrics.

The polite owner will always be around asking you about the burger and always taking care of anything the bakers want.

If you want to be more than just satisfied with your next burger, I suggest you stop by GD‚Äôs."
GD's,Sushmita Mandal,22 March 2019,5,An absolute pleasure! Right opposite to Dlf building. The guy makes sure to give your burger the exact time and patience needed to cook it to perfection. A delightful experience!
GD's,ClickEatXploreYo,21 March 2019,4,"#DoYouKnow? A burger is the short name but in fact called as Hamburger and if you lay down all the hamburgers eaten my Americans only in a year, it circles earth 32 times.!

So why Burger topic now? Because of my recent visit to ‚ÄúGD‚Äôs‚Äù opp DLF that offers quick bites like, sandwiches, hot dog, grilled chicken starters & most importantly their famous mouthful sized burgers.
Galaxy Burger, no wonder a fast selling pick for its grilled buns crammed with two layered cheesy juicy meat that over salivates your palate. Grilling bun might need a little tweak to avoid chewiness or I am that one unlucky chap! Followed by brilliant #CometTail hot dog with freshness in every bite and decent smokey #AtomicWings with a sweet-tarty (BBD sauce) finish (but a little over grilled).
Though many of them choose this place for their speciality Meat burgers they do have good coverage for Egg/Veg‚Äôetarians and heard #AntiMatter burger is a worthy try. Overall paid 480INR.

Value for money yet filling one soul comfortably are the key reasons which can potentially bring you again.

GD's,Farhad Tarapore,19 March 2019,3,"Ordered from this place since I was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger. They didn't disappoint. The Galaxy burger that I ordered was huge. The chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well. The only thing I didn't like (I'm a fussy eater) was that the chicken wasn't a breast piece or some sort of filet. It had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which I'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. A pounded chicken breast without all those ""things"" in between holding the flesh, would have been better. Ultimately I took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately. Taste was good though. 
Still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me..."
GD's,Sivaramakrishnan E,17 March 2019,5,The best steak burgers in Hyderabad without a doubt.Consistency to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù. The taste never alters. Highly recommend all meat lovers to sink their teeth into the juicy steaks
GD's,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,03 March 2019,3,"Have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to DLF, what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers, loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu.. ordered Galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection, the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique BBQ taste with chunky chicken pieces in it!!

On rush hours the service time can go lengthy, limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger, and is open all night!!

Feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by MNC""s and the taste maybe it's justified, and definitely it's a worth visiting place!"
GD's,Shreyasi Pal,02 March 2019,5,"Love their BBQ chicken and mercury burger . Though service is little slow and eating area is small , if you can manage to take away then this the best burger at its cost."
GD's,Sanaullah7k,23 February 2019,5,One of the best tasting burgers in Hyderabad. I have tried many burgers in Hyderabad but this place serves the best burger. The charcoal grilled chicken with cheese is very delicious.
GD's,Almas Khorrami,18 February 2019,4,Tried the Mercury burger üçî It is cheesy burger with chicken stuffing. It is a must try for burger lovers. The ambience is pretty cool to visit with friends. There no place to sit and eat. The burgers are too good
GD's,Sachit Anand,17 February 2019,5,"Big fat juice burgers, the best recommended are ‚ÄúMilky way‚Äù, ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù and ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù. Even other chicken dishes such as chicken wings and full bird BBQ are nice and tasty. Please go to the venue and order to enjoy 100% flavour and taste."
GD's,Uday Goud,12 February 2019,4,packing should have done in a box ...
GD's,Avinash,10 February 2019,1,Meat in the burger was little uncooked and hard to chew
GD's,Anudeep Patibandla,07 February 2019,5,I think it justifies its tagline worth the wait.They generally take around 15mins to prepare.prices were bit high.Its a place for a quick bite.
GD's,Nishanth Reddy,06 February 2019,3,"I‚Äôve been to this place on my friends suggestion. Ordered one single chicken burger I don‚Äôt remember the name exactly. The chicken is grilled to perfection. Chicken piece is enormous than burger, infact when you bite the burger its not the burger which goes into your mouth its the chicken which goes into your mouth first. They‚Äôve also stuffed alot of cheese into it. Good taste for a street level burger place but there is definitely scope for an improvement."
GD's,Vishal Pentakota,02 February 2019,5,Great place to enjoy #americanBurguers. My favorite is cosmic burger. I been recommending this places to all my friends. #goodfood #lovingit #sizzling
GD's,Jharna Karira,31 January 2019,5,"Ordered chicken milky way burger at 3am and realized McDonald's and burger king are nothing compared to this burger!
Can sleep with happy tummy!"

GD's,Sayar Ghosh Roy,24 January 2019,5,"Simply Awesome. Tried Milky Way, Mercury and Cosmic Burgers and the Comet Tail Hotdog. All of them tasted great. The chicken has a deep texture and a nice smoky feel. Do try out this place."
GD's,Monica Budhwani,20 January 2019,1,"The paneer sandwich I ordered was not even grilled properly, the filling was just too bland."
GD's,F For FOODIE,20 December 2018,4,Visited the stall of this outlet at IBS last month. Ordered veg burger and veg sandwich. The panner which was inbetween both burger and sandwich was awesome! Really loved it! Somewhere I felt the prices are bit on higher side and very less vegetarian optionsüòï
GD's,Salma 214,12 December 2018,4,Quite good for burger lovers. Worth the money and milky way is my best choice here. #foodlovers#nightfood#tasty#teamparties...one of the best burgers I had
GD's,Shrey Kohli,04 December 2018,2,Extremely spicy
GD's,Neeharika Jaiswal,04 December 2018,5,"Ordered the Cosmic Burger and the Comet Tail HotDog. 

Packaging - Great! Packed in aluminium foil wraps, the burger and the hotdog were neat and clean, without any spillage. 
Quantity - Abundant. I was literally full in half a burger!
Taste - Brilliant! The chicken was succulent, the fillings and veggies were fresh and crunchy and the bread was soft and melted in the mouth.

Would definitely re-order."
GD's,Hakaru Talang,29 November 2018,5,sandwich was nice
GD's,Prashanth Jayanand,25 November 2018,4,"Out of so many options available in gachibowli, this place is definitely a hidden gem! Limited options on the menu but almost all the non veg menu items are good. Recommendations would the half bird, chicken wings in starters, big bang and milkyway in burgers! Only drawback is if there are too many orders the chicken remains a little under cooked some times. Ask them not to hurry and take time, you will enjoy the dish."
GD's,Kunal Arora,24 November 2018,4,okay .. looks over priced to me.
GD's,Sunny Daniel,23 November 2018,4,A heaven for meat lovers. A perfect solution to your burger cravings. Their burgers are equally delicious and unique just like their names.. #milkywayLover
GD's,Purnima Singh,17 November 2018,5,Amazing burgers they have..you eat it once and you feel like having it more and more..I and my friends are delighted üòÄ the barbeque grilled chicken burger is a must try üòÄ
GD's,Prachi Opr,14 November 2018,5,Ordered the asteroid burger. And it was the best burger I've ever had in my life.Potato wedges crisp and spicy. The sauces were bang on.The melted cheese on a layer of seasoned veggies. The bread could have been slightly better.The main usp of this burger is that everything blended perfectly.Can't wait to try more of their burgers.
GD's,Shreyoshi Mandal,11 November 2018,4,"Got a Galaxy burger home delivered from this place for my lunch and I now I realise what all the hype is about! The burger is really finger licking good with ample amount of cheese and sauces.
Coming to the quantity I would suggest a single layered Cosmic burger would be good enough for a light - medium eater as this is extremely filling."
GD's,Sucheta Nalawade,05 November 2018,1,"I ordered parcel , instead on three layer cheese, they put only one piece cheese in burger- this happened twice with me... cheating with Customer who order online. Not happy :("
GD's,Slthakurr,22 October 2018,5,Really appreciate the service of the restaurant and the concerned behaviour of the owner for his customers. At first when I received the order the burger was cold due to late delivery but when I complained the owner personally called to me and apologised and repeated the order this time sending his own delivery person. And the burger was amazing. To the owner thank you for being so concerned. There are very few owners like you who make sure customer s are happy. Keep it up :)
GD's,Rohit Balakrishnan,17 October 2018,5,"After dandiya session , we decided to try this place near my hostel which is open till 3am or so.

Galaxy burger looked appealing as some else had ordered it before us. Tried it and fell in love.

Amazing taste , amazing value for money. Fresh buns, tasty chicken and they customise it to ur taste specifications"
GD's,Shilpa Sood,15 October 2018,1,"Pathetic experience! From packaging to the product itself, it failed to appeal to my hungry stomach. I gave up all my hopes when I received the burger like this. The experience of eating the burger itself was no surprise. I will not order from this restaurant ever again."
GD's,Abhishek Pradhan,15 October 2018,5,Awesome. They listend to my special request. I am a regular customer and they never disappoint.
GD's,Gv Sagar,10 October 2018,5,awsome food and nice delivary guy
GD's,Akshith,09 October 2018,4,"Cosmic chicken burger üçî
GD‚Äôs barbecues and burgers is a small shop located exactly opposite to DLF office here they serve juicy and tender barbecues and burgers.
The burgers made here are really good they marinate the chicken with desi spices and herbs, they cook the chicken in such a way that it is tender and juicy.
This is not a place where you can sit with your friends and have a bite I recommend this place only if you‚Äôre Street food lover and planning to grab something to eat on the go.
Each burger at this place costs around Rs.150-Rs.200.

Ambience ‚Ä¢7/10"
GD's,Karandeep,08 October 2018,4,"Big Bang
Three layers of BBQ chicken strips, a cheese slices and some lettuce. It's a nice tasting marinade but if only they didn't over cook it.
You keep the chicken juicy for that's what makes a burger. You'll need someone who understands the timing and temperature to keep the chicken juicy

Constellation
It's more of a mutton sandwich. Again the problem here is of over cooking. The mutton started to crumble while eating and the binding gave way.

Otherwise for a 2 am food cravings, this is one of the best places to go at."
GD's,Monica Reddy,08 October 2018,2,"Ordered a burger from this place and it is so disgusting to see a burger wrapped recklessly in an aluminium sheet deliver at my place. How can you wrap a burger in a sheet!?? By the time I opened the pack, the burger got compressed, cheese leaked all over the sheet.

The taste of the burger wasn‚Äôt good too. The bun didn‚Äôt seem fresh at all. I still don‚Äôt understand how this place has a 4.4 rating!?"
GD's,Pratyush Shrivastav,07 October 2018,5,"Best Burgers, as always."
GD's,Saheb Mondal,06 October 2018,4,It was typical GDs Hot Dog. Fresh chicken and perfect blend of all sauces and seasonings. Goes very well with a Fri/Sat night party. You will surely love it.
GD's,Vedant Killa,02 October 2018,4,"Having heard this name so often lately, we decided to order from here on a Sunday afternoon.

Quite a small place which is mostly suited for just delivery and not a quintessential dine-in. üòÄ

We ordered the Jupiter and Anti-Mater Burgers. Oh so amazing. Heavy filling, just the right amount of sauce and spice! Fancy names but the paneer filling was delicious.

I think we made a wise choice :)"
GD's,Thakur Smrati Singh,30 September 2018,5,This place is epic for anyone who wants to have a luscious juicy BBQ burger! There‚Äôs so much hype to this place and at first you may find 220rs for a Galaxy Burger (my personal fav) a little overpriced but trust me on this guys!! It‚Äôs totally worth it!! For all burger loves this is ‚Äúthe place‚Äù to go! üòÅ
GD's,Sthiti Chakraborty,29 September 2018,5,"Ordered cosmic and galaxy burgers from this place, the taste was distinctly different and delicious is an understatement. The chicken was tandoori style and not a patty so that was one new thing. It was juicy, cheesy and the bread was also fresh. This is the first Indianised burger I had and I am in love with it. The galaxy one of too much for one, it is that filling. The cosmic is also same to taste but can be finished by one. The packaging was good and simple, and the burgers were moderately warm when they were delivered. It was a very good experienceüòã please give this place a try."
GD's,Pathakastha666,24 September 2018,5,I have ordered home delivery from this place and i would definitely recommend their pole star burger. Yummy grilled chicken and oozing cheddar cheese. Absolutely delicious
GD's,Shraddha Singh,19 September 2018,4,"Ordered a Jupiter Burger from here and it exceeded my expectations ‚ù§Ô∏è
Had a nice layer of charred vegetables and layers and layers of cheese. The taste was brilliant and size was humongous. Thoroughly enjoyed this! Too good. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
GD's,Neelesh Agrawal,18 September 2018,3,"Ordered via Zomato. Poor packaging, the burger got squished. The chicken and sauces were quite tasty though.
The packaging should probably be in boxes."
GD's,Akansha Garg,16 September 2018,1,"Not a nice experience.
The burger had a grill impression but was not cooked and was raw...
The fried veggies was not having taste.
The dip was also not interesting"
GD's,Deepika Velivela,14 September 2018,5,"Best grilled chicken burgers in town! üòã
Found this place highly rated on tomato, so we decided to give it a try. And were completely impressed by the lip smacking Milky way burger.
The owner was a really cool person btw!"
GD's,Subhasis Chand,06 September 2018,5,GD's is just excellent...
GD's,Nitin Pandula,05 September 2018,5,Been there on a Sunday night for a quick snack and ordered Milky Way burger and Thunderstorm burger. These two burgers were different from each other in terms of texture.. Milky way had shredded chicken combined with creamy mayo and a cheese slice. This is a must have for anyone with a craving for cheesy and creamy burgers.. Thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. The burger just melts in your mouth.. Must visit place for bbq lovers..
GD's,Mohit Sharma,04 September 2018,2,it was not too good what I expected...lots of potato were there in stuffing..guys burger won't have potato too much
GD's,Pramit Bandyopadhyay,04 September 2018,5,"I ordered the Galaxy burger. Burger and dip was poorly packaged and squashed inside the single layer of foil. Could not find cheese inside the burger. Expected more chicken(it was advertised as ""double layered""). For the price I paid(235+delivery), I expected more. Burger was tasty.


edit: I am changing my rating to 5 stars. After talking to them, it seemed that this was an isolated incident of misbehaviour on the part of the delivery guy, and GD was in no way responsible for it. They apologized and gave me a free burger with the next order, which was in good condition and delicious."
GD's,Sonofepicurus,02 September 2018,5,"Now that s what we call some authentic chicken burger. They can give the big names like burger king and McD run for their money any fine day. These uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana. The soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masala(marinated ) are grilled till they turn golden brown. A double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger; which is my personal favouriteThe burger buns are soft and sweet.

They have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty. Basically their USP is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad. The place is in mid of bustling DLF area which makes the place pretty accessible. You may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty. Must visit place for mouth watering burgers."
GD's,Abhilash Pradhan (AbTheFoodie),31 August 2018,5,"A hidden jewel serving probably the best burgers in Hyderabad and that too at a steal of a price.

You probably wouldn't notice this joint infront of DLF Hyderabad but for the crowd that throng during evening hours . And if you have had a burger or a hot dog here and there's simply no place you can go to satisfy the cravings they create .

Do try their cosmic burger, paneer hot dog, paneer burger.

The sauces that they put with the cheese is lipsmacking.

I have been a fan and I'm a regular here. Try and you won't be disappointed.

GD's,Divya Thakur,29 August 2018,5,A little more spicy for a North Indian but amazing quantity and good quality. A simple burger is okay for your one time dinner.
GD's,Mad Max,25 August 2018,5,"One of the best grilled chicken that I've eaten in Hyderabad.
And yeah the name of the food is themed on Galaxy which is really pretty cool."
GD's,Ishna Rawlani,24 August 2018,4,"A hidden treasure, you have to travel across to eat these heavenly burgers. A small place situated in DLF,
GD's is a very renowned place famous among people who work in the IT hub and also students in the
same area. You can park your car, and explore this joyous ride. They have burgers like never before, all
named after the galaxy, stars and sky. GD is himself who got these after a lot of research and planned to
ditch his corporate job to start a journey with burgers, why? Because he absolutely loves them. When
you head there, place your order, it takes a min hiimum of 20 minutes for your burgers to arrive as they
prepare all fresh on the live grill in front of you. The burgers are vegetarian, chicken, paneer, fish and
more that is grilled to perfection and topped it with your chosen flavours off the menu. The bread is soft
and straight out of the oven. They also have sandwiches, starters and hotdogs! Try the Mercury, it‚Äôs all
chicken strips with melted Creamy cheese, the perfect burger for a rainy day. The Venus if you are a
lamb fan, or the Milky Way if you love chicken with a lot of Mayo. They also have Neptune, made in
Ferrero nuts, chicken and cheese. There is a special dip you will be served with and it‚Äôs out of the world!"
GD's,Prabhat Dhulipudi,19 August 2018,5,So me and my friends always visit this place after watching a movie. They serve the best burgers at midnight. My personal favourite is milkyway. Do visit if u want eat burgers at a cheaper price.
GD's,Anil Kumar,18 August 2018,5,"Awesome burgers , chicken they serve is very good and mouth watering and the bread is little slippery but the chicken compensate it and best burger"
GD's,Praful,14 August 2018,4,"I ordered twice from here. Both times the meteor burger with extra cheese. The burger consistency isnt exactly top notch, but the burger is tasty. The bread keeps slipping and breaking but like i said earlier it tasted good so i am gonna let that slide lol"

GD's,Grk Sumanth,30 July 2018,4,"This happened on a pleasant üåá while I decided to have a burger. I have ordered a galaxy burger which has charcoal fried wings/breast pieces to my bewilderment I found charcoal + charcoal fried üêì like embedded javascript in Static HTML page üòÇ so, I would like to recommend this place if you don't have charcoal in your toothpaste they will give FREE charcoal in burger, u can later apply paste and brush your teeth I can personally assure you it is of the best quality probably the coal Gd's use has better quality than that used in coal power plants and post washing your teeth with toothpaste you can save electricity, wondering how? Just open your mouth it instantly becomes a bulb and one more thing which saved me, while I was on a pitch black road three men approached inorder to mugg as soon as I opened my mouth they ran away the luminosity of my teeth was around the same as the sun's.P.s: I used pepsodent for better results P.s.s I used this super power on my solar water heater.
+4 for Mr. GD who took my experience and resolved it üòä"
GD's,Ankit Anand,29 July 2018,5,Very good
GD's,Anudeep Krovi,28 July 2018,5,"Venus. Hand down the best burger I have ever eaten. Finger licking food. Takes a little bit of time to cook the food but it's totally worth the wait. The spicy minced mutton patty with cheese inside, on top and melting from sides is just heavenly. The pepper bites with egg and minced chicken are to die for. Just go to this place and enjoy the best food in town."

GD's,Prabhjit Thind,23 July 2018,1,Delivery boy hasn't reached yet. Told me to come downstairs(where I live) before even reaching. Now he's giving excuse that he'll be late by 10min. DISGUSTING

GD's,Divya,21 July 2018,2,not as expected
GD's,Lalitha,20 July 2018,2,I ordered veg berger. But the bun is so hard that it spoiled the taste.
GD's,Rituparna Bhattacharyya,20 July 2018,3,"this time, taste was good, but the bread became sogy with the mayo/cheese and started to break after few bites. I suppose that needs to be considered"
GD's,Arun J,19 July 2018,4,Hot dog was good. Burger got squeezed during delivery.
GD's,N. Rahman,19 July 2018,5,"One of the best burgers and grilled food items I've ever had.. Kudos!

GD's,J K,17 July 2018,5,awsome
GD's,Aakhil Akram,17 July 2018,2,No napkins provided n all the sauce was coming out already... Packing was poor n cheap... Not so satisfied even with the taste
GD's,Avikal31saxena,16 July 2018,4,burgers were very good and the hotdog was also nice. The chicken was succulent and very juicy. I like the prepration. Thank you
GD's,Rituparna Bhattacharyya,16 July 2018,2,the item was not fresh prepared
GD's,Supraja Sweety,15 July 2018,5,good
GD's,Putha Pavan,13 July 2018,5,The best place to have a burger is GD‚Äôs. Milky Way burger is the must try dish as the cheese flows between the burger and the bbq chicken slice is awesome and mouth watering!
GD's,Santosh,13 July 2018,1,the bun is not fresh.. the burger was moist and wet
T Grill,Harshet Agarwal,04 May 2019,2,"the rating is such because of the name
we had thought it was like an american grill restaurant
shocked by the indian spread 
food was ordinary 
no choice in red meats and no grill
pls change the name, gives out the wrong idea"
T Grill,Nishanth Reddy,03 May 2019,4,"I was on a work in financial district and it happens to be lunch time, so finalised this place after some search, i parked my car outside and walked inside it was completely empty, as i enter into AC dining hall, man o man full of crowd, I literally waited for 15 minutes to find a table, as the staff is completely busy with existing orders not the new customers, so yeah, service needs to be improved. After finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i‚Äôll try some more. Recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover."
T Grill,Gopinath Mamidi,25 April 2019,4,"Good out door sitting restaurant to spend some pleasent evening time. Visited this place which to close to outer ring road and nankaramguda IT offices. It's a quite and less crowded to have Andhra style spicy food. We ordered babycorn manchuria, chicken lollipop and chicken biryani. Food was bit spicy but manageable and good. Chicken was well cooked and tasty. Quantity was bit less when compared to it's price range and it's compititers. But still it can be miantained well

Quality: 4/5
Quantity:3/5
Price range : 3.5/5 (5 means it's costly)
Service:3/5
Taste:4/5
Ambiance:4/5 (for outdoor sitting)"
T Grill,Harish Reddy,23 April 2019,4,"I just love this place. Good Ambience, it is very pleasant in the evening. Away from the traffic and crowd, it's a great place to organize any events especially in the lawn area. The lighting adds to the elegance."
T Grill,Kiran Singh,19 April 2019,5,"The food is amazing good value for money, ambiance is beautiful, a good place to hangout, a must visit restaurant, a perfect place for friends and family"
T Grill,Vishnu,17 April 2019,1,"Useless.. They serve alakarte items as ""prasadam"" and empty customer pockets. It's not worthy. Quality and quantity is poor. Once you visit then you will never visit there in your life time. I dont recommend other customers to go here. Jaagao grhak jaago.."
T Grill,Simi Reddy,09 April 2019,5,"Since this place is close to my office and they serve South Indian delicacies, I‚Äôve decided to go there with my team. This place has got that simple dhaba vibe and the food they serve is lip smacking. If you are non-vegetarian, this place is a must try. Also, if you are here- do eat their Kadhu ka kheer in desserts. Ever since I‚Äôve tried that, I ensure that I order this every time I go there and recommend this to friends and this one has never let us down."
T Grill,Radhika Burra,08 March 2019,3,"Me & my friend we're looking for quick lunch on a Friday noon in Financial Dist and we spotted this place. Decided to venture as this will be our first visit.

It's was exactly at 12.30 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one. Outside landscape, place for sitting is very good. There is in-house place with AC as well. We chose inside as it was already too hot. Ambience is descent and nothing very special, but is good.

Food we kept it simple as Nawabi Chicken Kebab which was special on the day we visited and Chicken Biryani. Kebabs were really nice. Biryani was like fine. Not so very delicious at same time it's not bad. Service is fast.

While if you ask me will you visit the place again, I might start thinking as I found place outside more interesting than the food. That does not serve purpose. So, I am sure you got answer.

Interesting was by time the clock ticked 12.45noon, my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we're waiting... That made us think, probably there is something else special about this place which we didn't order... So if at all I go there next time will see to it I taste it... üòÄ"
T Grill,Cadeepthichowdary.raavi,26 February 2019,3,"We always use to order their kodi pulav (which tastes sooo good few times and just okay some other times) on zomato but recently we visited this place to have dinner

So we ordered chicken manchow soup which was okay okay in taste cuz manchow noodles are not fresh since i could smell the oil in noodles... but quantity of chicken in soup was good !

Kothimeera kodi pulav (suggested by the server) is actually pretty tasty but i wish there was little more kothimeera in it ... taste was very good though..prices are little high"
T Grill,Kiran Valipa,14 February 2019,4,"T-Grill is on the main road next to ICICI campus in the Financial Dist, spread over an acre it has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures.

We started with Grilled fish that was Basa/Cod fillet skewered upon coals; it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney. The Paya shorba/soup was extremely spicy but very tasty.  Then we had Kottimira Chicken, Mutton Dalcha with Bagara Rice for the main course that came as a recommendation. Pachipulusu with the Bagara Rice also tasted awesome. On the whole, all the dishes we tasted there were awesome except for the heat from the spice!

Authentic Telangana and Andhra Signature dishes! Will definitely try again for the rest of the menu recommendations!"
T Grill,Sumeet Rastogi,10 February 2019,1,"Third class attitude, rude staff, pathetic food is what defines this place. Good luck if you happen to stall here by mistake.

A basic order takes more than half hour. Food lacks taste and staffs think they are over qualified for the job they are doing."
T Grill,Dinesh Pattanayak,04 February 2019,1,This restaurant never fails to dissapoint me. This time Ordered chicken biriyani from Zomato and this is what I got just bones and fragments . Upon complaining to the restaurant manager made fun of me saying I am trying to con him as I might have already finished the chicken or hidden it and now trying to get more for free. Asked me to complain in Zomato and that's exactly what I am doing.
T Grill,Kakani Raghavendarrao,03 February 2019,3,"I have been here for a team lunch with my colleagues.The ambience is different one and very nice place to hangout with friends.The food they served had excess oil ,be it veg or non veg .if you are a spicy food lover ,then this will disappoint you."
T Grill,Vishnu Brahmandam,01 February 2019,3,"This place is not exactly vegetarian-friendly. They cook everything in the same dish and I'm guessing they use the same oils. Did not eat here but thought people would like to know.
Service is quick for the starters. They took some time for the main course.
Friends say the food is alright.
There's outdoor and indoor seating. Place is clean throughout and it looks like the hygiene is good.
Gets really busy in the afternoon because it's so close to the IT hub."
T Grill,Srilekha Gattu,31 January 2019,1,Went for lunch on that day . I order veg biryani but found insect in it . Worst service . It was totally bad experience . Ambience is not good
T Grill,Rita Singh,08 January 2019,3,"Pretty good ambiance. Very spacious and huge one.

Food is amazing except the oil quantity that they use. Prawns dishes were not that great. Only prawns starter i.e golden prawns were good.

Gongura chicken is amazing.

Service is very fast.

Would not recommend lassi at this place as its not the proper one. It's very watery and tasteless.

Management is pretty cool and open to feedback...they humbly accepted the fault in dishes and replaced them.

Can be improved a lot. Would surely pay a visit again."
T Grill,Bhanu Chandar,03 January 2019,2,i went today at lunch time. service is very bad they dont now how to treat customer. They will not suggest what is the special today. Taste is good but improve Ur service. service is very slow i call many times to the service boy but he is not responding proper. hotel environment is good and taste is awesome. but i will not satisfy the service.
T Grill,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,30 December 2018,4,"One of the best places I have been to this winter, perfect ambience and what I loved the most was
to beat the cold they provide a hot charcoal basket beside every table..gives you the perfect winter warmth, even on a busy day of the week the service was on spot, just like a Dabha where everything seemed to be on the move and full of buzz üôÇ the food was always known to be typical Telangana food but somehow felt it was a little close to Telangana cusine and more of a quick Dabha serve..loved the ragi sangati combo perfect bowl of rangi sangati with a dollop of ghee with 4 accompaniments like mutton pickle, chicken curry, daal and pachi pulusu, ordered their famous pulavs as well.

Ambience : 4.5 (stole my heart with the charcoals)
Taste : 3.5 (would love more authenticity)
service: 4
Quantity : 3 (can improve a little for the price point)
Value for money : 3 (maybe because it is located in Gachibowli)

Overall rating for this place a decent : 4/5"
T Grill,Pradeep Koney,29 December 2018,5,Peaceful ambience and good food. Will be crowded over weekdays as it is close to multiple IT Companies. Food arrives suprisingly faster and tastes good too.
T Grill,Bharat Kumar,26 December 2018,4,"Great place to dine with and enjoyed the ulavacharu chicken pulao, tastes good. It's a perfect venue to enjoy some of the special Andhra dishes with a starry night view. It has a beautiful ambiance and wanna visit again."
T Grill,Sandhya Menon,24 December 2018,1,"I was looking forward to have good time & enjoy some good tandoori food. I liked this place with my previous experience have been very good.So was looking forward for the same. Reached this place, got a seat which had full of mosquitoes.I can't argue much of it as it was a open space, but they dint attempt to place a mosquito coil. The service guy was least attentive. We needed to search him to place the order .So ordered tandoori chicken boneless, harabara kebab n veg pulav.The very first bite but tears in my eyes as it was very very very spicy & harabara kabab's spice level so beyond my imagination.We just couldn't eat it. We asked them no make the pulav least spicy. But this one was like a bomb. We all went to have a good time but dint get anything of this sort. Will never try this place again. Spice lovers, I guess this place is for you."
T Grill,Kaushik Padmanaban,09 December 2018,5,"My friend ordered the Ulavacharu Chicken Bone Pulao from T-Grill. The price was high, but the taste justified it. It is one of the spicier foods I tried in Hyderabad. I always though Hyderabadi food was spicy. But, I never came across anything very spicy. This one was spicy enough to be memorable. It's one of the best pulaos I've ever had. You will definitely love it."
T Grill,Satya Kiran,25 November 2018,2,"Restaurant with lot of open place and average food. Went with friends for lunch, what ever we ordered Veg or Non veg, started , main course all are not upto mark. No one of us r happy with food served. Serving is fast, ambience is ok."
T Grill,A K RAJEEV,08 November 2018,5,Delivered on time and the food is very tasty and good quality. All the items taste good and even the kids enjoyed the food.  Overall the food is very good
T Grill,Raghunath Veampati,04 November 2018,2,"I recommend it for elderly.
Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è with taste have tried starter, roti & biryani. Taste so so normal
But every dish is less in masala and has below normal taste
Not a good place for hangout"
T Grill,Bhuvanesh Durai,31 October 2018,3,seemed like the biryani was over cooked
T Grill,Rmandava70,29 October 2018,4,"Ordered Ragi Sankati and Kodi kura. Unlike other speciality restaurants, the preparation is mild, less spicy and less masala. Loved the taste. Ordered curd rice which actually is not good. They should look into it. Overall nice dining place in that part of Hyderabad."
T Grill,Santosh Vadapally,13 October 2018,4,quantity of biryani is very less
T Grill,Sharon Kudari,29 September 2018,5,"Wonderful food, especially grilled ones. Awesome place to escape city environment and have pleasant evening without traffic. #grilledchicken"
T Grill,Suneel Jammu,23 September 2018,5,Good
T Grill,Ursnayana,21 September 2018,1,"Biryani taste is not at all good.
Biryani taste is not at all good.
Biryani taste is not at all good.
Biryani taste is not at all good.
Not worth the price. Rice over cooked. All the food is gone to trash."
T Grill,Ashesha,21 September 2018,1,"Very very very very disappointed. We ordered kadai paneer, its a disaster . Instead they gave us tomato curry with few paneer pieces in it. Please DONT order food from this place. Mutton Biryani is a big flop."
T Grill,Venkatdanda01,17 September 2018,3,quantity less
T Grill,Shruthi Gopala,09 September 2018,1,"Ordered Kadai cheken but worest

T Grill,Aditi Saxena,09 September 2018,5,awesome food
T Grill,Shahed Khan,07 September 2018,5,Good service And on time delivery...!!!! keep up the gud work Rehman.
T Grill,Powlomi Renukunta,07 September 2018,4,"Great place to have a peaceful lunch with a gang of 3,4 people. It has a pleasant atmosphere with both indoor and outdoor seating, in which the outdoor one is the real fun. Place is quiet neat and clean. It also has Telangana style.

Food here is just average not great. Service need to be improved a bit. We were there waiting to order but no one turned to take the order. Ordered veg Manchuria, appollo fish, kaju paneer ,kulcha. All of them very ok but not great."
T Grill,Saikiran Boorgoju,01 September 2018,1,Worst mutton biryani(uncooked n without) I ever tasted and restaurant should feel shame to serve spoiled kheema pulau. I recommend don't go to this place at all
T Grill,GAUTHAMI VARRE,31 August 2018,1,"We ordered keema pulao n Britain n paneer in veg..Both of them tasted like flavoured rice with semi cooked pieces.
Even kadai paneer gravy was not well cooked.

Restaurant ambience is also not so gud"
T Grill,Pallavi,20 August 2018,4,"Been here for dinner. They have both open air and restaurant style sitting. We opted for open air. The ambience is dull. Could be more brighter. The food service was fast. Prices are reasonable. The quantity for biryani/pulao is sufficient for 2. The food is a bit spicy. Taste is good.

Ambience 3/5
Food 4/5
Price 4/5
Service 3.5/5"
T Grill,See Hari Teja,15 August 2018,5,"Super b biryani and also paya is awesome here and coming to non veg starters you will love it great taste with the cool environment ...

You should try

Mutton paya
Non veg starters
Biryani and also pulao will be great than biryani"
T Grill,Satya Todeti,11 August 2018,1,Worst and worst biryani everrrrrr ..... Don't order and you will get food poison. Don't ever order Worst and worst biryani everrrrrr ..... Don't order and you will get food poison. Don't ever order Worst and worst biryani everrrrrr ..... Don't order and you will get food poison. Don't ever order
T Grill,Shiva Ram,08 August 2018,3,"Visited for dinner. Service is good, ambience make you to feel free.Ordered soup chickenSarter, bagara rice,Kodi kura all are satisfactory.price ok."
T Grill,Amruta Srinivasa Gupta Boyina,02 August 2018,1,The Hotel is Full cheating we are very much disappointed . It is Not worth going . Buffet is Full cheating we are fed up  . The varities are less and The Buffet is Like alakarta . Food is also so so
T Grill,Kundhan Reddy,31 July 2018,5,"I have to say.. TGrill has the best menu...
The non-vegetarian items are awesome
And the taste is also good..
I'm impressed.
Thank you Nithin bro! :)"
T Grill,Avishek Bera,28 July 2018,1,"Ordered chicken biryani from this place...worst biryani I ever tasted in my life. I never expected such tasteless biryani from a place like this in Hyderabad. If you are looking for good food, you must avoid this place."
T Grill,Siddharth Boddupalli,22 July 2018,4,"This is it! If you're in the mood for some telengana good, head here. Keep in mind that their biryani is just about average of not meeehhhh.... But the rest of them daily specials are so so so delish and spicy..... Really spicy but, You'd be licking your fingers.

I've not seen anyone come here to try their Chinese and vegetarian as I don't think it would stand out at all. But again, their bheja fry, their iguru, their kheema and the meats that they have are amazing!!! Their bagara rice along with the kheema and mutton iguru was too too good.

I'll definitely give them a try again at least to check out the daily specials."
T Grill,Ankit Aggarwal,20 July 2018,1,"It amazes me to see the current rating of the restaurant on Zomato. The taste of food, service and unhygienic food/ambience describes a holistic and gloomy conditions of the restaurant.
The food quality has degraded with time. I would never visit it again."
T Grill,Ajay Ratho D,18 July 2018,3,"Restaurant Food Ambience weather was sexy it was drizzling when I visited Drizzle made more exciting ü§©üòç All Were Good Except Staff I almost waited 30 mins for Food
Though I liked The Place üòä"
T Grill,Trishna M,08 July 2018,3,"Ordered a nice dinner for two from T Grill. The prices are mediocre and I placed my order late night via Uber Eats. Following is my experience-:

Service- The parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. The delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5

Presentation/Packaging- It was a usual packing. Nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5

Food- Food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. We tried the following-:

Paneer Pulao- It had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. There were average number of paneer pieces. It tasted quite yum. The masala was ample inside. Too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5

Gobi 65- A good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried Gobi. Nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5

Will I order from here again? I will only if they decrease the spice level. Despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water."
T Grill,Sayir Ashai,28 June 2018,4,"Nice place for lunch around Financial district.
I visited with my team and tried their biryani and kebab. Both were good.
Food here is spicy and tasty but don‚Äôt expect much on the ambiance.

Nice place to eat around IT Hub."
T Grill,Kiran Thota,26 June 2018,4.5,"awesome place to be during evenings, must try kunda biryani it was well cooked nonveg starters and this place has a good ambience, outdoor seating is nice."
T Grill,Chanda,23 June 2018,4,"Food was good , tried biryani and prawns dishes both are good , nice garden ambiance , service was good but waiting time wasnbit high compare to other restaurants"
T Grill,Ramaiah Chowdary,22 June 2018,1,"One word YUKk !!! Uncooked, smelly grilled prawns , tasteless chicken biriyani ( both kunda & dum) served by dumbest waiter B NARASIMHA . When reported the quality gave irresponsible responses that he only serves and doesn‚Äôt bother about anything else."
T Grill,Yash Paradkar,20 June 2018,4,"Great place to have lunch or dinner with a group. Great atmosphere and you get a feeling of being close to nature, as everything has a tribal-like theme. Also, indoor seating is available, but the outdoor one is the real deal here.

Though the food is pretty much average, nothing great. Do note that waiting times are huge, and it's better for groups than just 2-3 people."
T Grill,Veda,15 June 2018,5,"This place is the best bet for authentic telengana house old favourite Bheha fry, kodivepudu and kheema pulaov. Why do you need posh indoor ambience when you can munch on tasty bites under the moon. This was one of them were we dint have to wait for the serving and friendly staff.Loved food and the quiet and pretty decent setting. If you dont mind spending a few bucks its a must for quick bite!"
T Grill,Yugandhar Uddanti,13 June 2018,5,"As far as i can remember this is the best chicken pulao i ever had.
The sole reason im stll writing is because zomato wouldn't let me finish in 60 words."
T Grill,AmitKumar,12 June 2018,2,Average food. Bad service. Open place and good to sit outside and eat on a breezy night but not enough to visit again due to the food quality and service.
T Grill,Aditya Arthas,11 June 2018,5,"Really amazing place to hang out with friends and family. Ambience is perfect for clicking decent pictures. Definitely, a treat to the taste buds!"
T Grill,Farooq Shaik,06 June 2018,2,"Bad ambience, ok food.  Soups were great. Had some non veg starters which were not very tasty and felt a bit raw.  Naans and curry was nice. Horrible biryani. Roaches in sink  :x"

Can improve the ambiance by keep it more clean and decorative."
T Grill,Amarender Reddy Godala,10 May 2018,1,"It used to be good, since last few months food quality and quantity changed. They will serve any grass in the name of palak.. not suggestable at all.."
T Grill,Srini Vas,10 May 2018,4,"A decent place to get away from the crowded restaurants. This restaurant is an open type one on a sprawling area . I would suggest going for dinner and not for lunch as these are hot summers. we were 4 of us our family. ordered natu kodi biryani, butter nan and paneer butter masala . the taste was good. portion size ok. Food is expensive relatively. but the cool breeze and the ambience made up for it and we enjoyed the night."

T Grill,Arun Tej,30 April 2018,2,"Went there the other night with a couple of friends for dinner and I was truly disappointed. The food didn‚Äôt taste really well and the ambiance wasn‚Äôt great too. The rice was polished a bit too much and the Pulkas felt like papad. Had good expectations from Kothimeera chicken but it was all bland. On top of all of these, the waiters demanded for tip. Yes, they demanded how much tip we leave."
T Grill,Sandeep Patel,25 April 2018,4,I could have given a 5 but then cleanliness could be improved especially in lunch timings ... a regular visitor only because they have the best ribs in town ... ummmm they just melt in your mouth ! Awesome spicy food a good ambience... place has potential üëç
T Grill,Akshara,16 April 2018,1,recently had chicken biryani.and natukodi vepud .... It's horrible experience.... Food was ok ok ...m but coming to hygiene level it was totally disappointed .... Table was not at clear asked the two times for clean plate ........
T Grill,Bahul Bijji,12 April 2018,5,"We went to T-Grill yesterday for lunch overall experience was very nice. food , service, ambience and location everything was very good. Nice place to hangout with friends & family."
T Grill,Moula Basha,11 April 2018,1,star is only for ambience and average food . here they also serve food which is cooked one day before. I got served raw biryani and kababs .. food is not fresh
T Grill,Love Gupta,08 April 2018,3,The food quality is not that greay but a good place to go and hangout with friends. They have a good area for kids to play. The food can be improved and the service needs to be improved.
T Grill,Vakul Vankadaru,04 April 2018,5,"Best mutton biriyani I ever had, Also try fish its the best, from the first time I tried biriyani here I always ask when people suggest restaurants is it better than Tgrill or not.

Regularly order from here"
T Grill,Rajesh Krishnan,27 March 2018,5,"A randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch. we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave. But the moment I opened what seemed like a kitchen door, I was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some South Indian meat. Man, this place is an oasis in the Puppalguda desert!
We being mutton lovers, ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops. looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli. Our eyes shone. The nalli did not disappoint us. we then dug into the chops. all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on YouTube were redeemed. this mutton chops did the deed. the meat wasn't the slimy, fatty kind melting off the bones, but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort. we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies. then came the main course - rotis, mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani. first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet. we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi. for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys, this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour - a bit more sour and I wouldn't have cared to write this review. the meat was invisible. we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton. it was just mystically Omni present in the meat. I guess this is what you would call divine food.
amen."
T Grill,Itz Sai,17 March 2018,4,Been here multiple times and the food is always good..very good ambience in the evenings..only issue is their food is spicy even after u mention it to be low spicy..
T Grill,Raghunatha Reddy Ontikommu,15 March 2018,3,"On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park, had a stop here for lunch. I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. First impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
Huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. Initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available.
So shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. Our order was Veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. Jumbo chicken Biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, Mutton Biryani is good.
Service lag, may be of huge rush. Missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
Village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. May be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. Anyway no thrill at T grill."
T Grill,Neha Aggarwal,15 March 2018,2,A different place which used to serve finger licking food. Service is very slow. Only instant ice cream is amazing. I can give 5 stars to the Ice cream.
T Grill,Vemulapalli Sharmista,14 March 2018,4,Good place to hangout with large number of people.Service was good and fast.Fine and nice dining place.Menu has the regular cuisine and which has a great taste as well.
T Grill,Manoj Atmakuru,03 March 2018,4,Good place to pass time with buddies in the open air varandah restaurant. Ulavacharu Veg Pulao and Kaju Masala are my favourites here. Service takes time during daytime as it‚Äôs the most happening place around the IT corridor.
T Grill,Nabh Singhal,21 February 2018,3,"A different kind of taste for chicken lovers,veg is not that good,one time visit is not bad idea and it has huge open space for dining and staff is also co operative."
T Grill,Akanksha Prakash,16 February 2018,1,"Horrible service , Tasteless food, poor service, worst ambience ,Too costly,Will never visit again to this restaurant.Veg and Non-veg food both are worst"
T Grill,Thanoj Katepally,20 January 2018,2.5,Yesterday we had lunch at T-grill. We ordered chicken wings and panner kabab. Chicken wings were good and panner kabab was just okay. Naan and panner butter masala is good. We ordered chicken biryani and it was substandard and we are disappointed. Ambience is good for night dinner.
T Grill,Sudheer Reddy,04 January 2018,2,"Firstly this restaurant is very untidy and noisy. The ambiance was the worst and it is crowded and untidy place. So couples who want to have a good time please stay away.

However the food was ok. You can visit this restaurant once to just have a taste of the dishes. I still wonder why most people prefer t-grill despite all its negatives. üëé

Overall rating: 2/5 (just ok)
Taste of food: 3/5 (average)
Ambience and cleanliness: 1/5 (worst)
Service: 2.5/5 (below average)

Thank you üôè for reading. Please follow me so that you won‚Äôt miss my latest reviews."
T Grill,Arpita Sarkar,22 December 2017,2,Worst experience in sense of service. We came to this place group of 9 people. They were taking forever to take the orders. We received piece of hair in one of the starter. We had to seek the people to take our orders. Quantity of all the starters was very less. Every time we needed to ask them to serve. They were leaving the starters just like that on table. All the dishes were average or can rate them below than that as well. None of them was extraordinary. Waiting for main course was more than 30 mins.
T Grill,|| Viharika Rathode ||,19 December 2017,4,"It‚Äôs situated after icici building,spread into huge place .
Went for lunch here, ordered Masala Kulcha tasted ok, Murgh Malai Kebab was good and kheema Pulao , which was special dish that day , was good , but it‚Äôs always crowded due to the offices nearby ."
T Grill,Meher Chaitanya,16 December 2017,3.5,A good place for some Telangana taste! The grill items are really good. The biryani here is tasty and prepared with good ratio of rice meat and spices in perfect proportion! A little above budget pace but a good place to hangout with a projector and some bonfire under shacks
T Grill,Ranjith Regulla,15 December 2017,2.5,"I  went with my office team and was disappointed with the cost and food taste.

We tried Mutton Kunda Pulav and it costed us 349 INR but was not worth it. and taste was not that awesome.

Ambiance was good though ."
T Grill,Raghu,05 December 2017,3,"Located near Varun motors,
Been to this pace for lunch,
Place is huge with good outdoor seating.
Ordered chicken corn soup, boneless chicken kebab, chicken and mutton biryanis.
Chicken corn soup is ok.
Chicken kebab, soft and tender, tastes good, which is worth a try.
Mutton biryani is ok.

Cons : no proper service and waiting time is more.

Overall ok."
T Grill,Tarun Digavalli,03 December 2017,2.5,"Heyy veggies!! Good ambience!!
Food I should say is not so appealing...very tough to recommend or think of any standout...Butter Roti is good in breads
Service is good I should say...
Let's talk about Don't Trys:
Manchow Soup
Mushroom Starters (as a mushroom fan..disappointment)
This place would be in my choices with hangouts as priority and not food"
T Grill,Krishnamraju Maladi,27 November 2017,3.5,"Great ambience and hut style .....Ragi mudda combo was so tasty and fish is awesome ........Must go with family ..,...............
..



........."
T Grill,Darshana Krishnadas,26 November 2017,4.5,"Had heard a lot about the place. So finally decided to make a visit specially because it was quite close from our place. It's very spacious with lot of fresh air and tables at quite a distance from each other. The staff is very courteous and quick.

Now coming to the food the paya soup was horrible, but the staff was quick to replace it and suggest a better option which was really good.
Nice rotis and tasty biryani. The star of the evening was the methi chicken. Extra ordinary flavour and a very different taste. Definetly to be tried.

One place on my list which I know is reliable."
T Grill,Shiva Mysore,14 November 2017,4,"They have the best Andhra Cuisine in Hyderabad. I couldn't try much tasted Mutton Seekh Kebab and Mutton biryani. Mutton was cooked properly you can feel the aroma and softness while eating. The ambience is great and prices on menu are reasonable to try once in a time.

Happy Eating!"
T Grill,Jagannath Rao Bandari,01 November 2017,4.5,"Good food, value for money. We need not wait for much long after the food order, it's really fast. Good place for people how want spicy food, if u ask they would less it's as per ur requirement."
T Grill,Roshni Aftab,15 October 2017,4.5,"Went here for a team party, the food was top notch and tasted quite different from the usual ones. If you are looking for a change for your taste buds , go for T Grill.
The service can be improved a bit. Otherwise everything is perfect .

P.S.: This place is not for you if you aren‚Äôt a fan of spicy food. :p"
T Grill,Candana Rudroju,02 October 2017,1,Very bad restaurant. Wast of money and worst quality of food especially Birney and starters its better to go to buffet abs with that money. Worst quality of food
T Grill,Santhosh Reddy V,02 October 2017,1,"It‚Äôs a disaster.
Worst food ever.
Too costly for the worst food.
All the chicken curries are worst and never recommended for anyone..
Worst experience ever"
T Grill,Ajay,01 October 2017,4,"Great value for money spent. Natural ambience, felt happy spending the time.

Loved itüëå

#Eat what you can"
T Grill,Alnick Bryan,14 September 2017,4.5,I can't explain the feeling i felt when I started eating the two most beautiful things that exist in this world: Butter Naan and Kothimeera chicken.
T Grill,Chandan Mashetty,17 August 2017,3.5,"Been here with my team mates..chicken kebab, chicken drumsticks like tangdi kebabs, fish kebab was all very tasty and good..chicken biryani was not that great ..it was ok .
Overall a nice place for starters !!
Outside sit out place is good than inside ..üòâ"
T Grill,Jitendra Kumar,16 August 2017,5,"Lovely place to dine. On my day off I often visit there, they serve good briyani. Their staff know well about their food and portion size, good suggestion by staff about food."
Momos Delight,Monica Pandey,18 May 2019,1,Ordered because I wanted to eat momos so much and DLF area is popular for street food but I am Disappointed! The momos were undercooked and dry. Had ordered two veg steamed momos and I felt sad because it neither fulfilled my cravings nor it filled my tummy. The closings were hard and uneatable.
Momos Delight,Gautam Narang,18 May 2019,3,"So it‚Äôs 11:30 on a Friday night, most of the restaurants are closed and we are hungry. We find this restaurant still delivering with ratings more than four. We order Veg Steamed Momos and Chicken Steamed Momos. We get the delivery on time and the food is not bad. Schezwan Sauce is steamy hot and delicious; but both the Momos on the drier side. Hence going with 3/5 for this restaurant."
Momos Delight,Ritwik Borgohain,10 May 2019,1,"I ordered the steamed chicken and fried chicken momos.
The momos are pretty terrible, especially considering how much they are asking for it. I've had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendors.They also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me.

I would definitely steer clear of this place, especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else.  Also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and I can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it sounds.If you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron, then sure, go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint. Otherwise learn from my mistake and let it be the only one to have occurred."
Momos Delight,Anjanaa Karthik,09 May 2019,4,"All the Hyderabadis out here, anybody who here who loves street food, obviously, DLF is out there for you ! But don't forget to look out for this shop. You would find steamed and fried momos, but it's very rare to find kurkure momos. Have you even heard about those? Wanna grap a taste ? Go to DLF right away ! :)
It's mouth smacking."
Momos Delight,Biswarup Bose,28 April 2019,4,One of the best places to have momos in and around gachibowli. Located right opposite to DLF this place is over till late night. My favourite is the kurkure momo here. Tastes very different from all the other momos. Must try.
Momos Delight,Pallavi Mitra,16 April 2019,3,"Paneer fried momo was yummy. Thank you, the Mayo and sauce was good. Momos could be more softer, fried was too crispy. Taste could also improve much more."
Momos Delight,Jay Mehta,12 April 2019,2,"Watching ipl and ordred norfest, thought of adding some appetizer to my meal...ordered kurkure momos vegetarian.

Arrived nice and hot and on time

Problem- the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil, the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside.

Sauce was mayo and red sauce. I am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? Antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!

Lessons- never order fried momos again EVER! May try the steamed based on rating."
Momos Delight,Shlok Gupta,31 March 2019,5,"I am addicted to their chicken Kurkure momos.

It's so yummy. Thanks for bringing momos culture to Hyderabad. Hoping to see this culture springs a lot in future."
Momos Delight,Sri D,31 March 2019,5,"I never had a good momos until before I ordered from here. Always thght momos were over-rated. But Momos Delight proved me wrong. I ordered veg- kurkure momos through Zomato and they were lip-smacking good. The red-chilli chutney and mayonnaise were good combination with the momos. Also, they were delivered to me when they are still hot. Zomato‚Äôs service has never been disappointing."
Momos Delight,Avinash Agarwal,30 March 2019,5,It may appear slightly expensive for momos. But they truly taste as amazing if not better than the best momos you had in a north eastern Indian city. Especially the steamed chicken momos with the masala spread and the super spicy chutney perfectly compliments it
Momos Delight,RENUKA DEVI Katikala,29 March 2019,4,"Want to enjoy best steamed momos, this is a must visit place. Chicken or veg they got tasty momos here.
They provide momos with mayo and red sauce."
Momos Delight,Shrutipriya Nandi,16 March 2019,4,Ordered momos from here many times.This place is good for momo lovers like me.I have tried their kukure chicken momo and steamed chicken momo and both are nice.The price of kukure momo is a bit high but it's crispy and tasty so worth a try.
Momos Delight,Krishspark,14 March 2019,5,We have been a regular customer of momos delight. We usually order kurkure momos its super tasty can give 5 stars for tht. Couldnt click a pic of tht we finished it fast. And the next one is fried chicken momos thts also a must try.
Momos Delight,Triveni Arora,04 March 2019,2,I would not recommend this place. I tried their steamed momos and kurkure ones too which were not upto the mark. They dont serve that spicy red chutney that was a bigger shock for me.
Momos Delight,Aloysious Michael,28 February 2019,5,"The Best in n around gachibowli. The best among all. No doubt the shop is small, btw quality is good and worth the money u pay. Try it without hessitating.
Good good good ‚ù§ üíï"
Momos Delight,Mouboni Dutta,28 February 2019,2,I have been here and had it's momos. It was not that great! So i had ordered chicken steamed momos on zomato and was disheartened to find that the momos have degraded further in it's taste. The outer covering was dry and not well cooked. It tasted like it was not freshly made. The filling was not satisfying at all. Moreover the salt was a bit over the top. The sauce served was excessively salty and tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chilli paste. Not good at all. I had been in their shop quite e few times but this time it was really disappointing.
Momos Delight,Rachana Srivastav,27 February 2019,4,I've ordered several times from this place and their Kurkure Momos are simply awesome. They taste just how you get them in Delhi. Even the fried and steamed momos are good but can't beat Kurkure Momos!
Momos Delight,Pratap,22 February 2019,4,"One of the best places to have momos. Had ordered quite a few times from this place through swiggy and zomato. Delivery was on time and packaging was good.
Chicken momos were simply awesome, liked it. Chicken Fried Momos were also good .
Mayonnaise was nice, momo sauce could be better though."
Momos Delight,Saswati Kar Choudhury,21 February 2019,2,"So on one of the weeknite i craved for momos.Most of the delivery points were closed except this.So thot to give it a try.Delivery was delayed and that made me lil upset.I ordered two things: Veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos.

Veg steamed momos:The packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box.The filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood.The veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either.The schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo.
Chichen steamed momo:All of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old.

Highly disappointing! 2stars just for the zomato valet!"
Momos Delight,Raghu,17 February 2019,4,"Known for its momos.
Been to this place couple of times.
Had fried momos in veg and paneer.
Momos, served with mayonnaise and spicy sauce.
Tastes good.

Overall ok."
Momos Delight,Shweta Rapriya,16 February 2019,3,I had ordered veg friend momos and the Momo had no filling in it .. giving 3 starts because of last time's decent experience. Please take care while packing the food.
Momos Delight,Ashwini Singh,08 February 2019,5,Every time I am having a good experience with delight momos. The taste of the momos is so amazing. Kurkure Momos is outstanding n superb . It's one of the best outlet for Momo's lover.
Momos Delight,Sejal Vaghela,04 February 2019,1,Misleading outlet for vegetarians. Owner lied when asked about maintaining separate utensils for veg and nonveg. Never visit if you are a strict vegetarian.
Momos Delight,Abhishek Ganguly,23 January 2019,4,"Momos Delight
The chicken kurkure Momo's were a true delight and so were the chicken Momo's which were sprinkled with some special masala. The only downer was the red Momo chutney as it tasted like Tomato sauce. I am sure if they can make authentic Momos,then they can also make authentic Momo's chutney."
Momos Delight,Tara R Nair,22 January 2019,2,"Ordered steamed veg, paneer and chicken. Chicken was okayish. Paneer was nothing but onion. veg is a total no no! On a side note, who gives out mayo with Momos . Very pocket friendly though."
Momos Delight,Soumyaranjan Nayak,11 January 2019,5,"The best Momos in Hyderabad I have had so far. Right on DLF Road, easy to find. Their Chicken Kurkure Momos are just wow. Excellent food at a reasonable price."
Momos Delight,Nisha Jonwal,31 December 2018,5,One of the best momos place in hyderabad. I ordered chicken steam momos. They were like Delhi style momos. Red momos jauce is spicy and many. Momos have good amounrlt of filling with thin outer covering. Packaging is also nice and clean.
Momos Delight,Subhashree Dey,29 December 2018,2,Chicken momos is fine. I have tried veg before. That's also good. But the problem is mayonnaise. These people use readymade mayonnaise which tastes really horrible/spoiled. Instead they should start making their own.
Momos Delight,Deep Mitra,27 November 2018,1,"Food quality is very poor.today I ordered veg momo.this quality of food is very worst.i can't able eat.dont buy from
here. Such a shameful service."
Momos Delight,Pathakastha666,23 November 2018,2,"I ordered a home delivery of steamed chicken momos, since it was the bestseller. The momos tasted old and chicken tasted lemony. The sauce was traditional red sauce that had no flavour because of excess water added and other sauce was store bought mayo. I had to throw the momos away"
Momos Delight,Satyajit Mahapatra,21 November 2018,1,5 Tiny Veg Momos is what you get for Rs.75. Hyderabad is paradise for food lover but this place is a blot on hyderabad. Added a pic. This is what you get in Momos. Please avoid
Momos Delight,Divya Saraf,29 October 2018,5,"I loved the concept of kurkure Momo's, and was lucky enough to savour the last plate of the night...super delicious and all time favorite üòãüòã"
Momos Delight,Pranay Ch,25 October 2018,1,"Ordered momos from swiggy and this is what I get, stinky and broken momos.

I have never seen such worst and bad momos ever in my life.

Momos Delight,Neelesh Sai,24 October 2018,4,Momos here are really tasty and especially the steamed momos are steamed properly with a thin outer layer.fried momos and kurkure momos are also good
Momos Delight,Anam Raihan,13 October 2018,1,I didn't got the order and I kept calling the delivery guy and he was not receiving my call. I don't know what is wrong with the delivery boy literally pathetic service
Momos Delight,Aishwarya Madan,09 October 2018,4,"I orderedered fried veg momos from this place which were pretty good, not very spicy, filled with veggies,not too oily ,but the quantity was disappointing for the price it came for."
Momos Delight,Abhishek Kumar,08 October 2018,1,"if there was minus rating, I would have given that.
Momos were cold."
Momos Delight,Abhinay Ankala,22 September 2018,5,Its one of my favourite places to have momos. Im addicted to this place... perfect steamed momos at affordable pricing. they have the fried momos n kurkure momos which are a must try too... happy dining yall !
Momos Delight,Mukkutanmai1444,18 September 2018,5,v good
Momos Delight,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,10 September 2018,4.5,"A small kiosk among the many eateries opposite the DLF building. A friend recommended this place as authentic Delhi style Momos, so stopped by.

At around 9pm, only steamed chicken Momos (60/5) were available. They were absolutely steamy hot, soft and delicious. Inside the thin Momo skin, was a large filling of minced chicken meat, minimal veggies. Just perfect.

Momos were served with a nice spicy and tangy red chilly chutney, and a dollop of mayonnaise, that I left. Somehow the combination of Momos and Mayo didn't work for me.

They have crusted 'Kurkure' momos that weren't available, but hope to try them sometime later!

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 5/5 (Chicken filling! ‚≠ê)
Ambience - NA
Service/ Speed - 5/5 (instant ‚≠ê, but availability üëéüèªüôÅ)
VFM - 5/5 (60 for 5 is very good for taste and quality!‚≠ê)"

Momos Delight,Bikalpa Pandey,28 July 2018,1,the momo was smelling and tasting really bad.. like rotten meat.. I ordered from here regularly but this was the worst experience.. I had to throw all the momos away.. Zomato needs to have some quality check for the restaurant they include.. also please don't share my number with the owner.. I don't want to be contacted

Momos Delight,Theemployednomads,25 July 2018,4,"It is one of our favorite place to have famous Tibetan snack ""MOMOS"". I have tried almost all the momos that they serve ranging from Veg and non-veg steam & fried and paneer kurkure momos....
It tastes similar to the ones available in north India (I mean Delhi). However, I think the portion size is quiet less as 1 plate has only 6 momos.....
Ambience: 1/5 (just a small booth outside DLF, Gachibowli)
Location: 4/5
Taste: 5/5
Service: 5/5
value for money; 4/5 (Portion size is small)"

I have mostly ordered online multiple times with satisfaction every time."

Momos Delight,Annu Priya,09 July 2018,4,Big fan of kurkure chicken momos served here. I used to like chicken fried momos first but now kurkure momos come to my mind as soon as I think of momos.

Momos Delight,Vicky,06 July 2018,1,quantity is very low
Momos Delight,Meghana Singamsetti,06 July 2018,3,I asked them to send extra sauces they didnt do it after assuring also food was good
Momos Delight,Madhurjya,05 July 2018,4,Size of the momos could be improved...Otherwise taste is fine enough
The Chocolate Room,Prachita Jayaswal,23 May 2019,5,The chocolate excess cake was awesome. It was a completely filled with chocolate ganache. It is fairly priced. It isn't bitter in taste. The cake was moist and juicy. The ambience of this place is good. Nice place to hangout with friends.
The Chocolate Room,_ Gluttonous Hedonist,21 May 2019,4,"The chocolate brownie and waffles will take you by an awwww! For someone who craves for chocolate, it's a perfect place. The ambience is just decent."
The Chocolate Room,Foodoholic,21 May 2019,2,"In general my experience with the chocolate room was not up to the mark.
I had oreo cookie shake and KitKat shake at two separate visits. Both tasted bland and I couldnt quite get the crispyness of oreo and flavour of the KitKat.
I hope they improve .."
The Chocolate Room,Rajat,19 May 2019,1,"Went there for morning breakfast but what a disappointment, everything out of stock no nachos,no stock for their signature chocolate pizzas. I seriously wonder was it a way denying customer for using zomato gold privileges or what. Cz first i placed the order the waiter said it will take 15 mins but when i showed him gold unlock he simply said its out of stock. What a shame!!"
The Chocolate Room,Chirag Gupta ?,10 May 2019,2,"Bad service at this place overshadows the good food.
They are clearly understaffed, and the existing staff seem to not care at all about the customers.
The place felt like a heat box when we went there as they didn't care to switch the ACs on."
The Chocolate Room,Himanshoosharma,04 May 2019,1,"The worst experience. We told them that we'll be unlocking zomato gold and they said yes. Come the bill without gold benefits... Then they started arguing with us that we didn't tell them about zomato gold.
P.S.: Don't order pasta here , or maybe do if you like sloppy goo."
The Chocolate Room,Raghu Dahagam,03 May 2019,5,"Chocolate room!!
A must visit place for all the chocolate lovers!!
This chain has been around for more than a decade now and they still keep me amused each time I visit.

I tried dark chocolate fondue. The dark chocolate was flavourful, thick and glossy. The dips were very well coherent with the chocolate and they are all 100% eggless!

Potato wedges poutine was another dish that I loved the most and you should not miss this! It has white sauce pasta base with well seasoned potato wedges!

The pancakes were fulffy and are perfect when paired with hot chocolate!

Service - was bit slow as we went around 10 pm but the staff is really attentive !

Price- Reasonable price for the quality and the quantity they serve!"
The Chocolate Room,Aishwarya Verma,13 April 2019,2,It's a nice place but I didn't have a great experience with their home delivery. I had ordered pasta via Swiggy and they sent the wrong order. I complained and got the order sent again. The sent the wrong item for the second time around as well. Poor experience. But decent when you go there and eat.
The Chocolate Room,Anamay Tamrakar (Aman),06 April 2019,3,"Didn't really enjoy much here. Its a dessert place, so you go with a mindset to increase some kilos. But the desserts were not so good. The ambience quiet dull and boring. Haven't gone there since"
The Chocolate Room,Naveen,31 March 2019,3,"Not worth for money, ordered french fries and chocolate milkshake...waited for so much time after ordering, waiter forgot about the order and came again for taking the order."
The Chocolate Room,Tyrion Lannister,23 March 2019,5,"Nice ambience..fast serving..near to my place.. enjoyed it. Ordered shake and brownie. It was amazing, hest place to visit witg friends it was quite rush on fridays and weekends"
The Chocolate Room,Deepak Rajana,11 March 2019,3,"Place have good ambience.
Gold benefits are eligible even on shakes.
We ordered shakes on sunny day.
Service is slow, we have to go to service counter and asked twice for taking order.
Smooties are okish, they are not thick shakes.
Pricing 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Location 5/5
Service 2/5"
The Chocolate Room,M Harshnavi,08 March 2019,1,"It was such an disappointment. Agent Mannan was so rude to me. Also, I ordered 3 kits of from Chocolate room; although I received only one. I would say it was a worst experience. I felt so ignored."
The Chocolate Room,The Foodie Bookworm,06 March 2019,3,"The food is quite decent here, but extremely over priced, from the coffees to the cakes everything is over priced and few days back I bought of hand made chocolates for my roommate and they were not upto the mark according to the price."
The Chocolate Room,Anusha Sinha,24 February 2019,4,"It's actually quite nice. Ordered pasta, cold coffee, waffles.
The taste was yummy.
It's a cute care like ambience with small television screens that showcases matches. and music video.
The service is good."
The Chocolate Room,Ketan Azad,23 February 2019,2,"We ordered four different ice creams
1 chocolate ecstasy
2 chocolate chocolate sundae
3 chocolate banana split
4 the chocolate room brownie Sundae
and all of them were same"
The Chocolate Room,Pratheek Denny Padinjarathala,16 February 2019,4,"One of the best places for a hangout especially if you are a couple or a group. With the rich ambience of a chocolate filled aroma and delightful lighting, it would definitely be one of the best place to go. They have a variety of hot chocolates and coffees with subtle differences, only a true lover would be able to appreciate."
The Chocolate Room,Sheri M John,10 February 2019,3,"This is a good place to hangout, as they wont kick you out no matter how long you stay. The playlists played are really good. Food is just up to the mark if you just want to hangout and are not a food critique. The ambience and service are good, except for the occasional cockroaches that run around."
The Chocolate Room,Deepali Sharma,06 February 2019,1,"Really disappointed after receiving my cappuccino , I had ordered through zomato app only and they delivered the coffee in a disposable juice glass covered with foil. Worst experience of online ordering! Never order online anything from here"
The Chocolate Room,Manu S Kurup,30 January 2019,2,"I'm disappointed after last night's dinner I had here. I was visiting TCR after a long time and ordered a Dark on warm mug, Salad and a Mint Mojito. While the Dark was awesome, the other two items disappointed me. The Salad had very raw cucumber and it gave me a bad stomach pain from which I'm still suffering. They also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken, cucumber, lettuce, capsicum and tomato. Giving plastic fork to substitute real cutlery is way more disappointing than anything in a place as reputed as TCR. The mint Mojito was a tad bit less disappointing. The syrups flavor dominated all the way till half the glass!"
The Chocolate Room,Bhavna Bhardwaj,24 January 2019,2,"To be honest, it is an average place to hang out. The cold coffee or drinks made by me tastes better than what is served here. Minimal efforts have been done to maintain customer satisfaction. Almost all the items tastes average and not worth the money."
The Chocolate Room,Medha Parashar,19 January 2019,4,"First of all... Very classy ambience... You will just love sitting here and pass your time while nibbling on its starters...
Do have oreo shake..
Panner and corn Sandwich.. I had to eat this because i went with a vegetarian friend.. So sorry for that.. Cant tell you what to have in non veg.. You can connect to free WiFi and work peacefully too if you are a workaholic.."
The Chocolate Room,HImanshu Gupta,25 December 2018,1,The place lost its charm and service. Things like drinking glass with bottle of water that too 1 glass in the whole restaurant . Serving plate with food is something you have to ask for. Tissue paper on table is missing again ask for it. In all my last visit as everything have shelve life .. RIP Chocolate room üôè
The Chocolate Room,Shubhra Hajela,23 December 2018,2,"Did not like the quality of chocolate ice cream served with the pancakes. Tasted as if it was laced with some chemical, gave a metallic taste to the palette after few bites. Was also dissatisfied with the waffle. Very rubbery, was difficult to cut. Lastly, the service was poor and rude. Wont bother going here again."
The Chocolate Room,Himanshi Mishra,08 December 2018,5,"Love their sandwiches, specially tandoori paneer grilled sandwich. The place has a great ambience. The prices are little high but quality is good."
The Chocolate Room,Vasu,27 November 2018,2,The one which I always eat here is chocolate sizzler.But now I feel it‚Äôs not worth to visit chocolate room for chocolate sizzler as the quality is decreased.Sizzler which we got this time is having so much of brownie but they din‚Äôt think of giving enough chocolate sauce and also the brownie is over cooked.
The Chocolate Room,Pranjali,25 November 2018,5,Great place for chocolate lovers. My kids enjoy it every time. The cuddle cup concept is too cute. Chocolate fondue is to die for. The staff is a little untrained. Could do with some more sophistication.
The Chocolate Room,Joydeep Barman,25 November 2018,3,Ordered chocolate brownie from online.... The pic was sooo good but in reality its not that much.... LOL... Anywaz it was good. Nice brownie...
The Chocolate Room,Amritorupa Kanjilal,24 November 2018,3,"The traditional chicken sandwich was amazing, but the Earl Grey tasted like salty water :(.
Will be back to try the pastries. Environment was pleasant but could have been a bit cleaner"
The Chocolate Room,SONIYA SINHA,16 November 2018,3,"Have been to The Chocolate Room at other locations so visit to this one was quite awaiting. Like the ambiance and the aroma of hot chocolate that fills the restaurant. A good place to date. Definitely a little heavy on the pocket. Staff is friendly. 
We ordered:

‚Ä¢ Chicken cheese sandwich

‚Ä¢ Chocolate walnut sundae

‚Ä¢ Hot Hazelnut

The staff needs to focus on hygiene, there were cockroaches around the billing counter which was really disappointing; we pointed the same to the staff. The washroom was bad, no tissues or hand-wash. ‚òπ"
The Chocolate Room,Shrikant Wadhwani,14 November 2018,1,"This outlet is the worst i have ever seen . There were cockroaches on table , food quality was bad and no one to take order on time. Please go to some other outlet don't ever try this outlet"
The Chocolate Room,Anirban Saha,06 November 2018,5,"Absolutely love this place. Best place to visit for a cup of hot chocolate in Gachibowli.
Do try hot chocolate in one of the cuddle cups with someone you wanna cuddle too ;P ... Staff is courteous. Ambience is really nice. Pocket pinch is totally worth it.
I won't get tired of recommending this place. Do try pancakes and waffles and hot chocolate here.."
The Chocolate Room,Princy Singh Rajput,04 November 2018,3,"Great place for all the chocolate lovers you will find All varieties of chocos in this shop.
Ambience is good....service is also good. Food items are also good."
The Chocolate Room,Srinivas K,02 November 2018,2,"Tried Pizza and Spaghetti looking at the reviews. Not sure how this place has 3+ Rating.

Food taste- not that great and specially at the price you would expect some quality or effort in it.

Pizza had an uncooked base and the sauce they used on the base was normal sweet ketchup. A few bellpeppers on top and rest was normal cheese. Not what you will expect after giving 250 bucks for it. Same with Spaghetti- came in a tiny box, no garlic bread, On the name of Aglio olio- it was just couple of olives and olive oil and nothing else. No herbs/ seasoning or flakes."
The Chocolate Room,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,31 October 2018,4,"Ordered the chocolate avalanche. The quantity is too much that easily 3 people can have it in dessert. Hence, the price is not too costly if you keep the quantity in mind. It was a brownie and ice cream kinda mixture which was too chocolaty and perfect for the chocolate craving. The waffer became soggy in it and didn't taste good. They should start serving a smaller size too so that we can order for one person too at a lesser cost!"
The Chocolate Room,Foodkong,28 October 2018,3,"Ordered swiss chocolate cake from here.

Nice when it arrive. packing is good

Could have used nice quality ingredients to make it better as the cream was like some powder mix

Would try again if they improve the cream of cake.

Thank you .hope the restro improves"
The Chocolate Room,Shahil Varshney,26 October 2018,1,"Bounty milk shake: -1/5We ordered a Bounty milk shake and that was the pathetic so called ""SHAKE"" I ever had in my Life so Far. And the price was Rs 189 which was not even worth if given for free. A normal tea from office pantry tastes far better than this drink. I dont have an option for giving a NEGATIVE Rating, hence forced to give a ""1"", when its not even worth to have a rating. We were so hungry and planned to have some food, but we were so tired with the shake given and we packed up without even finishing half glass of the drink. I will never prefer this to anyone even the restaurant offer for a free treat."
The Chocolate Room,Reetesh,08 October 2018,1,Have been a fan of chocolate room since years and this ones really disappointed me . A worst experience an awfull taste and they call walnuts as almond
The Chocolate Room,Vaishakhi R Kamath,01 October 2018,5,"The chocolate options at The Chocolate Room, Gachibowli are amazing.
I personally love their Chocolate Avalanche ‚ù§Ô∏è
The ambience of the place was good with friendly staff around üëç"
The Chocolate Room,Vansheeka Maheshwari,22 September 2018,1,THE WORST EVER PANCAKES! I‚Äôm not even kidding. It‚Äôs a total waste of money! And they delivered something way different than what was mentioned in the menu! Hope they improve üôÑ
The Chocolate Room,Shivangi Jaiswal,22 September 2018,4,"This is one old good place to have deserts since years.
I have visited many outlets of chocolate room, at Himayat nagar, Banjara hills, and this.
The best i feel is Gachibowli chocolate room.
They have little app offers too
- one+one on pasta
-sandwich+thickshake
Etc
Do checkout!!
Alfredo pasta isna must tryyy :)
The paneer tikka sandwich could have been better..."
The Chocolate Room,Vedant Killa,14 September 2018,3,"Sinful. Nothing describes this place better. üò¨

Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired, but the service is so appalling, probably you‚Äôll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive. The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment. I‚Äôd recommend you do that cause anyway, they deliver orders after forever. üôà

As the name goes, I‚Äôve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar. And hence, I‚Äôve never tried the savoury items offered here. But I‚Äôve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos. So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. üôÇ

The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz. So full of the taste- actually well prepared. The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you‚Äôve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad. üòù

Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes: so good ! A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream. Make sure to hit the gym soon after :P

Slightly higher on the price point, but worth a try! üòÄ"
The Chocolate Room,The Fit Foodie üòãüòéü§ë,03 September 2018,5,Superb place. Went to fulfill some early morning cravings. Easy to locate it as it's situated in the busy street of vinayak nagar Gachibowli. Ambiance is nice and calm they have separate kids play area and a party hall for celebrations. The place can easily accommodate 50 to 70 people. Coming to food we ordered 1. Garden fresh sandwich it was really loaded with some nice veggies and perfect amount of cheese and toasted to perfection 2. The veg cheese sandwich again it was yummy and had roasted mushrooms to go with onion and cheese. 3. Oreo cookie shake - Sweetness was just adequate and flavour was awesome as well though they can do something with the thickness of it as it was way watery for my liking. Recommended ü§ò
The Chocolate Room,Ayan Mishra,01 September 2018,2,Very poor packing.
The Chocolate Room,AJ,27 August 2018,3,Pancakes not cooked properly
The Chocolate Room,Aswathi P,23 August 2018,4,"We ordered cakes, shakes and hot chocolate. The cakes were simply amazing! Shakes and hot chocolate was alright.
The ambience is good. We sat there for hours at ease and didn't realise time had gone by!
Good place."
The Chocolate Room,Sidharth Mittal,20 August 2018,2,"Hazelnut coffee 2/5
Poor quality, the coffee already had sugar and it was watery.
This was my 2nd time here and the place still disappointed me.
Might not come again.."
The Chocolate Room,Shruti Khandelwal,16 August 2018,1,"I ordered hazulnut delight, however there was no hazelnut flavour. The beverage was all spilled in the plastic bag it was delivered in
Not a good experience ‚òπÔ∏è"
The Chocolate Room,Prasant Sekar,15 August 2018,4,It‚Äôs just like the other Chocolate Room outlet I‚Äôve visited and the only difference I noticed here is the missing cycle! Service is good but it‚Äôs unhygienic even though it doesn‚Äôt look like one. Chocizza and sandwich are worth trying here! It‚Äôs accessible to Gachibowli residents and it‚Äôs located midst other leading outlets!
The Chocolate Room,Arjun Oberoi,12 August 2018,1,Food was cold.
The Chocolate Room,Arnab Ghatak,12 August 2018,1,Have been delivered a very bad version of this cult favourite dish of chocolate room. Didn't give ice cream instead it was clearly whipped cream.
The Chocolate Room,Gayatri Tandon,11 August 2018,4,"Nice and subtle environment to hang out with friends with really nice food. However the staff can be more cordial.
Food is really nice. Do try out their Chico brownie sizzler with Vanilla Ice cream. Also try out their mushroom and cheese penne pasta, if you're a white sauce pasta fan.

P.s. you may follow me on my Instagram page by the name of simbas_sister for more interesting food feeds. ;)"
The Chocolate Room,Bezawada Himabindu,31 July 2018,3,taste and qulity good. packing bad.

The Chocolate Room,Amulyareddy.gobbur,28 July 2018,1,Ordered toblerone and kit kat milk shake from this place...both looks same and tastes also same...its like boost and bornvita milk without any cream or any icecream...both are mixed with more water and less milk and chocolate syrups...spoiled our taste buds by ordering from this place...waste of money never order again
The Chocolate Room,Upasana,27 July 2018,5,"amazing food with the sandwich being thr very best. Being a lover of non veg, this veg combo was sooo good!"
The Chocolate Room,Anusmita Das,25 July 2018,5,"I'm totally maaaad about chocolates. So when I came across something named ""Chocolate Room"" , you could imagine my happiness! As expected, I was so confused about what to order because everything on the menu looked DELISH. I ended up ordering a Choco Crunch Mocha. The ambience was so cool for hangouts and the service was good too. The prices were reasonable. I'd love to go back there pretty soon!"
The Chocolate Room,Siv Souvam,25 July 2018,5,"A nice place to hangout with friends.
A lot more to explore about chocolate dishes here.
A place with good ambience.
A place with late night food & chocolate dishes upto 12 in night."
The Chocolate Room,Sravani Bodanapu,17 July 2018,2,"The chocolate room, I think the name itself is a like a bliss for chocoholics. Well, it was around 6 in the evening & I wasn't even hungry so I had to order something light.

I ordered for a KitKat milkshake.
It took a little bit of waiting for the order to come. The main thing was that it wasn't chill when served. I felt the milkshake would had tasted much better if was more thick. It kindof lacked that real chocolaty flavour.

The place was fine to sit & talk. Well, nothing much to mention about the ambience."

The Chocolate Room,Shivam Pathak,25 May 2018,3,"Ordered Paneer Tikka and Garden Fresh Sandwich with Oreo shake. 
Paneer Tikka - 5/5
Garden Fresh - 5/5
Oreo Shake - 4/5 ( As it was not so cold )
Staff : 1/5 If you request them some changes they would behave like kids and are not flexible at all, removing a topping would not cost them anything but they deny to do so. Something which is terrible out there.

Overall the ambiance was not so good. Ac was not working properly and it was a bit dull out there.

Food - 3.5*
Ambience: 4.5*

Closes at 12 am, hence good place for late night cravings."

The Chocolate Room,RAJ KISHORE,06 April 2018,3,The Gachhibowli Chocolate Room is a nice place.I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food on all of my three visits so far.However the quantity as shown in the menu is never the same on ur plate.Expect always a half filled stomach once u return back after spending comparatively a higher amount than any other meeting points like CCD.

American Wild Wings,Karthik Sreeram,25 May 2019,5,"found them on Zomato website, a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially Texas BBQ, Spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like Original hot and Amazon wild comes in to top of mind. Did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing. Dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy. Over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo. Biryanis served here us very special like Wings Biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well. over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place."
American Wild Wings,Pushpendra Singh,25 May 2019,1,"Out of hunger and trust on the restaurant I ordered a chicken burger from American wild wings, Gachibowli hoping it would be tasty and healthy but the kind of service i recieved was really pathetic. At first the restaurant took almost 40 mins to prepare just a small chicken burger, i tried calling restaurant about the update and they weren't even responsive, didn't answer any of my call. I kept my patience and waited for the order to arrive. aftr receiving the order what i saw was really a bad experience. The french fries that I used to get always were replaced by some oily, smelly, rotten potato pakodis. Not just that I hoped my burger to be nice but it was again a big disappointment. The very first bite of it tasted really bad. Chicken seemed fried to be in very bad oil and smelled filthy. I had to throw it after my first three bites. And then after sometime i even started Having pain in my stomach . This particular experience of mine was very disappointing with american wild wings. I didn't think of myself to waste money, wait for an hour and still get suffer after Eating that food"
American Wild Wings,Harjeev Singh,22 May 2019,3,I've ordered from this place a couple of times and I loved the burger and fries. But last night the burger I got was undercooked and reeked of vegetable oil. It was completely inedible. Writing this review to bring it to the management's notice so they can fix this and make sure it doesn't happen again.
American Wild Wings,Kirthi Kirthi,22 May 2019,3,Worst chicken popcorn had ever in my life.strawberry mojito is good.but taste of chicken is not at all good.i didn't recommend it to order popcorn.
American Wild Wings,Ritwika Dash,22 May 2019,5,"So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. üòç The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

Taste wise : 4.5/5
Price: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)"
American Wild Wings,Ammar KanchWala,22 May 2019,4,"*Visit By Invite*

Located in a buzy spot, this joint has definitely some good food to offer.

We tried a host of items from the menu. Starting off with Chicken Nuggets which were the show stopper. Next up we had Chicken wings, which to be honest didn't excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings.

Fried Chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries. Chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used didn't look fresh. Chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal. To keep the show running, we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings, spices rather than having it served just with mayo.

In the end, we had Biryani which gets served under the brand of Fireblast Biryani. This biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of Biryani's in town need some more experiments with flavors.

While food here is decent, the ambiance requires immideat attention. The entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items. A bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience. #TheWandererFoodies

American Wild Wings,Raj Kumar,18 May 2019,5,"Hello Hyderabad..!!!!!My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around Hitech City and Gachibowli. it is  located near the DLF signals and beside Creamstone Gachibowli above Thick Shakes. 
The ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.

The menu design with array spans of Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Red hot roasted Chicken Wings  ‚ù§Ô∏è - Juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with Mexican                                                                   Jerk Suces Yummy unforgettable. 

Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.

Drum Stick Dum Biryani-
OMG very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. 
Drum Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Nachos topped with red sauce and I JUST  loved it.  
Combos ‚ù§Ô∏è - The true fact i have ever seen even in KFC, Mc-Donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. 

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mock-tails. Sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! Also a fan of coke float.

The staff is ever so courteous. Awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!!!!!"
American Wild Wings,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),17 May 2019,4,"It's hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am. American Wild wings is one of them. It's just beside Creamstone, Gachibowli. They deliver chicken wings,salad,popcorn,fries,biriyani and Andhra style chicken from evening till morning . They have a decent seating arrangement too. For chicken wings, you got almost 10/12 sauces to choose upon. Among them my favorite are Texas BBQ and Mexican jerk. Also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing. Their biriyani comes with drumsticks / wings. Tried the drumstick biriyani. Chicken were well spicy and well with Curry leaves ( Andhra style). Service,ambience and prices all were decent. Nothing fancy to be expected.
So if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in Creamstone visit here.

American Wild Wings,Zubair Mohammed Iftekhar,15 May 2019,5,"American Wild Wings is an affordable version of B-dubs. Mainly focused on Wings, Fries and Burgers with a touch of Desi dishes as well.

I was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love Chicken Wings. The various Sauces on offer is amazing. We tried Pattaya Thai, Texas BBQ, Mexican Jerk, Original Hot and Amazon Wild. I liked BBQ and Original Hot, both were exceptional. We then moved on to Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Fried Burger and Grilled Chicken Salad. Nuggets were amazing, crispy and soft while Burger and Salad were delicious as well.

We had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails, namely Lemonade and Mango. Both were pretty good but can be improved.

Service was great. We were very well taken care by Mr Srinivas, the branch manager. Ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fast-food joint.

Overall, an excellent place for Chicken Wing lovers and that too at a moderate price range."
American Wild Wings,Vamshi Puli,15 May 2019,4,"I absolutely love chicken wings so I had to try this new place in Gachibowli as I‚Äôve heard about it from a few friends.

I‚Äôve been to this place with a group of foodie friends.
This is a small outlet located on the first floor ,right above dirty burgers.
The place can host upto 30 pax max.
The place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place.



Food:
We tried different sauces:
The Texas bbq ,spicy garlic ,Pattaya Thai ,original hot ,Mexican jerk and Amazon wild.
All of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness.
The wings were slightly crispy outside and soft inside,just the way I like them to be.

Next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn.
The best munching dish I love till date are the chicken nuggets.
They tasted really good and were tastier than expected.
The nuggets were my favourite.

The chicken popcorn was not that great.
The presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy.
Need to improve this.

Surprisingly the menu had biryani in it.
We tried their wings dim biryani .
The biryani was not that proper Hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste .
They served a really good quantity of biryani.

The management has to improve in their food presentations.
I personally liked this place and recommend everyone to do give it a try."
American Wild Wings,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,14 May 2019,4,"American Wild Wings = Amazing Wings
I happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner. Well who doesn't like chicken wings? I love wings so wanted to check out this place.
It's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. Interiors are decent and so is the seating. There aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. They have self service system.
Coming to food and menu,
The menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. So it is value for money. The only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.
Taste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.
I tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, Pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, Mexican jerk and Amazon wild. To my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.
Tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... Among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.
The menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. The quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. Also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. It was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.
Also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. Had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the KFC burger.
Overall the place is affordable and nice. The hospitality was very nice. Thanks Mr. Srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. The staff is humble and friendly.
Recommended!!"
American Wild Wings,Uma,14 May 2019,5,"A great hangout place for the IT employees and with with really reasonable prices.

Peaceful ambience with no much of chaos in the place.

Order was taken as per our wishlist and made the items accordingly with the required spicyness and etc.

We had chicken fry , chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn and then boneless chicken biryani which were served really very hot and tasty.

Overall a very comfortable place with affordable prices and quality food.

Would surely drop by sometime whenever possible :)"
American Wild Wings,Salwa Rahman,14 May 2019,5,"American Wild Wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. Located in Gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish Chicken Wings.

I tried out their Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Salad, Chicken Fried Burger and Various Chicken Wings. The sauce I loved the most was BBQ Chicken Wings. Chicken Nuggets were amazing as well.

We tried their Lemonade and Mango Mojito, they were okay but can be improved. The service by Mr Srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. Ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.

This place is a must try for their Wings and Nuggets."
American Wild Wings,Bharti Mehta,14 May 2019,4,"Rating - 3.5

Visited this place on a Friday evening. The interiors are okayish, they need to work alot upon that.

Now coming to food:

We tried their wings in 8-9 different sauces. Most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone.

My personal favorite was Mexican jerk, Barbeque and Konaseema. Though the sauces can be reduced a little.

Also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved. The lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder.

We also ordered Virgin Mojito which was very very sweet for our palate.

The Chicken Caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces. The chicken was very chewy.

We also ordered Chicken Biryani and Patiala Chicken.

The biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it. Meat was fresh and tender.

Patiala Chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it.

Also the Chicken Popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement.

The white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking.

Overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced."
American Wild Wings,Shreshth Malhotra,14 May 2019,4,"American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli. The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. Went there with my friends to try out their food. I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover.

Starting with their appetizers, We first tried out their in house Chicken wings. So, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ, Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Amazon wild etc.

My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings. The wings were super juicy and delicious. However, I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.

Next up, we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken. The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. The Popcorn chicken was chewy. It requires serious attention and changes.

For mains, the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan, Raita and Gongura Chicken. The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish. To my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani.

Thanks for a wonderful time Mr. Srinivas. Moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday. Happy eating, :)"
American Wild Wings,Suparna Banerjee,13 May 2019,4,"They say ""count your chicken before they hatch"" and this weekend I did almost that. Hehehe, well, we were counting them before having it üòÜüçóüòâ.

Our visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by Mr. Srinivas Lanka incharge of the restaurant operations, management and marketing. This place on a main location of Gachibowli, Hyderabad with a dine-in. They offer American Cuisine for üêîüêìüçó chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in Chicken Wings.

We got some thirst-quenching mojito mocktails- lemonade, orange and strawberry. They also offer slushies but was not available at that time. Moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces- Pattaya Thai, Spicy Garlic, Texas BBQ and Mexican Jerk (üëà this one was my favourite). They were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside.

Pattaya Thai- spicy sauce with coarse texture
Spicy Garlic- Finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce
Texas BBQ- the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli. 
Mexican Jerk- a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my üíì.  

We also ordered for Popcorn Chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive, Original Patty burger which was quite simple (no veggies in it, not even the basic ones like- tomato, onion rings or lettuce) and was served pretty hot with French fries so be careful when you take a bite. We also ordered for Asian (fried) Chicken Salad but was served with Caesar Chicken salad ü•ó, which was little disappointing to taste as well.

You can definitely visit this place on Fridays and Saturdays for drinks (liquor) as well. So here is my rating on this-  

Food- 4/5 (this is just for the chicken wings alone)
Service- 3.5/5 (little slow but courteous staff)
Ambience- 3/5 (nice and decent)

Overall I would like to rate it 3.8/5 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future.

American Wild Wings,Anvith Devulapally,12 May 2019,4,"We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

American Wild Wings,K Subhakar,11 May 2019,5,"Been there for a dinner had a great experience of tasting Chicken wings ordered hulk wings so delicious hot served with mind blowing sauces like original hot , amazon wild , lemon pepper and pataya thai at a reasonable price. their combos were really superb with unmatched quality of burgers and salads with refreshing lemonade and starwberry mojitos. However suggest to  place different flavors of dips to be served with wings to make it more and more tasty."
American Wild Wings,George B.,08 May 2019,4,"I was invited by Mr. Srinivas, the man in charge at AWW for a tasting lunch session, the food was complimentary from their side. I had a nice afternoon there. The restaurant is very well placed in Gachibowli, just near Karachi Bakery on Old Mumbai Highway.

The best part of the experience (beside the wonderful time spent with Mr. Srinivas) was the food. I tasted their chicken nuggets, caesar salad, different types of chicken wings and I took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries.
- I really encourage everyone to try their wings! I had texas bbq sauce, parmesan and garlic, mexican and lemon pepper sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed every style. The wings were juicy and tender, yammm.
- Caesar salad was very nicely dressed, nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete.
- The burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city. The burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun.
- Nuggets were regular, deep fried with mayo, nothing special here, just a decent starter.
More of that, I checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable!

Aside the good food, there is some room for improvement. The place should be better maintained. At the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point. The order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there. The tables, floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential! And also I would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible, it bended every each time I tried to pick some food. If they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good.

Overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area. But definitely recommended for a least a try!

American Wild Wings,Moumita Das,08 April 2019,1,I ordered French Friesüçü. Instead I received Aloo Bhartaa!! Literally poor packaging quality. All went to the üóë. üòì please improve your quality. I wish I knew I would get such soggy not even 1% fried fries.
American Wild Wings,Padmasree Dasari,24 March 2019,5,"Compared to buds, we really found the best taste of wings and fires. So good that we are getting food delivered deliciously. We have found good packing and even burgers is taste is awsome."
American Wild Wings,Pavan Kaligotla,22 March 2019,5,American wild wings is a restaurant which serves us the better food with a good quality. Actually ii had ordered the wings they are awesome in taste but should be some what less juicy
American Wild Wings,Haleemah Siddeeqah,22 March 2019,5,very nice place to visit with a good ambiance and the food is very tasty and the staff is also very much friendly. and one more suggestion is to change the menu regularly
American Wild Wings,Aditya,18 March 2019,1,"It is very rare that the food is so horrible that you have to leave it mid-way and post a review. 

I ordered Chicken Burger + Fries + Wings + Soft drink combo through Zomato, and received my order fairly quickly. However,
(1) Fries were totally cold and soggy. 
(2) Burger was average - tasted like the low-end 40 rupees burger at McDonalds.
(3) Wings were either burnt or double-fried. There were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black - and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top.

Looking at other reviews it feels like it might be once-in-a-while exception but they ruined my Monday Lunch!

Wouldn't recommend."
American Wild Wings,Debomita Sandhya,14 March 2019,3,"would rate this place 3.5
The food is good no doubt but they are not professional with the quantity. I have ordered Ceasar salad twice. Once, the quantity was decent, but the next time it was very less. Please take note before ordering. Food is good though."
American Wild Wings,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),06 March 2019,3,"Burger Combos-
Ambiance-
American Wild Wings is recently opened restaurant at IndiraNagar Gachibowli. They have a large indoor sitting area available and have beautiful lights. Counter is located at one of the sides of restaurant.
Food-
American Wild Wings serves burgers, chicken wings, drumsticks, chinese and combos. They also serve food with variety of sauces like Tandoori sauce, chill garlic sauce, etc. We placed an order for grilled chicken burger, fries, chicken wings and coke combo. Burger was very tasty and loaded with cheese and grilled chicken. We also placed an for chicken drumsticks which came into three large chicken leg pieces with chilly garlic sauce which was mouth watering.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very good."
American Wild Wings,Shantam Sinha,24 February 2019,1,Terrible wings. Not sure if this was just a one off or not but it was inedibly spicy. Good fries tho. Choice for sauces would probably be mich more helpful.
American Wild Wings,HImanshu Gupta,23 February 2019,5,Wings are of very good quality and variety and quality of sauces is very good.. just keep it up play some light music in the restaurant. American theme;)
American Wild Wings,Swayamjit Mohapatro,14 February 2019,1,I ordered bean wings but all I received was disappointment and bad taste undercooked wings. The popcorns were like nuggets but decent. Each wing tasted different and bad.
American Wild Wings,Roshan Raj Kotla,08 February 2019,2,"Ordered ceaser salad. It contained lettuce, lettuce and more lettuce. Not to mention couple of tomato slices and some HARD chicken meat. Ignore the sauces. It was jus for smell sake ! Avoid Salads from them !!!"

American Wild Wings,Rumman Siddiqua Choudhury,23 January 2019,1,The wings were very bad in taste and please rather than packing the cold drinks its better to give Cans. The cold drink was not packed well and all the drink fell down. Fries were not well packed. Hope you guys look into the matters soon
American Wild Wings,Rakhee Teja,14 January 2019,5,"It's really yummy .the best ever burger with slight konaseema chicken taste.

Chicken wings biriyani is delicious"
American Wild Wings,Bijasmita Debnath,15 November 2018,2,"Ordered Chicken and Rice Combo. The packing was horrible. A portion of the Coke dripped into the packet leading to make the whole thing sticky. Even the tissue papers were smeared with Coke. The rice tasted sour. The drumstick smelt foul. The only thing met expectations was the Fries. May be for the first time in my life, I had to throw away half of my food. Would to look forward for the betterment of the quality and taste."
American Wild Wings,Laksmi Naga Kishore,14 November 2018,4,"Food was good
Place was nice

Choice of sauces met customer satisfaction with a couple of fries"
American Wild Wings,Sirisha,13 November 2018,5,"As it's name suggests the wings are mouth watering. you can really enjoy the taste of tender,juicy and freshly prepared chicken. Lots of varieties in sauces and different kinds of wings are always pushing me to order from this restaurant.Quantity of combos are huge. I have heard ambience is too good. I am looking forward to come for dine too."
American Wild Wings,Samit Koirala,11 November 2018,2,"Packaging was really bad, sauce was dripping from the packet. Also ordered Sprite can and they delivered in a glass. Shouldn't like customer this way. Needs lot of improvement if they want to be in business for long"
American Wild Wings,Adithya Varun,08 November 2018,1,"Hello
I just ordered from your place on Zomato I just don't want to comment on food that is up to your standards but the softdrink which you have sent is smelling like bathroom cleaner please let me know are you serving soft drinks or any harpic(bathroom cleaner) kind of thing."
American Wild Wings,Vayu Nandan,02 November 2018,5,"It's a great place to have food. Best quality with quantity. The ambience is great. The services are very fast. Each item has as great flavour and taste with each being different.

American Wild Wings,Romil Aggarwal,27 October 2018,3,"I'd rate it 2.5 I ordered 'the original patty burger' and wings. The burger was quite average or maybe even on the lower side. The buns felt dry. The patty wasn't anything special. The fries that came with it were too salty. The wings, however, were tasty[4/5]."
American Wild Wings,Nagarjunareddy G,26 October 2018,5,Nice food. Good restaurant and compensate the value for money. Best north and south Indian foods and effortabl prices. Rich look and maintenance.
American Wild Wings,Ashfahossain,24 October 2018,1,They served me burnt food and topped with sauce ! It was all smelling burned and the decorated it and served .. crazy ppl and on complaining zomato says they need to investigate .. woah I would never order from this place and still there‚Äôs no action taken on it !
American Wild Wings,Babban Irani,22 October 2018,2,"Staff was polite and friendly, but the food and the taste was below parüòíüòí. The burgers were decent but their wings are baaaad.... At the time we went even the power was also not there."
American Wild Wings,Bhanu Prakash,21 October 2018,4,"American wild wings as the name tells wings are too wild. The blend of sauces to the chicken wings produce a complete new taste.

Ambience was good enough for families.

Service was good and polite."
American Wild Wings,Lakshman Kumar Goli,17 October 2018,5,"I love how they treat the customers, I think I'll never taste the wings before, The taste is really awesome.. I suggest to open one store in Ameerpet too.... I recommend to have a fine Dine IN with your friends and family.."
American Wild Wings,Lakshmi P,17 October 2018,4,"A small cute place to visit. Simple decor. Love the lighting here. The staff are really polite and helpful. The service is quick.
The menu is really good and pocket friendly. It gives you a variety of options.
We tried the chicken original patty burger, chicken wings in bbq sauce, fried chicken burger, chicken wings, French fries, curly fries and coke. The quantity and quality are both worth the money
Loved the curly fries. They were crispy and very tasty. Must try!"
American Wild Wings,Rajini Kanth,16 October 2018,5,"Loved the wings!!!!üòä Great Environment With Great Taste, Best Serve, Wings Biryani tastes Excellent , I recommend to go with your friends and have a great meal."
American Wild Wings,Pramit Bandyopadhyay,08 October 2018,4,"I ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
Quantity was satisfactory.
Packaging of the food was good. I really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. Some may call it excessive packaging however.
The fries were warm and well salted. But they were not crispy. This could be the fault of delivery, so I am not upset. Only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
The wings were covered in brown gravy. I was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. While the wings were certainly not bad, I did not enjoy it very much.
I would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself."
American Wild Wings,Jyoshna Reddy,07 October 2018,5,"I had wings with Mexican Jerk...it tastes Delicious.quantity is more and food is awesome.
Quantity- 5/5.
Food-5/5.
Will visit restaurant soon as the ambience looks very good in the photos."

Domino's Pizza,Upasana Motani,18 May 2019,1,"I have ordered from Dominos all my life, but no store has ever been this bad.
The order arrived in 45 mins, all my food had completely cooled down.
I asked the delivery boy about their 30 mins policy, and he gave a very casual answer saying ""ma'am parking me late hogya, jaane do"" I tried to argue saying that its not my problem and he agreed to give me a 300 rs refund. I asked him to do it at the moment and he said, his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done. 

I talked to his manager on the phone, and he completely denied my refund. 
He didn't care about customer service, he talked very rudely, and he said he's not going to follow the policy. He also said I don't care if you accept the order or return it.
(If this was the case, why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off?)

People like this don't deserve to be a part of DOMINOS.
They're completely ruining the franchise image."
Domino's Pizza,Ankur Sharma,15 May 2019,1,Pathetic service . Food arrived in 2 hours cold and no apology from the restaurant . Very bad customer care service from zomato and dominoes.
Domino's Pizza,Vaibhav Singh,12 May 2019,1,Worst experience at dominos. No air conditioner at the store is working (out of 5). It was too hot. No one cared about it. It took too long to get the tables cleaned.
Domino's Pizza,Krishna,11 May 2019,1,I ordered pizza with extra cheese but there is no extra cheese in it. I cant imagine dominos can do such a pathetic job. I am totally dissatisfied
Domino's Pizza,Farhaan Nasir (bankruptfoodie),07 May 2019,1,"Domino's doesn't live up to the standards any more. I ordered a pizza and it was late with a delivery time of 1hour with a promised delivery of 30 Mins. Once I got the pizza it was smashed.. When asked for a refund they said they will give me ""Domino's"" credits. However I didn't get the credits as well. Also I don't want domino's credits. I want my money back. I will never order from dominos again and would advise that they shut down at least this store since they are not able to live up to the standards.
Attached images of the smashed pizza."
Domino's Pizza,Sai Sujan,02 May 2019,1,"Very worst taste I have ever had in my life. Even compared to others like KS Bakers, Karachi bakery Pizza are better than this. Don't want to refer."
Domino's Pizza,Vikrant Gupta,21 April 2019,1,I ordered 2 pizza from here via zomato. First of all i got my order after 1 and half hour and worst thing is i got the pizza which i haven‚Äôt ordered. It was not expected from the dominos.üôÅ
Domino's Pizza,HARSHA G,21 April 2019,3,The order delivered was not so satisfying because the pizza was not enough hot to catch up the taste of it. Hope i get it right next time when i order.
Domino's Pizza,Sundranipinky,05 April 2019,1,"Pathetic experience
Never order from this outlet
They neither deliver the order nor refund your money
I ordered at around 9pm from this outlet and waited till 11 i never received my food
Also all the help line numbers they provide are either wrong or not reachable
Highly disappointed"
Domino's Pizza,Priyanka,16 March 2019,2,Garlic bread was half cooked
Domino's Pizza,Moonis Ahmed,15 February 2019,1,"Ordered a pizza, garlic bread and other stuff on 14th Feb at 9 pm through Zomato. ZOMATO shows order is in the kitchen. But no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.

I anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)

1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

2. Dominos hotline is worthless. No clue on if their branch actually has a working phone or not."
Domino's Pizza,Jyothi,27 January 2019,5,All time favourite. My favourite is pepper barbecue and stuffed garlic bread. High quality with reasonable prices .no other pizza can dominate Domino's pizza
Domino's Pizza,BE Happiee,04 January 2019,1,It is waste to order pizza from this restaurant. I forgot that I have preferred a cheese burst pizza. There is no cheese in pizza and moreover the diameter of uttappam is far better than this pizza. I will never prefer this
Domino's Pizza,Shiva Chintu,25 December 2018,5,taste is good..
Domino's Pizza,Adil PR,25 December 2018,4,The pizza if eaten at the restaurant is very good. Home delivered pizza are somehow tasting pale. Otherwise the pizza is the best out of all the pizzas I have had lately.
Domino's Pizza,Priya Pandita,15 December 2018,5,As always tasty and excellent.
Domino's Pizza,K V Krishna Rao,09 December 2018,3,"According to the message I got from dominos , the delivery executive was supposed to deliver the pizza at the door, despite of me mentioning the complete address, The man came at the wrong place and called me outside. They should never mention door delivery if they wanna deliver it outside."
Domino's Pizza,Monica Mittal,07 December 2018,1,I am still waiting for the pizza
Domino's Pizza,Milind Sheth,07 December 2018,1,"The pizzas were delivered to me after 2 hours of placing the order and they were cold. Inspite of raising a complain 3-4 times, I did not receive any customer support and wasn't even contacted by their supervisor. Needless to say, I wasn't even reimbursed for the late delivery and cold pizzas."
Domino's Pizza,Pavan Kumar,06 December 2018,1,"I had been waiting 1 hour 26 min to receive my order and I didn't get any information from Zomato as well as Dominos, the contact numbers that mentioned in the message didn't work at all. Finally I got a call from delivery guy after 1 hour and he said will be there in 3 min. But still waited 26 min infront of my gate to see the delivery guy. The worst thing was I couldn't eat that pizza since it was harder than the packing box"
Domino's Pizza,Sakthi,09 November 2018,5,good and polite
Domino's Pizza,Sakshi,13 October 2018,2,less cheese in cheese burst
Domino's Pizza,Syed Aaquib,11 October 2018,5,The delivery was faster than expected. I couldn't believe I got a call just 5 minutes after I placed the order and the guy was at the doorstep
Domino's Pizza,Sai Teja,30 September 2018,5,on time delivery.! and great pizzas. thanks Zomato ü§ó
Domino's Pizza,Ankit Anand,24 September 2018,1,In short it was pathetic. They will mark the order as delivered from there side only . Though it will never get delivered to you. Not the first time and there contact is always find not reachable and it seems they have open an outlet under water or inside an elevator.
Domino's Pizza,Zainab Saba,24 September 2018,5,"Great service, quick delivery!

Mohammedia Shawarma,Sarath.17.04.1993,24 May 2019,4,Best shawarma served at reasonable price and the mayonnaise is simply awesome.rumali shawarma with/without salad is the best one till date .!
Mohammedia Shawarma,Jayakar Reddy,21 May 2019,1,"WASTE RESTAURANT...
I ordered special chicken shawarma, but there is no cheese & getting rotten smell in it... It has happened several times, Even ZOMATO people unable to help out. üñïüñïüñï"
Mohammedia Shawarma,ARUN NANI,29 April 2019,1,"Till now this is the worst shawarma what I tasted
Very very bad taste and worst
Very dry and oily this is the best in bad taste quality of a chicken is also very bad"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Mohammad Gulamqadar,22 April 2019,1,"Worst shawarma i have ever tasted

I believe they are providing 2-3 days old shawarmas

Iam saying this because when i have ordered here i got a shawarma with soaring smell even chicken was smelling"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Shaikh Shamim,19 April 2019,1,"(Strong recommendation- never ever order from here) - It was the worst experience I had attempted by ordering from here. I order special chicken shwarma. The chicken was spoiled and smelling badly, and by having one bite I thrown to garbage bin."
Mohammedia Shawarma,Mohd Ahmed,06 April 2019,1,Plz dont buy this shawarma very cheap quality of food items they used and not fresh. If ther is negative maarking i will give them -10000. And very cheap paking
Mohammedia Shawarma,Koolaid Pickle.,05 March 2019,1,"These guys used to be really good at making delicious falafel and regular shawarma. Over the time, the quality seems to have dropped to an extent that the food smells bad and makes you feel sick.

The wrapping paper which they use to wrap these things in, sometimes sticks to your food. If I were you, I wouldn't eat here. Save your money and skip this place!"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Waseem Mohiuddin,15 February 2019,1,"horrible, I ordered 1 special and 2 regular shawarma. we got 3 regular shawarma. Pathetic experience. I'm satisfied with the person who delivered, please let him have the credit for the delivery"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Moh'd Noufal,09 February 2019,1,I ordered 2 shawarmas. But the Food was spoiled. They gave old stock. It was very hard. The Rumali rotti was sticky. My Stomach felt uncomfortable. I Vomitted. I don't trust this shop anymore. They are cheating the customers. Why do we pay money? Is this how they gibe offers and all? Online buyers are not dumbyards.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Tanveer Mansoori,09 February 2019,5,This is my n-th experience ordering the Shawarma for a quick bite. They are good with quality and taste of the food and I really liked the quick service of this restaurant late at night and even on weekends.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Vipul Bhatnagar,29 January 2019,1,"worst shawarma ever.. ordered three times from here and every single time i got yukkiest shawarma ever.. no mayonnaise, chicken smelling like hell and uncooked rumali roti.. never going to eat at this place.."
Mohammedia Shawarma,Jagadeeswar Reddy,24 January 2019,1,Please don't order from this outlet. They are delivering late and the taste is not at all good.i just ordered one chicken shawarma. They delivered it late and the food is spoiled. Less chicken more creames and salad. not even worth of rs10
Mohammedia Shawarma,Imran,14 January 2019,2,"Unprofessional and unhygienic. Shawarma fast food shops have sprang up in every nook and corner of the city but they typically have their setup on roads. Hygiene is never considered.

Ordered rumali roti shawarma... The bread was half cooked. I will avoid this place in future."
Mohammedia Shawarma,Sanchita Tripathi,13 January 2019,2,"I ordered a cheese falafel wrap. The wrap had no cheese. The falafel was deep fried in oil that was quite old and I could taste it in every bite which made it quite bad. Apart from that quantity wise it was quite good, but tbh quality matters too.

Would I order again? Not really"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Subhashree Dey,10 January 2019,3,I like this place for the mayonnaise they provide. It's really tasty and thick. The chicken with salad shawarma is good here. Though they can try making the rumali roti little more softer.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Karishma Anand,30 December 2018,2,"I have ordered shawarmas from this outlet more than a couple of times but today the shawarma which was delivered was very bad , the rumali wrap was hard and the filling had next to no chicken. never ever going to order from here again."
Mohammedia Shawarma,Saioni Sen,20 November 2018,3,shawarma is too small
Mohammedia Shawarma,Surya,19 November 2018,1,"They have mentioned as special chicken shawarma but nothing special in it and surprisingly no chicken in chicken shawarma. Quantity is also very less, Don't prefer this place for chicken shawarma. It's waste of money to order from this place"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Kr√Æ≈üh√±√£ Kr√Ø≈õh,17 November 2018,3,bad taste
Mohammedia Shawarma,Najeem Khan,16 November 2018,5,very good
Mohammedia Shawarma,Souptik Bhattacharyya,11 November 2018,1,Very poor quality food. Avoid this restaurant to save your money. Ordered Special Chicken Shawarma and something arrived like a wrap/sandwitch which was even sour in taste i.e. it was stored/rotten.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Viren Kundu,07 November 2018,1,"The place is more a storage room than a shawarma outlet.
Doesn't uphold the mohammedia standard.
The vegetables in the salad aren't fresh and the shawarma is packed sparingly with way too much mayo.
Supervise your shawarma if visiting"
Mohammedia Shawarma,Vishnu Prasad,05 November 2018,1,Please be advised of the tasteless crap load sold as shawarma. Filled with vegetable and nothing but tons of vegetables to make sure you won't complain. Perfect for one on diet or a vegetarian as they don't use much chicken. Its just roti filled with cucumber and tomato. kudos to the chef.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Richa Rathore,26 October 2018,5,"I would say it was one of the best shawarma that I have had till date. Thanks, would definitely order again from this place."
Mohammedia Shawarma,Siddhartha Sural,24 October 2018,1,Sorry to say but got rotten tomato and cucumber in salad with rotten chicken. Was smelling very bad. Could not eat it. Waste of money and time.

Mohammedia Shawarma,Nilabh Kumar,08 September 2018,1,This place serves you one of the worst shawarma in Hyderabad.. neither the chicken is properly roasted nor the roti is properly made.. one of the worst I have had..
Mohammedia Shawarma,Ramkrishna Sidral,08 September 2018,5,very good service
Mohammedia Shawarma,Osama Faiz,05 September 2018,1,I saw a rat roaming around in the outlet. I pointed this out to owner and he gave an unaffected expression. Avoid ordering food from this outlet.
Mohammedia Shawarma,Saubhik Bandopadhyay,04 September 2018,1,"They cancelled my order after 30 mins of payment. What kind of bullshit is this. I am leaving Zomato for sure, I am shifting to other apps.

Very bad service by Zomato they don't even have courtesy.

This is by far the worst service by any service provider by all means.

I have the entire conversation on phone recorded with their support team will give it in fb and FB pages."

Arena Eleven,Bhaskar Roy,18 May 2019,2,"I ordered Chicken Hakka, they gave us Chicken Chowmein absolutely white, blant and tasteless. I complained to the waiter who said thats the way they make it, yet he offered to replace with Chicken Schezwan noodles which I declined, as I wasn't sure to further ruin my taste n appetite. Cocktails were decent, non-veg platter was ok ok, couldn't differentiate between the taste in tikkas. I am grading down to 2 stars only because of the amateur Chowmein served in the name of Hakka."

Arena Eleven,Sulagna Sen,07 May 2019,1,"Yesterday we went to this place.

Service is very very slow even on a weekday. It took so much time for kababs to come.

Often they say, if you arrive late, make it grand. We hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it. But alas! the food is disgusting!

Not recommended at all. Go only if you're getting offer like more than 60% off.. Otherwise complete waste of money!"
Arena Eleven,Pralay Chakraborty,06 May 2019,1,"Today went to this place. I will be brutality true.. There's a reason why they are giving huge discounts via different booking/table reservation platforms.

Service : very very slow even on a weekday. Seems kitchen is highly understaffed.

Food: Pathetic! I am living in Hyderabad for last 10 years. I haven't had so pathetic kababs here in Hyderabad, like what I got at arena eleven.

Overall a BIG NO. Please don't waste your money here.

1. Ordered fish lemon pepper kabab.. It was too salty.

2. Ordered chicken tikka kabab. You can't even chew the chickn pieces, it was so hard & tasteless.

3. Ordered a mocktail for my wife, it was full of water instead!!"
Arena Eleven,Sushree Sarita,05 May 2019,2,"The food here was ok. But the service was worst ever. If you have 3-4hrs free time to spend then come here. The service is slow as sloth. We ordered starters got it after 30min. Then got lunch after an hour. I guess they forget orders after you give them, you have to remind them atleast twice or thrice to get it."
Arena Eleven,The Hungry Indians,03 May 2019,4,"Arena eleven
This place is all about kebabs beer and sports
Located in SLN terminus mall
This place has both indoor and outdoor seating
Outdoor view is beautiful
And they have around 10 screens
After all this place is about sports
.
.
They are serving buffet and a-la-carte
And they are running 50% off during day time
In food we have tried
Chicken kebab platter : 12 kebabs and priced at 540 is very economical
And tasted quite good
.
Veg primevara pizza : lots of veggies topped on thin base loaded with cheese
Tasted great
.
Veg sheek kebab : üëéüëé
Has to be fried properly
.
Honey chilli chicken wings : spicy but not so sweet
Served hot üî•üî•
.
Sizzling chicken tikka biryani : had no expectations on biryani here but it turned out good
And chicken tikka pieces were soft
.
.
In mocktails we tried
Fruit sangria and mango margarita
Fruit sangria is made of cranberry juice and oranges & green apple
Mango margarita is the best mango mocktail we ever had
A must try here
.
In cocktails peach martini was good"
Arena Eleven,Tanya Karanjai,01 May 2019,4,"Arena eleven sports bar

IPl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar! There aren't many sports bar around and Arena Eleven is the swankiest ones in town. Located in the SNL terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.

AMBIENCE (4/5): The seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. They have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. Beautifully designed restro, Arena Eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. They have some good tracks playing which I liked as well.They have indoor as well as outdoor seating.Outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.

FOOD AND BEVERAGES ( 4/5) :

You can opt for either ala carte or buffet.The place has both options.

Mocktails and cocktails : In mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. This had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. Then we tried Mint Julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. It was decent.Zen Zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. It was nothing special and was too sweet.Virgin mojito was as it should be.

In cocktails we tried Old Fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. This one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had Kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and Cinnamon. It was a delightfull drink.Then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. This drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.

Food:

1. Veg manchaow soup : The soup did not appeal my pallate . It was moreovee tasting like rasam than a Chinese soup.

2. Tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.

3. Tandoori non veg sizzler : This was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.

4.Tandoori veg sizzler : This had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.

5. Hot wings : The hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. This was a disappointing one

6.Tandoori chicken tandri : Tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.

7. Masala Fries : This is a very new concept which I tried for the first time. The masala fries were served with chopped onions.It was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.

8.Chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.

8. Chicken Tikka Pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. This was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. The crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.

9. Chicken seekh kabab : I absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.

10. Veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.

11. Chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. The consistency was also creamy. The taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.

12. Chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. The hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.

DESSERTS

1. Gajar ka halwa : I absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. Warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.

2. Kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.

The place is really nominal with good food. With this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended."
Arena Eleven,Mohammed Masih Uddin (Hyderabadi Food Therapy),01 May 2019,4,"Arena Eleven - A Sports bar which is located at Kondapur at Level 3 in SLN terminus has got varieites of Kebabs and buffet system. Coming to the amibence - They have got 2 big screen's for live sports screening, They have got good music which is not loud (pretty impressive). Staff is very friendly. The waitress who attended us has been very kind to us and made sure that everything was perfect for us. They have got indoor and outdoor seating as well.

Arena Eleven,Mohit Gupta,01 May 2019,4,"Yesterday,I went with my friend to arena eleven. Best thing was ambience and atmosphere. Service was damn slow. Even bill takes half an hour. We have ordered Pizza and Manchurian. Waiter forget our Manchurian. But taste was good. Overall, Food was good. We ordered 1 pint of beer and 3 30mL whiskey. Sadly, IPL match washed out. Food and drinks are quite reasonable price. All this cost 942 after dineout offer. My overall experience was good. Hope to experience better service next time."
Arena Eleven,Akshay,01 May 2019,4,"Was here few days back. The place was so busy and full. Had to wait a few minutes to get a table.

Staff were friendly and patient, got a table we requested.

Coming to the food ordered Chicken Nasheman Tikka, Stuffed Tangdi Kebab and Fish Tikka for starters. All tasted good. Tried Pina Colada Mocktail which was fine but don't go with spicy food.For Maindish we were suggested to take Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani and was tatsy as suggested.
Ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.

P.S. They may take quite a time for the dishes but don't get frustrated just sit back and enjoy the IPL screening on all the walls. Good thing is that you don't have to turn your head."
Arena Eleven,Javed Mohammed (The Food GlanZer),30 April 2019,5,"Arena Eleven, an sports bar with the theme menu of kebabs and beer with live screening of sports every day. Located in the sln terminus mall in level 3, cozy ambience well set up of giant screens and LED screens all over the restaurant as you cannot miss any single action of your sorts while eating the delicious kebabs and sizzlers. A pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu.

I have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite. Both of my experiences are much better then the before one.

My favorites at Arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters, the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle.

I Love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good.

Thai Green Curry with steam rice are one of my favorite, but just they need to be little consistent.

Chicken tikka biryani is the USP of arena eleven menu, it's really too good in taste and the quality.

I had the best non alcoholic Sangria here. It was the best so far, must try this.

Arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet, the spread is much worth at price of Rs: 550/-

Rice kheer is my favorite in desserts."
Arena Eleven,Bharti Mehta,30 April 2019,3,"Visited Arena 11 for a Sunday Branch. It was Easter Sunday and the place was packed. Also, since the IPL season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.

The have Sunday Buffet Brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. Though the presentation can be improved alot.

We also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.

At once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.

Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka, Honey Chilli Chicken Wings and Tangri Kebab were served.

The Lemon Fish Tikka and Tangdi Kebab were good but Honey Chilli Chicken Wings were too sweet for my palate.

The Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries were good.

In buffet, the Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani stood out.

Also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.

I suggest them to add some more variety for desserts"
Arena Eleven,Kamran Hussain Khan (Intensefoodcravingsblog),30 April 2019,4,"Arena Eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of Hitec city .There is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. The menu is extensive. There is plenty of waitstaff. Our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
We say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. The music selections were good, but not too loud.
The portions were very generous. .
There are many TV screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
An overall good atmosphere..They have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their Alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

Arena Eleven,Richa Mundhra,30 April 2019,3,It serves only kebabs. The ambience is nice but the service is very delayed. The offers are good related to meal options. Can work more on music and service.
Arena Eleven,Nayan Saha,27 April 2019,1,What to say...one of the worst restaurant in town. Real slow service. No management. No proper place to sit. Worst of all poor customer service. I was a regular visitor bt now the treatment I got makes me not to go again. I also had a corporate party scheduled yesterday trusting there service. But after taking money they didn't provide a table. My team stood there for almost 50mins. Later we were forced to walk out. They did refund the money bt had to go through alot before getting it back. Guys there are lot of good places for watching IPL. This is a shit place...u will end up destroying ur day. Pls refrain from going to this place.
Arena Eleven,Yash Kumar Singh,25 April 2019,3,"It's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. But not to worry as Arena Eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""Kebabs, Beers & Sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.

The menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely Veg Shami, Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.

Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab, Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.

Running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from. Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani. After the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis. Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average.

The service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. All in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.

Arena Eleven,Vasanthi Singampalli,24 April 2019,4,"Arena Eleven, nestled in SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, is a sports-themed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around. With two large screens and three televisions, no matter where your table is, you will be able to catch all the sporting action. During the day, the clarity of the large screens is lower, because of the bright light from the glass panes. The best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover. Perfect to enjoy the cool breeze, watch a match and hang out with friends. 
 The bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur. They serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains. The starters will be served to the table.
In the starters, we tried the Sizzling tikka platter which consists of Chicken Tandoori, lemon pepper Chicken, Tangdi Chicken, Paneer Tikka, Veg Seekh Kabab and Fish tikka. Tangdi Chicken made a perfect starter, soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection. Fish Tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors. In veg, don't miss out in Paneer Tikka. It was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused. Veg Seekh Kebab was good when we had it for the first time. But when ordered for the next time, it was very dry.
Apart from the Tikka platter, we tried Chicken 65, Honey chili wings, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish and Masala Fries. I loved all of them.

In the main course, from the buffet, they have two non-veg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread. Curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point. Ordered and tried their Thai Veg curry, which disappointed me, as it was too sweet. Chicken Tikka Biryani is a hit, It was as tasty as it looks. It was very different from the regular Hyderabadi Biryani yet very delicious. 
Tried the Butter Chicken Masala Pizza. Though the toppings were great, the pre-baked base which they used dropped the taste.

From desserts, they have Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. Tasted Ok-ish , not so great.

Drinks need some improvements, as some are very sweet.

If improved on the glitches in the food and drinks, its a great place to Eat, drink, socialize and watch your favourite sports live."
Arena Eleven,Anvith Devulapally,22 April 2019,4,"Rating: 3.5

Replacing Serafina, Arena Eleven is a new addition to the SLN Terminus mall. With TV screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia, the place is a crowd-puller during this IPL season. The place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden.

Our Sunday lunch started with a few drinks. Mint Julep, Virgin Mojito, Virgin Sangria, Virgin Pina Colada, Zen Zero - a mojito like drink with cola, Calvados - their version of a hot toddy, Old fashioned and Kentucky Apple Cinnamon. Though the cocktails were potent, they lacked finesse. Mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down. The better ones of the lot were Calvados, Apple Cinnamon and Mint Julep.

In the starters, we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken, lemon pepper, malai, nasheman, paneer and fish tikkas. The stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas. We also tried their Tangdi kebab, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish, salt and pepper wings, chicken 65, honey chili wings, chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce, masala fries, chicken and veg sheek kebabs. One thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency. Our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more. The second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless. The tangdi kebab was well made. Soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor. The chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious!

I visited this place twice. During the first visit, I tried the Chicken peri peri tikka roll, Chicken Rajiala, Onion Kulcha and Thai Green Chicken curry for mains. The roll was passable. We were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn't really prove to be. It tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry. Nothing special. The thai green chicken curry blew us off with it's flavors. Each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together, it was magic! Pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons! During the second visit, we chose to eat the mains from their Sunday buffet and it was not a great decision. Except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani, the rest were tasteless. We also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre-made base and tasted substandard. We ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet.

They only had a couple of desserts in both instances - Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer. They were just run-of-the-mill kind and didn't have any oomph factor.

Overall, one thing that the place needs is consistency. Their tag reads Kebabs. Beer. Sports but the kebabs part isn't really justified. Service is decent. They need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace. They have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset!

They also gave us the complimentary Kheer. My rating:

Arena Eleven,Shreshth Malhotra,22 April 2019,4,"Arena Eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city. Located inside the SLN terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs.

I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet. First things first, their Buffet layout was well spread. The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. The drinks offered by them included Mojito, Zen Zero and Mint Julep. The drinks were average and needs quite improvement.

Speaking about their starters, I had their Chicken Tangdi, Malai Paneer tikka, Salt and Pepper prawns, Lemon pepper Chicken tikka, Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab.

Amongst all the starters, I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab. The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. Next up, I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka. It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.

For mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal, Assorted breads, Biryani and Salads. The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala. I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. For veg, their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala. I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.

Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me. It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. Apart from this, I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry. It was served with steamed rice. To be honest, the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. Maybe, they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry.

For desserts, I had their Gajar ka Halwa, Kheer and Ice cream. The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.

All in all, the place has got a huge potential. All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. Happy eating. :)"
Arena Eleven,Suptikanta Mohapatra,20 April 2019,3,"It looks like a sports bar with proper setup. But the people around did not seem to be sportive, especially on a Friday night :P. Service was a bit on the slower side. Ambiance was good. Now coming to the main part, the food.

Sizzling non-veg Tikka Platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
Jamaica Chicken Tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
Nasheman Chicken Tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
Malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
Bhuna Chicken - one of the best I have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
Chicken Rajiala - A green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was too good especially for Chinese lovers
Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. Chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
Ginger Coke - Please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

Overall was a good experience."

Arena Eleven,Raja Srivathsav,12 April 2019,4,"They‚Äôve opened up recently and I think they have a long way to reach good management.
Other than beer, I‚Äôve tried their LIT and a classic martini!
They‚Äôve got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar.
Food was delicious.
I‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
As per the guy who served us, Jamaican and Nasheman was their speciality.
So we ordered that platter with Jamaican, Nasheman and Malai fish tikka.
Jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
Nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
Malai Fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

The only problem I faced was table management.
Each time I had to order, I literally had to shout and wave my hands multiple times to get someone‚Äôs attention to my table.

I enjoyed that moment with drizzle and my drink.
I tried some fish item, I forget the name of the dish ..its finger licking dish. And tangidi biryani was taste less, no salt, no masala, may cheif might forgotten to add all these.
IPL or PL or UEFA in Arena...you love it with crowd"

Tried sizzler kabab platter, veg pizza, gobhi Manchurian and hakka noodles - all tasted good!
Ambience - average to good."
Arena Eleven,Surya Mukherjee,04 April 2019,4,Visited for a lunch buffet with my office colleagues. I have booked table using dineout where I got 50% off (300/-) on lunch buffet which was definitely a great deal. We were 14 members altogether. We were served welcome drinks and followed by starters. Which was nicely cooked. Then we approached towards main course. Although I didn't try much because I was already full with starters. I tried their desert which was nice. Overall a nice place for dining out. But I think this place should be visited at night while watching football match or some IPL match with beers and kebabs. Great place to hangout.
Arena Eleven,Jahnavi Manem,02 April 2019,4,"I visited yesterday with my friend for lunch as we both were starving very badly...we choose buffet.It started with the chicken sweet corn soup and the starters were so yummy especially the chicken 65 and the honey baby corn that were A grade dishes.The chickn biryani was a good option for the main course.Ambiance was really pleasent and also a hangout with friends especially during cricket matches as it does have live screens all over the place!

Arena Eleven,Vishnu Kaluvala,25 March 2019,4,"Been there yesterday dinner, the place is ideal for sports lovers, it has live screening and outdoor seating tooo the service is prompt and the prices were minimal can go with 1500 bugs in pocket for 2 people ."
Arena Eleven,Arpa Ghosh,23 March 2019,2,"I visited this place with my wife on 16 March,2019.  Its located in SLN terminus. We were looking for a place to dine after our movie at Platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. Was it worth it, lets find out.

Ambiance
============
We entered this place around 10 pm on a Saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd. They have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from Cricket to Premier League Football. We were promptly seated at the Verandah. The view from there is quite something. We got seated in a semi lit corner. The place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. Liked it. Ratings - 4/5.

Service
============
Pathetic. Needs a lot of improvement. They took some time to produce the Menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. We ordered food and drinks. The food was delayed and drinks just did't come. We had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. Luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. When asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. Phew! Ratings - 1/5.

Food
============
Did food proved to be the Savior for the night? Read on.  We ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of Pinacoladas(Yes, we took advantage of Gold membership). The virgin mojito was pathetic. Period.  The Pinacoladas were really good. We ordered for Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter, which was strictly okay.  Well the service and food really disappointed. Ratings - 3/5.

Value for Money
=============
We shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. High pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. So no way its VFM. Ratings - 1.5/5.

Let's calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 2.375

Final Thoughts
=============
This place has all the potential to be nice a sports bar, and I feel that their service and food really needs improvement!"
Arena Eleven,George B.,22 March 2019,3,"Experience at Arena Eleven... Since it‚Äôs in SLN Terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!

Ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.

Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!

When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.
The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

Arena Eleven,Bhuvan Bhatt,18 March 2019,1,"One of the worst experience I had. Staff is not trained well and manager on-site is not at all worried for customer experience. Even though I booked a table, I was not provided one. Service guys are not bothered to ask if customer needs anything even if restaurant was not full. one of my ordered food was not even provided and what was provided that was stale and when asked manager was very rude with his replies. I left the restaurant in the middle as except bira beer everything was pathetic even in last Management guy declined to provide me the bill and was VERY VERY rude, waited for around 15 minutes after paying the amount just to get the bill. Avishek and ajit were the two guys handling the overall management the day I went. hope you guys have improved now and not giving same experience to others."
Arena Eleven,Dev Mohanty,17 March 2019,5,Best place. Nice ambiance. Staff so humble specially Abhisek and nice. Best place to hang out with at the week end. Must visit. Lots of verifies in cocktails.....
Arena Eleven,Ashutosh Choudhari,17 March 2019,4,"Went for lunch buffet.
Ambience was good with very nice choice of music. Night view would be very nice.
Choice of starters was limited but the taste was good. Chicken kebab with a tinge of lemon was the best. However fish was undercooked.
Surprisingly main course was quiet tasty with chicken tikka masala being the best.
On the dessert side, kheer was a spot on.
At the end i would like to tell the worst part of my experience which was the service. An utter dissapointment.
The waiter's arguing behaviour and careless service ruined my mood. I would ask the owner to please teach some basic behaviour to this waiter. I dont know his name but i think he is just ruining his fellowmates career as well.
Because the food n ambience was good, overall I would rate this 4.2/5."
Arena Eleven,Alekhya,15 March 2019,4,"Paneer kebab was yummy
Tofu curry was ok
Naans were lip smacking
Food9/10
Ambiance was good ,can rate 8/10
Service was too late ,i rate 5/10"
Arena Eleven,Swaroop,13 March 2019,4,"Was quite skeptical about Arena Eleven, the place being a newbie.
Chose this over some top restaurants at SLN Terminus and I must say I wasn't disappointed.

The buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items. Food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet.

Ambiance is quite good with Indoor and Outdoor seating, the place was fully packed on a Weekday afternoon.
It has 2 screens and 5 TVs for sports viewing üëç

Service could've been better, the staff seemed quite confused and unresponsive sometimes.

*The buffet offers great value only If you use the offers on Dineout*

Overall:
Food:3.75/5
Ambiance:4.5/5
Service:2.5/5
Value For Money:4/5"
Arena Eleven,Asad Khan,13 March 2019,3,Overall a good place for hanging out during cricket and football matches cause of the ambiance. The food is good as well. We had the kebab platter which was delicious. The masala French fries were hot and crispy. The egg noodles were a good option for the main course. The chicken tikka biryani was disappointing though. The Air conditioner was not open at 4 30 in the afternoon which made it a humid experience.
Arena Eleven,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'",11 March 2019,4,"Visited here during dine out offer period.

Ambiance: The ambiance here is nice and pleasant. The restaurant is a sports themed restaurant with live screenings of match. There is an outside sitting area as well with the pleasant view of the botanical gardens. T

Food: 

ü•£Soup: Chicken hot and spicy soup: I have to admit that this is one the items that i loved the most of this place. There is no shortage of chicken pieces in the soup unlike other outlets and the soup is also a perfect combination of spiciness and sourness.

Starters: Honey baby corn, chicken tikka, paneer fry, fish.
üå≠A

üç® Dessert: Loved the gajar ka halwa and it was melting in mouth with the perfect sweet taste garnished with cashew nuts.
Ice cream was another item."
Arena Eleven,Ahmed Pasha,10 March 2019,5,"We just had a lunch buffet , awesome food and friendly staff .we like baby corn , fish tikka , tangdi kebab,and gajar ka halwa, great hospitality definitely we will visit again .thank you so much"
Arena Eleven,Naresh Adabala,08 March 2019,5,Best place to hang out I am here with my friends .nice ambiance and the live screening also good. Nice food music also pretty good and best part is out side
Arena Eleven,Sanjay Soni,07 March 2019,5,"Last Friday was awesome in arena 11.Good food and good music and the staffs are also so friendly
The out side view is so nice good place to hangout with friends"
Arena Eleven,Satya,05 March 2019,5,Grate buffet too good staters and music and service most try all most 9 staters is given fish and chicken most try ambiance also good sports
Arena Eleven,Srichandra Chilappagari,04 March 2019,3,"Went here on a Saturday night. Decent ambience and good music. We had baby corn mushroom masala, naan and Egg Hakka Noodles. Food was not that great üëéüèª"
Arena Eleven,CA Varsha Choudhary,25 February 2019,5,"Best place to hangout on weekdays as well as weekends. Food is the best catch here. Good music, good ambeince, good feels, good location. Nice service. A must visit place."
Arena Eleven,Payal Puri,25 February 2019,5,A perfect place to hang out with good service and good food! It's a bit busy during lunch hours but otherwise the place has it all that takes it to be a perfect place to eat and spend quality time with your friends or family! We tried our hands on Chicken curry and Prawns which were delicious and perfect for a Punjabi palette like mine!

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Prerna,22 May 2019,1,"So, it's our first time in Hyderabad and we thought of having a great meal at Radisson! We visited Cascade and much to our disappointment we found the food not even close to being great! The vegetarian spread was very less with just 4 starters and that too of similar type! Non vegetarian variety was better than vegetarian but was also not up to the mark. Thought of making peace with the situation by hoping that the desserts would at least be nice, but they too weren't nice.
One of the worst experiences of all times!
To top it all, the air conditioner was not working ! Definitely not going to visit again."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Raghava Ramesh,21 May 2019,5,"Went there for dinner in the weekend and had a very good experience. Their focus on customer service is highly commendable.

On the fourth day, I noticed that ""Naan"" wasn't available at the counter but when I enquired it, they immediately arranged it at my seat promptly. 

Chef Tarunima was checking with all the customers and educating them on the availability of live counters. 

Overall an excellent service, looking forward to joining again with family.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Aravind.kottapalli,01 March 2019,5,Very Tasty food we had so far. Staff caring is good. Hospitality is very good. Me. Salim and Naresh taken good care through out our dinner time.
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,George B.,24 February 2019,3,"Sunday brunch experience at Cascade-Radisson. It was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated, I‚Äôll describe in the review.

Service was really good, one of the best. Mr. Salim and staff really did a great job to host us. Plus point for them!

Ambiance instead was a total let down, at least for us. Floor was dirty (as you can see in some pics), chairs were dirty, even the water bottle was dirty. The restaurant itself has nothing special, no atmosphere... just bland. If you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a NO NO!

Food was on the good side. It had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou. Starters were average as desserts. The best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles. All other items are usually like everywhere, salad counter, pizza and pasta counter etc. With some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste.

When it comes to the price for the buffet I think is too expensive. Most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it!
Food 3/5
Ambiance 2/5
Service 5/5
Value 3/5"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Nillu,22 February 2019,3,I have been this on last Sunday .

Specially if you are a vegetarian then it not a good place for you ....
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Priyanka,19 February 2019,4,"We went for a buffet at Radisson. They had varieties of dishes. So few dishes were very food and few was below average. The starters were cold, we didnt feel like eating much. Main course was quite good.. Service was amazing, the staffs were extremely polite.. They had this live counter serving alu tikki and pizza but we didnt like the pizza at all. Deserts were nice, there were so many varieties in deserts. Overall a fine experience..

Thank you so much Abhinav you made my day."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Karishma Bhatt,01 February 2019,1,"One of the most pathetic and tasteless food i ever had. This 1 rating is also only because of ambience. Remaining things just shit. I went for buffet here having lots and lots of expectations, but all waste. I didnot understand still what cuisines or what food they are trying to serve ! First of all , all the menu in the buffet were cold, i felt like i am eating a day before's food. Not at all fresh. You will find lots and lots of varities in buffet, but when it comes to taste, disappointed. It was completely waste of money. Services and hospitality was somewhat good. But i am not at all happy with this place. To the Management ,here is request Please Change your menu and the way you cook. There are many other places which serves far better food. I cannt even think to visit this place again.

I want to mention special thanks to Salim, who is the head of the hospitality there and Nischit who took care of us for almost 2 hours 30 mins. I don‚Äôt have any complaints, from the starters to deserts everything was so perfect, it was a perfect wedding anniversary, never forget this. Thoroughly enjoyed to the core, I would recommend everyone to try, bill was just 2100 rs, as he gave discount of 20% which I didn‚Äôt believe initially. Thanks again Salim. It was amazing"

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Emiron,16 January 2019,4,"Enjoying my last hours in this hotel.
The staff is very helpful. I really had a nice time staying here. The rooms was great... shower was perfect. They cleaned the room everyday.
As for the restaurant staff... i have to say that Pranika was very very polite and she gave me a good feeling. Anything i wanted she helped me with it. i can say that by far she made me feel at home. The only thing that was a little bit frustrating....was the fact that the wifi wasn‚Äôt working properly everywhere in the hotel. Maybe a little thing for the hotel management to work on.
But the fact that the wifi wasn‚Äôt working properly will not hold me back to recommend this hotel.
I will give this hotel 4 stars. üòÄ"

Will definitely recommend to family and friends!!"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Rahul Agarwal,20 November 2018,3,"We went for the buffet lunch at Radisson after a few years. The overall experience was very average. There were events going on and the place was overcrowded. Very few staff to help/assist.
Coming to food, some items on the buffet were decent. The basics liike Paneer curry, lacha paratha etc were good.
Salads and chaats were OK.
Desserts were below average.
The one thing that is usually safe is a pizza. They had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet. Unfortunately they couldn't get the pizza to taste decent. I had to leave pizza and eat something else, which I never do.
Poor experience overall and unlikely to return again."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Abhinaya Talasila,19 October 2018,5,"Been here for a breakfast buffet! They‚Äôve a widespread of North Indian and South Indian varieties.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Jimut Deblaskar,30 June 2018,3,"This seemed to me as mainly buffet focussed - breakfast, lunch and dinner - staying guests being the main clientele. I‚Äôve had a few meals here and couldn‚Äôt complain. Standard fare with many options laid out which probably won‚Äôt wow you, but you‚Äôll find a few things that you‚Äôll like.

Their service is really good and I find the ambience very relaxed. The a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Epicurean Tales,27 June 2018,4,"I was staying at the Hotel Radisson and so got a Complimentary buffet breakfast along with my stay. This review is about that experience.

I went there along with a friend and it proved very tough to find an empty table as the place was crowded with guests. After a wait of 10 minutes we found our table.

First impressions about the Buffet was that the spread was huge and also contained many live counters. It had a nice mix of South Indian, North Indian and Continental dishes.

I tried many of their dishes but the items I liked the most here are Palak Idly, Cheese Omelette, Chicken Sausages, fresh Grape juice, White Chocolate Berliner and Black currant Yogurt.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Right Fooodies,15 May 2018,3,"Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi-cuisine dishes.

The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical. An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies. Cascade is in Gachibowli main road.

It‚Äôs located on the second floor of the property. While the lobby is inviting, it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby. As you enter Cascade, you are greeted by a Buddha Statue.

As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side. we had a few veg and non -veg salad, sausage with spinach. Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused. The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself.

Actually, none of the salads were any good, partly because they weren‚Äôt fresh - something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad ‚Äì ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù.

Starters : We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. They had little variety of but not so tasty starters.

Anyway, rushed towards main course ‚ÄòDal makhani‚Äù which was waste. Or in another word, I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor. And I feel, in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right!

Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry. I must appreciate, mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better.

For desserts, it's a good mix of Indian (including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha) and European delicacies.

I am not much of a dessert being, but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet.

Overall, I will not call it astonishing stuff, but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Amar,05 May 2018,2,"Went there for a dinner buffet. Highly disappointing. Firstly, they quoted wrong price over the call. On top of it, there were very limited items in the buffet. The ones that were there were mediocre as well. We felt a road side dhaba would have been better."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Tkv,25 March 2018,5,"The largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in Hyderabad. I was surprised by the choices on offer. Spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast.
- cereals, breads, pastries
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages
-idli, dosas,Uthappa, vada with different condiments
- Chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
I have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

Service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. I won‚Äôt hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Saswati Kar Choudhury,14 March 2018,3,"Been there for team lunch..I had expected a lil
More from this restaurant but it wasnt upto it.They had lil vareity of not so tasty starters..main course was better though..they had good vareity of sweets fr sure..overall it was good but can inprove over the taste!"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Palash Verma,10 March 2018,3,"Was here with the office team for buffet dinner and drinks and couldn't find much varieties on table. 4 points for taste, 4.5 for service and 2 points for their dismal amount of variety. You don't get much brand choice in drinks either."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Rohan Kichlu,04 March 2018,4.5,Good food and great service. They are consistent in their food offering with polite service and the breakfasts are quite busy here on weekdays. Keep up the efforts.
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Kedar Deo,19 February 2018,3,"Date : 14-Feb-2018 @9.30 AM 

Was staying at this hotel so had breakfast at this diner. A decent place , usual breakfast buffet that you find in such a place. The service is good but food and ambience is average. The good part is that the place is spacious."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anjan Goswami,09 January 2018,4,"We came here for a buffet dinner over the weekend and it was a blast!

Ambiance: Well it's Radisson, so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road. On the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it. The spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and non-veg starters on one side and main course on the other side. Live chat, breads and ice-cream counters on the side. There are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting. The place looks really good.

Food: First of all the spread was amazing. We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. The fish was really good and I enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken. 

In main course we had lamb stew, jamaican jerk chicken, kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice, steamed rice, noodles with veg and non-veg biryani. For vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala, dal, baked veggies and few other options. The best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao. I also tried the samosa chat which was quite good.

Finally came the desserts. There were cakes, halwa, macaroons and various other items. The macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake.

All in all a very nice meal with a lot of options and great service."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Coneenika Choudhuri,03 January 2018,4,"Exquisite buffet breakfast spread covering South Indian, North Indian, a bit of American and Italian cuisine with Gouda cheese. I had my first pesarattu there and yes, i loved it. I really wish they would serve pancakes too and most importantly have labels for dishes which are to be made to order. You must try their range of English desserts, croissants, donuts and biscuits. They also have an array of unique jams which would melt your heart with the soft bread. Overall a delightful experience.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Aarti Kamath,25 December 2017,4.5,"During our stay at Radisson, we had our breakfast here and it was very good experience compared to its peers in the area.

Breakfast review -

A typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone. There are about 10 Indian options like Idlis, wada, dosas to order, pav bhaji, puris, parathas to order, upma, poha etc. I couldn‚Äôt try everything, but the paneer paratha was very good and I totally recommend. The bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls, basic breads, butter/filled croissants, choices of donuts (excellent), cupcakes etc.! They also have several selections of beverages (hot and cold and soy drinks too), vegan options on request, variants of muesli and cereals, choice of cheese, salads, fruits, etc. They have western (cold cuts etc.) and Asian (noodles and rice) alternatives too!

Pros: Widespread buffet, most of the spread is very good in taste, helpful staff, comfortable seating.

Suggestion - Would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming.

Recommended ‚Äì Buffets!

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Vishnu Vardhan,14 December 2017,3.5,Good ambience and obvious reasons that it is 4 star hotel. Food options are good but tastes average. Starters obviously good in taste and main course is ok. According to taste not worth up to the price.
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Shrishail Deshnur,01 December 2017,3.5,Stayed at Radisson Hyderabad and got to experience this Restuarant. The dinner buffet spread was decent. It‚Äôs a multi-cuisine buffet but the Chinese options were real good. Deserts was pretty decent. The breakfast buffet is also a good spread. The Indian options were were tastier.
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Navya,30 November 2017,2.5,"I was here with my colleagues for a formal office dinner. The ambience and music is all good and suits the occasion but the food was a disappointment. Everything tasted just average but the price is too much. There were no desserts on the menu either. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a formal meeting where you do not care about the food much"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anuj Joshi,16 November 2017,2.5,"The story: Visited to celebrate my spouse‚Äôs birthday.

Ambience: The place was too bright for a fine dine. The presence of buffet right under the nose of fine diners was not really a good idea.

Etiquette: People were nice and professional. Expected minor surprise for the birthday girl as it happens in many fine dine restaurant when you book table in advance and mentioned what is the occasion.

Food: Moderately priced. However, they lack variety. For a fine dine, we expected a few new items on the menu but it wasn't. Taste wise food was good. However, the food doesn't tickle you taste buds.

Presentation: It was not too great. Mediocre not too fancy.

Verdict: You may visit there for a fancier place in comparison to standalone restaurant.

Pros: Price and location (in Hyderabad)

Cons: Food variety and taste."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Manikanda Pai,23 October 2017,3.5,"We went to Cascade for Birthday dinner and opted for buffet.

Ambiance: very beautiful. Not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it. 
Service: the moment you go in they had all the details as I had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior. 
Food: Very good spread. lot of options for salad. I went for the egg salad and the chicken salad. Very tasty.
Starters: good spread of veg and non veg. Very happy with the Hong Kong fish and zaffrani chicken. both were very tasty and must have. In veg crispy veg was a must have. Most of the starters were cold. Considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast. Moving on to the main course. another great spread and good options for veg and non veg. Fish was very salty so i had to pass that. other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try. Chettinad chicken was another must have. They had rotis and nans to order (live). I tried the Mongolian rice from the live counter. did not excite my taste buds much. Another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm. 
Some more options in main course was one veg biryani, Mutton biryani, chicken curry, Chicken curry was something I would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different. 
Desserts: another vast variety and i will give it 10/10. 

Overall: if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better. Overall I would recommend this place for a casual dining. if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be. 
Suggestion: I some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt. I mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again. for example. Soups is placed after the biryani. A little more organized would be good..."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Sabyasachi Raychaudhuri,13 October 2017,4,"A buffet with a nice spread and value for money pricing is always in demand. The ‚ÄúSpices Unlimited‚Äù buffet at Cascade, the all-day dining restaurant at Radisson Hitech City is an example of this. The newly revamped menu of this buffet, on for both lunch and dinner, ensures that everyone has something suiting his palate. Quite a number of live counters make this even more interesting.

The buffet is priced at an attractive Rs 1255 (all taxes included). Invited for a review of the buffet, I first did a recce of the items served. I was happy to note that huge spread had something for everybody. There were dishes from different cuisines, ranging from North Indian, South Indian, local Hyderabadi, Pan-Asian to continental. Live counters included those for dosa, ice creams as well as pasta and pizza. The dessert counter looked pretty extensive too.

Among the starters was Paniyaram, the round batter balls popular as a breakfast or snacks. This was served with three types of chutneys ‚Äì coconut, mint and tomato. I usually do not try veg starters but this was soft and good and the chutneys were delicious.
 

Other vegetarian starters included Potli Samosa, Kothmir Vada, and assorted vegetables in Chilli Sauce. Veg Sushis were also on display, but I did not try it.

Chicken Quesadilas filled with a nice stuffing and grilled was one attractive dish in the non-veg section. Fish Tikka was a little bit too spicy for me. Chicken Nuggets, Pepper Fish and Shanghai Chicken Dry were the other non-vegetarian appetizers.

The pizzas for the day included a simple Margarita as well as Chicken Pizza.I tried a couple of dosas from the live counter ‚Äì my choice was the Kheema Dosa though the Beetroot Dosa was a novelty too for its looks, like the coloured burgers which are in vogue these days.

The buffet also had an extensive salad bar with highlights such as Braised Chicken & Mushroom Salad and Roasted Lamb with Onion & Cabbage.

Over to the main courses. Continental cuisine seems to be a strong point of the chef team. The vegetarian main courses included Balsamic Grilled Vegetables, a dish which had babycorn, carrots and beans in a balsamic vinegar based sauce. The sweet and sour Vegetable Caponata was another dish of note. Lamb Ossobuco, an Italian main course of lamb shanks with a dark gravy was one dish that was really good. Poached Fish in a watery gravy did not have much of taste, the same applies for the Roasted Potatoes.

The Chinese part of the buffet had quite a good collection too. Fish Thai Red Curry went well with Szechuan Noodles. There was a vegetarian dish Mushroom & Bamboo Shoot in Scallion Sauce which also attracted my attention.

The Indian section had biryanis, both veg and non-veg which are must for any Hyderabadi buffet. The other local dish was Hyderabadi Fish Curry. From the Andhra kitchen, Kodi Koora and Ulavacharu made their mark. Maa ki Dal and Matar Paneer were the Punjabi dishes served.

I am not much of a dessert person, but was happy to see a large number of desserts in the buffet. Sweets included Shrikhand, Rasmadhuri and Hot Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. 
 

Overall, I will not call it extraordinary stuff, but it was a nice spread and a value-for-money buffet. The lunch buffet which I attended on a weekday had a huge rush, pointing to the popularity of the restaurant. The menu changes every day so that the regular clientele is provided with a change of taste.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Abhishek Singh Kshatri,01 October 2017,3,Not at all up to the mark disappointed ordered food to the room I am staying in and literally left it after having the first taste the presentation was good but food was bad
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Dinesh Rajagiri,30 September 2017,3,"An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it's kind. And when the food is unlimited, it's just bliss - a heaven on earth.

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.

Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

Strange I got what ever I want to eat in my plate as there are wide variety of dishes and customized food too. One will expect Radisson will have continental spread with continental style but nah Radisson became a local guy with excellent local tastes too. My biggest surprise with vada and Bamboo chicken biryani. Vada with chicken curry, bamboo chicken biryani with chicken gravy made my day. Wide variety of desserts are to a special mention. Hotel management is very friendly and helped to make our experience much better. Most recommended place if you are a lover of buffets."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Pink Ribbon,09 September 2017,4,"I was here for a day and enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Cascade on a Saturday morning. Unfortunately I didn't take any pics. But I must say there was a decent array of foods to satisfy many a palate - South Indian, North Indian, Continental cuisine. The staff stayed attentive throughout, clearing plates and serving everything that was ordered promptly. A great experience here."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Shivani Mohan,04 September 2017,3,"Cascade is a spacious coffeeshop with an extensive menu. We tried the lamb burger, club sandwich and spaghetti in tomato sauce. Food was fine although the chef forgot to add bacon in club sandwich. Spaghetti was yum. There was slight delay in service although staff came and apologised later. There were good breads available for sale although noone really encouraged you to buy. Staff lacks initiative."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Preethi P,27 August 2017,3.5,The place is amazing. The food is of huge variety. The view and cleanliness are appreciated. The live music is very entertaining. Food of all sorts are available. Best place for foodies. A must try in that area.

Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City has lauched an all-new buffet at their all-day dining restaurant Cascade and I was invited to try it out recently.

Being housed in a star property, the place has subtle interior designing, a great buffet area and a sprawling dessert counter with a mind blowing array of desserts.

While I loved the samosas, cheese calzones, a couple of Indian dishes from the buffet like the butter garlic naan and the curries, overall their food does leave a lot to be desired. Desserts such as black current ice cream and brownies were good.

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anupama Majety,24 May 2017,4,"I had been here twice in the last 2 weeks with my teams. The food served was good.
Things which I liked: 
- Number of starters and deserts are good
- Food taste is good and medium spicy.
- Offers different varieties of parathas
- Pizzas were served hot on table on request
- Pastas and fresh fries tasted good

Things which I did not like:
- Veg and non-veg items are clubbed every where and there is no demarcation. So need to be very careful.
- Buttermilk served was very bland and can be improved
- Items were not hot most of the time.
- Service was bad. They missed the pizzas ordered and had to be reminded again.
- Mint chutney tasted bad"
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Anand Radhakrishnan,14 May 2017,1,"Came here for some late night dinner and my experience can be termed ""Pathetic"" to say the least. They do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after 20 minutes of being there. The smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache. Although they claim it to be open 24 hours, they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight. Customers be damned! I asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell. After the food parcel was given, they wouldn't give me the cheque unless of course, again specifically asked for. The kind of experience you would expect from a place that serves biryani for Rs 50 and not Rs 800!! Endured the 40 minutes of torture, grabbed the take-away and left."
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Ram Raju,08 April 2017,4,Scrumptious buffet which reached my expectations. I can just say that best place to have a proper buffet with all the items good for both veg and non veg items. Great service. Pleased with their service. Ambience is simply cool..

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Alakesh Deb,22 April 2019,1,"I was excited about the team lunch at Hyatt, however, it turned out to be a disaster!

1. Food variety: Very less compared to any star rated hotels in similar bracket. We were offered only 2 types of Veg and Non veg starters and without even mentioning the dish name. No mutton items what so ever, neither in starters, nor in main course.

2.  The service was poor and slow. I am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff.
None of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good.
3. The quality of food changed with subsequent refill.  Even the ice creams were too sweet."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Meenakshi Mehra,19 April 2019,2,"Went for team lunch. Have been here in the past too but experience this time was not at all good. Food was not good especially the ones that were refilled. It appeared as if chef changed in between. Breads were too dense, desserts too sweet, chicken overcooked. Most disappointing was the service which is not at all expected from a brand like hyatt. Very slow service with a I don't care attitude. Had to wait very long for some of the requests. The only good thing was probably the decor. And no one will come back only for that."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Shreyansh Agarwal,15 April 2019,4,"I have been here for breakfast. Its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have, but I saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here. For me, a waffle cart was the best part. I just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup, nutella and berries compost. Do ask for a chef's special. The breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.
A few other things which I liked were the baked potatoes. Just loved them.
Another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. You had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. In the juices section, I could remember a carrot ü•ï ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. Detox water was another addition. Apart from these, you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you.
Find attached photos with this review to describe my experience in a better way."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Emmanuel Abhinav,11 April 2019,3,"Ambience: Peaceful place to hangout with a small group especially during late nights

Service: after two visits, I can say the service is consistent just like any other top hotels in the same league.

Food: Yes, I must say the burger is mediocre. I went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium. This patty has some herbs mixed in it, so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty, try it out.
For 850 rupees including taxes, I can say it‚Äôs on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger. 3.5 stars for their burger."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Anvesh Chowdary,04 April 2019,2,"I don't expect how people are maintaining the place. 

The service here was such pathetic I think Irani cafes on the roads have better service and delivery time of the service. 

Keeping the service aside the food is decent and the ambience and the pricing is decent but service is one of the worst I can expect from a star rated hotel.

If someone from the management is reading it kindly improve your service if you think there is a need."

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Shubham Jaiswal,03 March 2019,2,"Visited this restaurant thinking to have good food, but the efforts were wasted. We went on a Friday and we started eating the starters. After starters when we asked for main course, the staff told that on Friday they have only street food and no main course is available. Felt like we wasted our money.

Though the starters were good, but main course should also be there. Street food should be the add on and not the only food.

Two stars only for the ambience.

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Rachana Srivastav,27 February 2019,5,"I've had the breakfast buffet here quite a number of times and it is really a very good spread they have here.
They have 3 main live counters - one which makes fresh Dosas and Parathas, second makes the waffles and pancakes and the third makes all the egg varieties.
They also have a huge counter for fruits, juices and herbal shots.
Then there is the Indian food counter which has multiple varieties like - chicken curry or Keema curry with Pav, Idli and Wada with Sambhar and 3 types of chutney, Poha or something similar, and few more items.
There is also a counter which serves noodles, sauteed veggies, steamed fish or chicken and Chicken sausages, congee and Miso soup.
Then there is counter with cheeses, cold cuts, pre-made salad, some sweet jars, etc.
Then there's obviously the cereal counter and the breads counter which has amazing Danish bakery items, bread pudding and other baked breads.
That's a huge list!
To top it all, the staff is really courteous and polite and the outside seating is simply serene."

This place is quiet and comfy but infested with mosquitoes (last thing that u will expect from Hyatt). We ordered North Indian food which was quite yummy but the service was painfully slow. When u enter Hyatt, u don't expect this kind of treatment. Unfortunately, my date was ruined.
Will recommend others not to visit this place just because of Hyatt tag"

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Praveen Kumar Pappu,05 February 2019,1,"I would have rated a big 0 or -1 here if I can. its team lunch outing with 40 members. I'm reviewing this keeping in mind that we paid 1500 per person
Food :
there is no welcome drink. Even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice.
Starters : cold, not fresh, tasteless and very hard to eat. VEG: potato, Baby corn. Non-Veg : chicken, Fish
not even a smell of Prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu.
main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
Ambience : only tables and chairs are provided. no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table. just like a road side dhaba.
Service : too slow and no up to the expectations"
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Anand Seshadri,05 February 2019,1,"The Lunch served at Collage was way below our expectations.  Cold and lousy tasting food - only 2 varieties of items in the main course.  The soup served was cold.  They had only 2 main course items in veg and non-veg.  Not many varieties of Starters (only 2 Veg starters).  Desserts were minimum.   Ice cream varieties were only 2 (strawberry and chocolate flavors) When we asked for spoons for desserts, the waiters were looking at each other as if they don't know where the spoons are.  Service was poor."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Vijaya,05 February 2019,2,"Amid the busy lanes of financial district, lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset. A little ahead when you walk through the lobby, lies this very spacious restaurant. Very well managed place I must say. Spacious, well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting. The AC temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but didn't find much difference even after informing.

Service was slow and a little out of place. We asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us. The lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query. Next, we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced. But was never done. The rotis took a lot of time to come. Clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times. Asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served. Requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again, took away without informing.

Coming to the food, there's loads of choice. Except for a few items on the menu, nothing is worth a Hyatt standard. Loved the ariselu live counter. Shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite. Mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it. It was filled with bones. Also liked the varieties of rice available.

Overall, a place that could be so much more than what it currently is. If only this was better managed, it has the potential to be the best."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Rahul Khurana,22 January 2019,1,My worst dinner experience ever.. The buffet‚Äôs spread is the smallest you will find any where.. only 2 starters. Biriyani was horrible. Steamed rice was half cooked. The limited options of curry were also unpalatable. My friends had chicken and even that was half cooked. My money wasted.

And, this was at a time, when the only table occupied inside the restaurant was us. Outside, there were probably 2 tables occupied. Surprising that they couldn't manage 3 tables. Maybe this is a harsh review and there was an event happening at the hotel and they were understaffed., but, for a hotel chain like Hyatt, not acceptable."

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Pramila Padmanabhan,02 October 2018,1,"Sadly our visit to Hyatt wasn't the type one would want to remember. We were attempting to use Zomato gold - out of the 4 of us, 2 had gold and to start with they told us we would need to physically sit on different tables to use both gold memberships! Note : it was 2:30 at night and the WHOLE restaurant was completely empty. We suggested let's do two bills and create the notion of 2 tables if needed (why though I don't know, Zomato clearly says there is no limit of how many gold's can be used at a table) but even that was not agreeable, they just kept repeating we would need to physically move to two separate tables!! Needless to say, the visit just went down hill from there :(

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Rajani P,24 September 2018,4,"Had an amazing brunch at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad.

I generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it‚Äôs something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that I couldn‚Äôt resist clicking them. Each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship, delicately plated and arranged (esp for something at a buffet).

The food and spread were equally awesome. There was Sushi üòç, Mexican üòç, Indian, Asian and Pizza.

The Mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole, salsa, mango salsa and Parmesan. Didn‚Äôt explore the Asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos. The live counters consisted of pindi chole, several types of paranthas, appam & stew.

The sushi was good but not great, especially the wasabi didn‚Äôt have a strong flavor. But being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had.

The ambiance was really pleasant initially when we were seated. Later when we started sweating though we realized we were seated at a bad table as it was nearer to the door leading to the outside dinning area and that is where they also placed their live counters. Although they could close the door it was constantly getting opened and no one bothered to close it."

Classy ambience given it is Hyatt but I would rate the food a notch lower than it's pricier cousin in Banjara Hills. Food - Mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made. Tried Japanese style Udon noodles along with Japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter. I was later told that the noodles should be paired with Yamakazi whiskey and the curry with Jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste. It sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time. For dessert, brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item. Overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience. Worth visiting."

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Anupam Agarwal,31 March 2018,5,"Sometimes the most unexpected evenings can turn out to be the best one. Me and my wife both food lovers don't enjoy 5 star buffets and hence we avoid.
We ended up here as someone dear gifted us a couple dinner voucher and with just few weeks left for its validity we decide to give the place a visit on Thursday evening.
Closeby to our office we reached the place located in Nanakramguda just near the Amazon office and opposite Waverock.
We presented the voucher and they guided us inside with a preference of outdoor or indoor seating. We choose the former.
The ambience us very nice dimly lit with slow breeze.. would be even better during winter months.
We ordered for some cold drinks and went onto explore the buffet. A fine spread with a good assortment of Indian and continental dishes. One could take noodles and pasta from live counters.
Starters
Soups , salads , dimsum, fried chicken- the options for typical Indian starters are less- when enquired by the staff attending us about the quality we told them about the having less of Indian starters - they promptly arranged for some fried fish and chicken

Main course
Biryani rice, wet varieties of chicken, mutton and fish, one could lean into the continental side too with fried rice and noodles

Desserts
The best spread in Hyd from my experience. It ranged from variety of sweet bakery products to the Indians traditional sweets. None of them will disappoint you. People who have a habit of starting the buffet backwards are in for a treat

Overall we spent about 3 hours chit chatting enjoying the food and experience amazing service. Must recommended for people who want to just unwind after a hectic work day

Many service staffs take order and serve foods. All of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers. Especially, among these staffs, [Parmeshwar] and [Lalmalsawmi] have very good sense of service, and are outstanding to understand what customers really want.
From the moment of entry to the Collage to the exit, they really care about my moving path within the restaurant. In case of Parmeshwar, he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table. He always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood. He is always getting me things I ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something I ask for. He has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service. As for Lalmalsawmi, she always keeps an eye on me. She brings me chopsticks or Kimchi, depending on the food I order even though I do not ask. She knows how many ice cubes I like in a glass depending on the types of beverages I drink. She never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before I play golf because I drink a lot of water while I play golf under the smoking hot weather. This is something I even forget myself and that is why I really want to thank her. Generally, the grade of service from this restaurant is excellent, but as I mentioned above, I specially want to convey a lively sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Foodi Foodi,16 November 2017,5,"I have been staying at Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli for seven (7) weeks as of today.
First, my stay at this hotel could not be any better because of the services and hospitality that this hotel is providing to me especially in terms of food.

My first concern in terms of going abroad is about food. I usually go on business trips for more than three months staying at one country. Regardless of your nationality, just imagine how hard it would be to have food, which you have never had in your life, and you have to deal with the food more than one month. When you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day, you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time. Besides, India is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes. Furthermore, as being a Korean, cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking, but most dishes in India are with this herb regardless of the type of food; Italian, Japanese Thai or Chinese. However, I find foods at this Collage restaurant at Hyatt Hyderabad is not using those herbs for Western or Asian food, and this is what I like this restaurant the best. Besides, for buffet dinner, majority of the food are daily changed. I personally consider this the most important factor for long-term stay guest just like me.

Therefore, my food life at Collage @Hyatt Hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the <<chef Prashant>>, <<chef Pushkar>>, <<chef Sankhar>> and <<chef Santosh>>, are putting into to cater my taste. In addition, they study Korean food or other Asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me. Sometimes, we even talk about food making and recipes, and they cook some special food as per my special request.

During breakfast and dinnertime, these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the Collage restaurant fit my taste.

I strongly recommend everyone that Collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at Hyderabad. Lastly, through this review, I sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Probal Sen,29 October 2017,4.5,Came here for a team dinner. The restaurant managers Prathmesh and Kamalika organised the dinner brilliantly. The entire staff was very warm in their hospitality and their buffet was top class. We had an absolutely fantastic experience.
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Sushrut Sawant,29 September 2017,5,Great experience. Nice food. Enjoy the ambience. Service 5/5. Mainly the buffet description and menu options is comfortable to all. I liked the venue. Will visit again.

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Pradeep Kalwad,29 September 2017,5,"Amazing food, amazing staff. Loved the buffet spread and the sunday brunch was outstanding, one of the best in the city. A must try guys. Go for it."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Saad Khan,27 September 2017,3,We had dinner at this place last night. The spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that non-vegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet. The food was average as compared to the other Hyatt at Banjara Hills. The only thing I enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving. And also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy. But the service is top notch and the staff always keeps a tap at your table and was eager to serve us which was great.
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Ajay Kumar Y,01 September 2017,3,"Had lunch buffet today, but disappointed :( .

No choice of our food can't be ordered i mean other than mentioned in food menu :( .

Very less food options compared to others which have same brand level.

But ambiance is very good, it's a pleasant, peaceful.
Service is also very good they are very polite."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Suyash Dhandhania,19 August 2017,1,"Was visiting my in laws for the first time. To celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive. And oh boy, did this place disappoint!? Not only did they lack the basic services like serving Papad and water in the beginning, they made blunders like serving Long Island Ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered. We were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room. We had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude, especially by the restaurant manager Parmeshwar from Lucknow. Each order took a long time to come and was served cold. And when I say served, I don't mean served by them. Oh no, the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves. Despite of this, on lack of better judgment, we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad. Needless to say, our night was ruined and to end it all, just when we thought it can't get any worse, they over billed us. We spent 20 mins to get it corrected. The icing on the cake was, the charged us for the Long Island Ice Tea as well üòÇüòÇ.
Please avoid this place at all costs. And you'll be saving a LOT! üòÖ You'll also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they'll refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it.
P. S- If you're a cheese enthusiast, please don't make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did. For ‚Çπ600, they served us stale cheese with few almonds, crackers and 2 apricots. Whoever originally came up with this dish, must have shifted somewhere n his/her grave when these people had the audacity to serve something like this to us."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Jerry,14 August 2017,5,One great place for breakfast ! The buffet spread Is great and the service is impeccable! Loved everything on the menu! Had memorable time here! Happy Eating! :)
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Abdull Ghan,19 July 2017,5,Awesome hotel.. service is state of the art.. really enjoyed my stay here.. I was personally received by Chef Amit patra a wound full chef who made our stay worthwhile.
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Kunal Sanghvi,16 July 2017,3,"Positive:
1. Great place for a team outing. You get your space
2. Nice facilities
3. Buffet had a wide variety from North Indian to Asain to Street food

Negatives:
1. Not much choice for vegetarians
2. Too costly for its quality"
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Raviteja Polavarapu,14 July 2017,2,"For a tram dinner on a Thursday, I listed down few places and finally desided to go to ‚ÄúCollage ‚Äì Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli‚Äù. I very shorty realized that it was a wrong choice.

Except the place, nothing was good. Specially the Menu and the food was not really good.

The items on the buffet were so limited that I hardly had anything to eat. Multi-Cuisines (On the website: Continental, Italian, North Indian, Chinese, Asian, Thai), but in reality only continental and Asian.

That too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the Fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable. Not even a single Indian item was found in the entire menu.

So kindly revise your menu on Zomato."
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Bazid Shariff,03 July 2017,4,"My first stay in Hyatt and it was just awesome..! We had our dinner and breakfast at collage food, ambience was good and best part of Hyatt was their services which made me bowled... from room service to dinning they gave their best

I hope in my next visit can find some barbecues üòú"
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Shivani Mohan,19 June 2017,4,Collage is an absolutely picturesque restaurant set amidst lush green environs of Hyatt Hyderabad Gachi Bowli. It is an all day dining restaurant with an open Italian style kitchen focusing on home style food. We tried the lunch buffet and it offered the best of international cuisine including European and Oriental and a good variety of local Andhra delicacies! The biggest plus point is the location and ambience. Chef is further working on a new menu and look which will be unveiled on 24 June 2017. Look forward to that!
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Rajiv Kurian,16 June 2017,1.5,"Went for Sunday brunch with a lots of expectations about the food & spread. Was going over after a very long gap. Truly disappointed to see the brunch at this level. ‚òπÔ∏è
Very less options of non-veg on the buffet both in Indian & western.
Only a chicken pie, & an oriental chicken dish inside. In the Indian had only Biryani & raara gosht.
The highlight was in place like Hyatt your serving Vada Pav as part of the sunday brunch, come on you must be really kidding me, I am sure you can do better than this. üòÄ
Lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there. ‚òπÔ∏è
Pizza was just like an Indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top.
The place has just got some upgrade only in terms of just some artifacts new linen etc, but the food quality & buffet spread is so so so disappointing. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è

Sad to see Hyatt go down like this!"
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Harsh Baldev (Feed Me & Co.),04 June 2017,4,"#InvitedByRawPressery #BloggerHaul 

So, buffet breakfasts is something I particularly enjoy and the one I had at Collage, Hyatt Hyderabad was quite a decent one at that. 

Hyatt Gachibowli is a beautifully done property and Collage is one of its pretty restaurants. With a variety of options to choose from, the buffet breakfast a quite a steal.

From American favorites like muffins, donuts, waffles and croissants to Indian delicacies like Masala Dosa, Idli and Usal pav, most of the things were delectable. Fresh cut fruits, juices and salads, live omelet counter, tea, coffee, milk, different types of juices, a selection of breads, different types of jams and cheese, well, the list is endless. 

Overall, a lovely relaxed Sunday morning spent, this!

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rajasi,22 May 2019,4,"The food is toooooooooo good. The interior and the ambiance both are very cozy. Only the staffs could have been a little more attentive.
The wash basin and toilet should have been as neat and clean as the restaurant."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Neha Roy,22 May 2019,4,The food is too good. The place is very cosy and will give you a homely vibe. People there just welcome you with a big heart and a broad smile. I‚Äôm in love with this restaurant.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Yogender Pal,19 May 2019,2,Excellent food but the service sucked !! The staff there are just not interested and they act as if they do a favour to you!! I might only go there for the food only !!
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Kate Midelton,13 May 2019,2,"After so many of goody goody excellent reviews I been there n i was very excited to taste the foodz I was missing northeast tasteü§§ but sorry to say it was not upto the mark it was ok chalega type , being a northeast I know wat it should taste"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Syed Faraan Ahmed,05 May 2019,5,"This place has always been polite and friendly, the lady who has been taking care of this place is like a superwoman.. who make sure that no one goes unhappy..no matter how busy this place is that lady always have a happy to serve expression.. i always come to this place on my off days."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debopam Majumder,05 May 2019,5,"The best place in Hyderabad to have Pork and beef together. Amazing taste & quality of meat, a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers, Zing's serves large varieties of non-veg dishes in a pocket-friendly budget. Just a reminder, this is not a place to have vegeterian foods. I have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw/ cooked meat while visiting this restaurant. They are very misleading and misinformative. First of all, you shouldn't be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice. Period.
I tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu. Not once I have been disappointed. Every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating.
The one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs. Due to excessive demand, they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace, hence you'd find many reviews telling how their service is slow, how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up. Personally, i've never experienced such delay.

P.S. They cook amazing Ramyun Noodles."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Kunal Dutta,05 May 2019,5,"Very authentic food, different from what you get elsewhere in Hyderabad. Their dumplings, pork ribs, beef fry, everything was awesome. Great job !"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Soumith,05 May 2019,4,"This place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork. After seeing all those positive reviews in Zomato, I decided to give it a try.
I along with 3 of my friends went on a Friday Eve to this place.

Appetizers :

1. Deojikalbi : This is a pork appetizer, we loved it very much and repeated the order. For the second time, we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious.

2. Pork ribs : I did not enjoy this dish really much. Meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds. I dunno if north-east people love this type of food but it's ok, it was my first time.

3. Pepper chicken : Due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken, we had to order this appetizer. Taste was good , nothing fancy.

Main Course :

1. Ramyun with Pork : we ordered 2 rumyun with pork, taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered.

2. Soba noodles with pork and veggies : This dish tops the list. Luckily, I am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun.
Soba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun. If tasted really delicious. I cannot say how perfect this dish is.

3. Naga-chicken rice : When restaurant staff placed this dish on our table, I saw chicken was undercooked. I asked the same to them, they said this is how north-east people like to eat, a bit chewy. I thought chalo let's try it, but chicken was so chewy that it's taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it.
I was disappointed with this dish.

Overall experience :

Food : 3.5 / 5
Service : 3/5 ( it was too slow)
Ambience : 3.5 / 5 (cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends)

I will definitely recommend this place to everyone. Sometimes we need to surprise our taste buds with some new cuisine üòúüòã and this place has got delicious food too."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Gyan,02 May 2019,4,"The authentic taste of North East Indian delicacies, one will find here with mouthwatering dishes. Good place good location. But the quantity of food per dish served is little smaller."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Bastab Chakraborty,01 May 2019,2,"Couldn't resist posting this review. Has been visiting this place since the time it opened - has been there multiple times. Never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service.

But nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. There can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. If food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. Dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.

As a customer, I would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour. Worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Atei Jenny Uo Chon,26 April 2019,3,Food is not bad but not like northeast. Service are very slow n staff will not response properly. I didn't understand its northeast food or korean food. I ask for northeast food n disappointed.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Raisa Bhatia,23 April 2019,5,"Have been to this place so many times that I‚Äôve lost count. Great food, (especially the beef and pork dishes, although at times some of them seem similar)
Good value for money... be patient for the service. Worth visiting at least once, then give it a chance to win you over"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'",23 April 2019,4,"A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

Drinks:

1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.

I would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

Teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

Beef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

Pork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.

Service: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

Overall fine dining experience:

Ambiance - 4.5/5

Food (worth the money) - 4/5

Service: 3.5/5"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Wei-Ting,20 April 2019,3,"A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening, and while the food lived up to its usual great standards, I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable. I have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times I have been here. Kudos to the team for their effort, nonetheless. I know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Devrath Khara,19 April 2019,2,"Went there after hearing a lot of buzz about this being a go to North Eastern place, but such a bummer!
Ambience : 1star: the place doesn't not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 ACs which seemed to not work. it's connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat. No music. We were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept.
Service: 1 star. The staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.
Not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)
Non veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.
Veg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg Maggi! Very misleading name and price.
Veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Avishek Banerjee,14 April 2019,1,"This place should realise that a dine-in restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting. The place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who don't give a damn about you. You can die asking for something and you won't get it. They don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. The AC does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.

Coming to food. If you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. They open at 11.30. We asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. Finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. Now the taste. The ingredients are very good and fresh. The quality of pork is great. The taste doesn't have much variation. Everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. After a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. If this is how the food of North eastern India is, well, I'll avoid that geography. And I'll surely avoid this eatery. There is no excuse for bad and rude service!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Jay Mehta,13 April 2019,4,"This was on our list of places to eat in Hyderabad for a while, but what kept us not going is the popularity with Meat! I am a vegetarian and wondered what i will get, seeing bibimbap on the menu , i had to try it.

We ordered fried tofu appetiser and bibimbop and freshlime+square.

Drinks were as displayed, tofu was bit disappointing..it was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seeds..can miss this if you plan to go.

Do definitely try the bap! Tasty and filling, great portions of the veggies, rice, sauce...although rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypot..nevertheless tasty!

In the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity, we were like WTF..the sauce was HOT made from naga chillies yet sooo good..burned my tongue but loved every bit of it..so if you have rice remaining give this a try as well.

Staff were courteous as well.

One star less just for the tofu. Rest was perfect

Will definitely visit again"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Saikrishna Pothuri,11 April 2019,4,"It's amazing for the people who eat Beef & Pork. The Lemon Grass Chicken was good too.

I only eat chicken but I have seen that all the dishes were very well cooked and the texture was nice. My friends loved them.

Must visit for the people who like Beef or Pork or North East Food."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Yumm Liza,10 April 2019,3,The food was delicious but the service was hilarious I'm giving 3 star only bcz of the food we have to cll again and again more then 5 times after than finally. They come
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Shilpa Reddy,10 April 2019,5,"Amazing amazing amazing
The best place to have all kind of pork dishes. they are just cooked to perfection, honestly better than the 5 star restaurants in town.
Amazing food for amazing prices.
Super budget friendly

So happie to have found this place for my pork fix.
Added to weekly outing to my schedule."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Piyali Ghosh,06 April 2019,5,"Had heard about this place from a colleague of mine, post which I decided to try it myself. A quaint little place opposite SLN Terminus, this joint serves authentic Tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. We had ordered Minty Cucumber in mocktails, a Korean appetizer Tangsuyuk, Kalbi Bokum, Smoked Pork fried with Bamboo Shoots and Teriyaki Chicken. All the dishes tasted good, the Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet though.
Would love to visit again and try out their other delicacies."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Ryan DSilva,02 April 2019,5,"This place came with high recommendations from a food expert in the industry for the last two decades or so.

Visited Zing‚Äôs Northeast Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. We ordered for :

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Honest food prepared with a lot of passion. Absolute value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Su Bhro Banerjee,15 March 2019,5,One of the best places in and around Hitech City to have good food. Price is very decent and main course portions are also very good . Would surely come back again
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Tanmayee G,13 March 2019,1,"Terrible food, deeply dissatisfied, ramen is just fancy looking maggi(literally) which is totally off. No sticky rice, or special authentic sauces. Very sad to see such low standards of food, NOWHERE NEAR AUTHENTIC PAN ASIAN FOOD."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Isabella P,08 March 2019,5,Delicious food.. Amazing place.. Reminds me of my hometown place.. Would definitely visit again for a scrumptious delicacy of north east.. And lastly would recommend every beef and pork lover.. Thank you zing kitchen was a lovely evening.. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Priyanka Nair,06 March 2019,4,"The place is very cosy and neat, not many big furniture‚Äôs or things, tiny place but spacious. The food is simple and tasty, the presentation of the food is great, the service is good, but I think the communication with the server was a bit of a problem. Overall a good experience."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Lynn Prashanth Stephen,05 March 2019,5,"Every Dish is Wonderful here at Zings. Great quality and taste. Fresh meat served with awesome tasting gravy. Try the Teriyaki Chicken..
The main course as well as the starters in pork and beef dishes are yum, especially their Naga Smoked Curry.."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Naveen Kolluguri,05 March 2019,4,"Friend ordered Chicken Scullent, Non veg Ramyun, chicken sobs and square cut along with Virgin Mojito. The food was very good and the bill came upto 627 which was a very decent deal. Will be visiting place"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Vishesh,04 March 2019,4,"A place with an authentic South East Asian decor.

If you ever happen to be here, certainly try their raymun noodles, a little bland, however, seems authentic.

They also have good chicken drumsticks to offer and the non-alcoholic beer is good to go with the food they serve.

A pocket friendly place for a lazy evening."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Aalekhya Cherukuri,03 March 2019,5,"The kimchi is to die for! The momos, pork and rice are top notch as well! Amazing food, amazing staff and a cozy place to share a meal with your family."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Subhobroto Mukherjee,03 March 2019,1,Service was too slow due to lack of staff. AC was not on hence we were sweating inside as it was conjusted. Had high hopes of having our fav dishes i.e chicken momo & Dotsol bibimbap but none was available and the items which we ordered were undercooked i.e lemongrass chicken & Garlic Prawn
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Bongo Lawlona,27 February 2019,5,"Starters:
üç¥Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
üç¥Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
üçΩÔ∏è Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
üçπSummer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπFresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

THIS IS COMFORT FOOD! SANELY PRICED, IMPECCABLY PORTIONED, HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Divya Iyer,26 February 2019,4,"We wouldn't have found this gem of a place if we hadn't been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch. More than a month since we visited, but it was such a treat! The place is tiny, right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it.

The menu is pretty extensive, but going by our love for pork, we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer. We ordered Soba noodles with pork and veggies, Naga Pork curry (which came with rice) and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots.

The noodles were alright, but had sort of a maggi consistency - but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor. The naga pork curry was a revelation - spicy but so full of flavor, my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit! The fried pork was delicious too, but an overkill, going by how we were already full with the first two dishes. 

We had ordered the flavored beer they have, which was refreshing but relatively overpriced. But just for the food, I think we need to visit again. Highly recommended for the cuisine they have on offer!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Varun P,22 February 2019,5,"This place is definitely worth few visits for any foodie to try different North Eastern and asian cuisine.
The pork belly dishes were really tasty, also appreciate the staff helping us eat the right way.."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Pori Goswami,20 February 2019,4,"This has to be one of my favorite restaurant. It is a tiny, cosy place that serves korean and northeastern food. I am reviewing it for the second time and how much I appreciate this place being a korean food fan in Hyderabad where options are little less in terms of getting Korean/NE cuisine. The owner is super friendly and courteous. The kimbap is good in taste, serves 10 pieces per plate which is worth the money (180bucks) accompanied by wasabi and soya sauce. Just because of kimbap, I can rate this place a 4 happily."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Moxa,17 February 2019,4,"Had visited this place after a friends recommendation and what a experience!! Wee visited in the evening hours so we're not that hungry just wanted a quick bite. Tried their chicken momo and pork ribs.. both of them were extremely delicious and cooked to perfection. We also tried there summer time mocktail but initially it was served under room temperature, after requesting them the add on some ice it tastes fine.
We would loved the place and would visit again soon.
Thankyou :)"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rishi Ravi,17 February 2019,5,"Had an amazing time at zings, beware place was packed all through out. Amazing food and drinks to go with it, the ambience is nice and their food tastes great!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Kiran S,16 February 2019,5,Totally Welcome change from the regular flavours. Wonderful choice of Pork and Beef dishes. Succulent meat dishes. Flavours one can‚Äôt savour in the fanciest of restaurants.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debangana Tarafdar,10 February 2019,4,"Northeast Kitchen, located right beside Pista House, has been a good find for me.

I have been there more times than I can count on my fingertips.

I love the simple ambience, and the food.
I won‚Äôt vouch for consistency though. Service is slow, and really slow on a full night.

My favourite dishes here are the Steaky Pork Ribs, Smoked Pork with Bamboo shoot and Bibimbaap. Momos are decent.
Soup is canned, something, I was a little shocked to find out.
Their mocktails are also very good.

Although there are fallacies, the food still makes me go back again and again."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,10 February 2019,4,"Small but cozy place if you are looking for good north east food or korean food.
The place usually packed but you would definitely find a table. Staff is polite and friendly.
Coming to food.... There is so much on the menu to try on.
Pork ribs are most recommended but they are only available on weekends.
Beef with onions and chilly is good. They come with complimentary rice which is unlike normal indian rice. More like how Koreans eat.
You get non alcoholic beer here, which goes well with the food."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Tanmayi Mohan,08 February 2019,3,"Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that's a part of India, but different from the other usual cuisines, led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing's for dinner.

First up, we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant. The starters were quite good- spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations (pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork).
The main course, however, was disappointing, or perhaps we expected something else. The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them. There was not enough broth either (which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles). The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally.

The best thing would be the prices- everything is so resonably priced, it's not easy to find non-veg (especially pork, beef etc) at these prices!

One major area of feedback would be the service. They have an extremely laidback, dont-really-care attitude, and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time.

A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently- maybe even start a franchise :)

Value for money- 3.5/5
Service- 2.5
Ambience- 3/5
Overall- 3/5"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Narresh Tellakulla,02 February 2019,3,"Been here with friends for lunch, the moment we entered in to the restaurant you will feel as if your in some eastern states. we ordered drumsticks, chicken teriyaki and OM chicken rice. The drumsticks were good with sauce and best part was chicken teriyaki it was delicious and tasty and the OM rice was okay. Overall food was good and service was okay."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Shivi Saxena,30 January 2019,3,"I read a lot of reviews about this place before visiting, most of them read that the service is very slow. I only realised it after I went there.
I was so tired waiting for my food that I only had starters here and went to some other place for dinner.
Food was no wonder very tasty.

We ordered drums of heaven and pork belly in chilly sauce. It all tasted really nice.

I hope the place works on their service."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Teboihi Hrahsel,29 January 2019,5,I have been here many times....The food are really delicious and nice place...Staff are good and friendly as well....but one thing food used to pending and waited for so long...So you have to get more improve deliver food on the table and not letting them wait for so long.....Thank you for give us apportunity to have the good food.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Saran Raparthy,27 January 2019,1,"Had been there today with the reviews seen here. Food was below average. We ordered lemon grass chicken , 2 pork dishes, Naga chicken curry, butter garlic prawns, chicken raymun noodles. Out of all this lemon grass chicken n pork never came to our table. Staff are very very slow very dumb very very poor service. Forgot half of the items even after writing down. Guys just be prepared each dish takes a minimum of 30mins for it to arrive at your table. Never going here again."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Reshma Gupta,27 January 2019,1,"Very late order..he forgot half of the food that I ordered..had to keep reminding...the staffs are not friendly at all.they don't even talk to you straight face,not polite, do not visit"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sarvesh Gupta,26 January 2019,2,"It was a bad experience. Worst part was when we entered the places and there was this pathetic smell to welcome us. Another issue, you can't just order anything from the menu because maximum number of items were not available.

The food was smelling too.

I ordered ""Steam Naga Fish"".

If u really want to eat, get a mask(suggestion)."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rohit Chakraborty,24 January 2019,5,Best restaurant if you are looking for authentic Naga food away from north east I would recommend everyone to try here at least once thanks you guys for bringing this in Zomato too
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Jujit Saikia,23 January 2019,5,"If you live anywhere in Hyderabad and you love eating pork and beef, then this is a good place to try. None of the dishes contains masala. And the chutney given as complimentary with the main course is worth trying though it is very very spicy because of the BHOOT JOLOKIA. Happy feasting:)"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sarthak Bajaj,21 January 2019,3,"The staff is a little less knowledgeable and understanding when it comes to explaining the dishes, they don't have anything for a vegetarian guest ( we had one vegetarian friend in a group of 10 who starved )

They restaurant smells for the raw meat from the kitchen.

The mocktails are good, the pork is mid rare and juicy, however the chicken is not that good."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,An Urag Yonzon,20 January 2019,5,"I had a good experience .
This was my first time in zings northeast kitchen.
The starters were good .
But I was disappointed when I got two of my orders not available.
Next time when I visit I would love to have those starters too .
Lots of love .
Thank you ."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Gopika Padmakumar,20 January 2019,4,"The food was excellent. I took one star off just because the staff behaviour could be improved. If you love North eastern cuisine and southeast asian cuisine, a must try."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Medha Parashar,19 January 2019,3,"First of all they dint have main dish for which i went... Bibimbap and kimbap.. But still i got teteiyaki chicken and noodles. Sweet and simple place with pretty cozy ambience. People who serve food are very friendly but there were only 2 people who were serving food so our order came really late. Place is really famous so people were even waiting outside for seats.
Tip: please call them beforehand if you are specially looking for Bibimbap.."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sumit,17 January 2019,1,"Such a disappointing visit. Went at around 7.30 p.m. Menu was given having lot of options to choose from. Beef, Pork, Chicken, Fish, Veg. I don't eat Pork and Beef so asked for Chicken Momo: NOT AVAILABLE Veg Momo: NOT AVAILABLE Mung Tang (fish item): NOT AVAILABLE Full Steam Fish: NOT AVAILABLE.
I walked out of the place without having anything."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Veggie-Lover,17 January 2019,3,"First things first:
Decent food. Average Service. Affordable pricing. Big on non vegetarian delicacies.

Small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos, bruschetta and Ramen.
Good things take time, especially if it‚Äôs a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food. Be patient. The service is slow but the food is good.

If you‚Äôre looking for a bowl of north Eastern style of Ramen, try their version of it. Simple, soupy and well spiced. It‚Äôs a bowl of comfort. Let‚Äôs not get your hopes high just yet. It‚Äôs their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise.

The momos are good, soft and melt in the mouth- must try. They run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon.


Overall it‚Äôs a small place. Give it time, nurture it. Go for the experience."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Vasudev Singh,17 January 2019,3,"Hard to get hold of their attention. After a number of visits I now have come to terms that, it  usually takes 10-15 mins for them to come tend to you. Heck even a glass of water takes time to come to the table. Service needs to get better ! 

Anyways coming to the food, a great place for most things pork. My favorite dish which is something I totally gorge over is the Bosam. Nicely sliced pieces of pork belly, kimchi and tender pices of chillies. Each bite is a bliss. The kimchi pork fried rice is good too though I wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Duggu,15 January 2019,4,"My 1st visit to the place for lunch and i enjoyed their food.
We ordered lemongrass chicken it was nice but not strong lemon grass flavor though. But the chicken stew with rice was awesome, it was very light yet very flavor full. I will surely visit this place again to try their Korean menu. #foodlove"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,15 January 2019,4,"Having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place, and the 4.5 rating on Zomato, it was on my wishlist for ages, but I was always skeptical of the taste, being too authentic and a totally new cuisine. The former proved to be true, and was the primary reason I didn't have a very pleasing dinner.

It's a small and cute little diner like Cafe, with minimalistic and soothing interiors. The sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially, but I got used to it in just a few minutes. Some room freshener would do the trick.

The items are priced very cheap, I had high expectations, but only to learn later the portions are just too small. We had:

üçó SPICY DRUMS OF HEAVEN (140/5) - The only thing I could properly finish. A typical batter fried chicken. Almost south Indian and spicy in taste, but the coating was too thick.

üçó CHICKEN SUCCULENT YAKITORI (130) - 3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks, spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle. Texture was good, but taste, average. Sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like.

üçó CHICKEN MOMOS (130/5) - Standard, good amount of filling, with a very pungent ginger flavor. The coating was thick too. Chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy, and went well with the Momos.

üêΩ BOSAM (170) - It was my first time trying pork belly, and I can't really judge, but it felt fatty and gooey. The pieces were drenched in grease. Served with spicy kimchi which I loved.

üçú CHICKEN RAMYUM NOODLES (180) - Big bowl of noodles, what looked like Maggi but was only a close resemblance. Scarce chicken pieces, undercooked, dry and hard noodles, and overall a very bland taste.

üêü NAGA STEAM FISH (250) - This was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant. And I couldn't tolerate it. A very very pungent and strong odor. The fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection. Served with steamed white rice.

Whatever I mentioned about the food, was just my impression, and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine, I didn't really like it.

However, one thing that was disappointing was the service. It was slow and just took ages. Once the food arrived, it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes.

As many others have already said, I guess, the strong point of this place is their pork preparations, and I would recommend this place purely for that. An elaborate menu with lots of options, priced well.

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5 (not judging what I tried first time/don't know about)
Ambience - 4/5 (get a room freshener!)
Service - 3/5
VFM - 4/5"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Oindrila Dutta,14 January 2019,1,I would give a negative star if possible for their hygiene and service. We ordered our food at 9:30PM and after an hour's wait they come and say that what we ordered from the menu isn't available. We had to order something else and wait for another 30mins and then to my surprise I found HAIR in the food! So in short it a was a terrible experience.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Anvesh Alluri,08 January 2019,1,"Had a lot of expectations after checking out the positive reviews for Zing's. There was some weird smell when we entered the outlet which was a bummer. We asked for momos which were not available. So we got lemongrass chicken and the portion size was very disappointing and shocking. Drums of heaven was another appetizer that we ordered which was below Average. We then ordered Ramyuen noodles which was tasting and looking very similar to maggi. We also got ohm fried rice which was very bland and tomato ketchup was used for presentation. The waiter who took our order looked disinterested. So, I really don't understand what the hype is about. Thumbs down üëé"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Nachiketnh,06 January 2019,2,"We had a family dinner at Zing‚Äôs with very high expectations considering the ratings. We ordered the following :
Moroccan Eggs - 4/5
Chicken Satay - 2.5/5
Drums of Heaven - 3.5/5

Noodles - 0/5( They were like instant noodles with no tastemaker)
Fried Rice with Omelette - 2/5(Nothing much)
Pork Bimbipop- 3/5 (The only decent thing in the main course.

All in all, it‚Äôs not worth the price. We really wanted to like it but were really disappointed."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sachin Upot,01 January 2019,1,"Had the misfortune of visiting this place on New Years Day. We were given the run around with the table, then it took them 30 mins to take our order only to forget all about it. After an hour of reaching the place we realise the food isn‚Äôt even ready.

Not even an apology. Thoroughly disappointed."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Anurag Tej,01 January 2019,5,The food is amazing. Their service needs to improve a lot. 5 stars for tasty food and elaborate menu. The staff was very friendly and can help you with ordering the right dish.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Darshan M Ambat,29 December 2018,5,"The most amazing Naga beef I've ever had. The pork ribs are to die for. The pork belly melted in our mouth. Most of the dishes are tasty as hell.
Portion is kinda small but the price is correct for the portions.
Service is a bit slow. One area they really need to improve is to get more and/or better trained staff.
But the flavor of the food makes up for everything making me give 5 stars."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Deepa Mallick,26 December 2018,4,Love for asian food brought me to this place. This place would accomodate 30 -35 people at once approximately. Food are well made with almost authentic taste. Tried Pork Momos which tasted really good specially the pickle that goes well with momos and you would not find it anywhere else in Hyderabad as per my knowledge. After that we ordered Dotsol Bibimbap which was a colorful food which would please your eyes and ofkorse your savory mouth and fill your stomach for sure (depends how much you eat :P I was full with one bowl) . One more dish that we had ordered was Ramyun Noodle which I felt almost like maggie with a very slight difference but it was soothing and filling. Only thing that had disaapointed me was the late service. We almost had to wait for 40 mins for our food.
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sourav Ghosh,26 December 2018,5,"This tiny joint serves excellent Northeastern & East Asian food. Their Beef Curry with Naga Peppers is heavenly. Deojikalbi was excellent as well. The Beef Soba Noddles was also good, though less so than the other two items. The portion sizes are a little small, but then again the prices are pretty damn cheap as well. The one area where they can improve is the speed & efficiency of service, but since it's fairly new & has a very small staff at this point (possibly family run ?), I'm optimistic that they will improve as they mature."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Foodie Chaudhary,25 December 2018,2,"I seriously didn't understand the buzz around this place. Decided to have Sunday lunch here owing to the good rating of this place. The staff didn't really give any attention and we had to find a table for ourselves.
Many items on the menu were not available even on weekend and we settled for veg clear soup, mushroom & spinach soup to start with. The quantity of soups was a bummer and it was a huge bowl quarter filled with soup. If they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to smaller bowls to atleast give illusion of a filled bowl. Mushroom & spinach soup tasted like Maggi /Knorr soup and not fresh.
For starters we opted butter pepper garlic prawn. It was served in a small plate with even smaller portion. 5 tiny prawns for starter definitely doesn't justify. The taste was average , better than soup.
For main course we decided Dotsol Bibimbap and Naga Chicken curry. Main course was way better in taste and we really liked Bibimbap. Naga chicken was good in taste but had mostly bones.
The portion size is major disappointment here and its evident across all courses. Another point of concern is their service. Be it taking order, suggesting food or even table service, the staff is not really helpful and takes forever to respond."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debdatta Podder,22 December 2018,2,Visited this place with much expectations..but got disappointed with the service and the bad smell inside the restaurant..we ordered chicken momo and lemongrass chicken..chicken momo was very okayish...n after waiting for a long time the owner informed that they need lot more time to make the dish..as we couldn't wait more did not get chance to taste the dish...service needs to be improved..
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debajyoti Das,22 December 2018,5,"Food is awesome and loved the chicken momo and the chicken noodles. Good authentic food, a must visit for any momo and noodle love. However expect a delay in service."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Eeha Ashok,22 December 2018,4,"One of the very few places that I tried North eastern food. The place has a cosy setup with interiors and cutlery that totally go with the theme of the place.

We ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl, Ramyan noodles, bruschetta and Doenjang Jjigae. We absolutely loved the Jjigae, which is similar to a vegetable stew and absolutely rich with flavours. The teriyaki bowl and noodles were definitely above average. They served the teriyaki bowl with saut√©ed spinach on the sides, perhaps more vegetables would have been better. All in all a great experience!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Syed Zeeshan,15 December 2018,1,"Bad experience when ordered food from here. Prices looked very reasonable while ordering, and literally the quantity was very less. They should be mentioning that if we are ordering Prawns for starters they are giving exactly 6 pieces of them. Very disappointed with that even though the taste is good."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rupayan Banerjee,11 December 2018,3,"I was pretty excited looking at the 4.6 rating. But quite disappointed. I would rate the food at 4 though. But service is extremely poor. The staff isn't good at recommending dishes. The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn't good, probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste. The pork belly was good. Beef fry wasn't great because meat was undercooked. The steam country chicken curry was good.

I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sahiti B,11 December 2018,5,"Cute little place with GREAT food and superb presentation. The interiors are simple and pleasant. The place is very neatly maintained and appears hygienic.
This place is just walkable from my office and it has been my go to place since the time I discovered it.
I love their Garlic Prawns, Chicken Yakitori, Teriyaki chicken, and noodles."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Thomas Premkumar,09 December 2018,1,very low quantity for the price
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Somnath,08 December 2018,3,"Hello Guys, This will be honest review. We visited yesterday(7th Dec) as we heard a lot about this restaurant. We had a mixed experience here. When you enter this place, you will definitely feel a bad smell inside. That was really disgusting. We ordered Chicken lollipop, Smoked Pork, Bosam and Ramyun Noodles. Food was awesome except Bosam. We didn't like the taste. So If you want to try Northeast food, surely you can give a try."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sathishchowdary Ng,07 December 2018,4,"Perfect northeast kitchen in the town...
The pork rice is delicious and noodles are good...don't expect a regular noodles...the non alcoholic beers are good
And fries are very good"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Manisha Singh,05 December 2018,5,"This is my go to place. I can never get bored of their food and ambience. Happy to see them in Zomato. Food is always great. Love the ramyun noodles and bibimbap. Best time to visit is on weekdays. On weekends, there's too much rush and food orders get delayed. I would suggest to add more items in their menu."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Samrat Basani,04 December 2018,5,"Been here twice in less than a month, and I hope I can keep coming back.

I absolutely love their food. The bibimbap is to die for, and the king chilly pork only slightly less so. Their ice-cream also manages to be excellent.

The service is a bit shifty, but we can't have everything. Unbelievable prices (for now), as well. Definitely go here if you love meat.

Slightly louder music and tea would be great additions, but hardly necessary."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Food Hunters,04 December 2018,5,"This amazing restaurant is not exactly in Gachibowli. It's located between Sarath City Capital and SLN Terminus Mall in Kondapur.

We visited this place when it had just opened and we were surprised with the quality of the food. For starters, we had pork momos. Everything including the presentation was perfect. Beef Soba Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken Rice alongwith Roasted Chilly Lamb and each one was competing with the other for a place in our hearts. The beef had a lovely texture and was well cooked. It was a tad on the bland side but tasted great nevertheless.

The ambience catches your eye and one fails to control the urge to click pictures of the walls. The people are nice, so is the food. You could keep visiting it."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Jennie Clarence,03 December 2018,3,"We were soo excited about the place but somehow not satisfied.. Firstly.. The place was in utter silence.. The ramyun noodles, bosam, butter garlic prawns were all just mediocre and purely serves just 1.. Lack of Salt was felt in some dishes.. Yea but the mock tails were good.."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Harika Reddy,01 December 2018,5,"Finally some korean dishes in a restaurent in the city...!! Have tried their
-Bossum(korean lettuce wraps)
-Dwaenjang jigae(soyabean paste gravy with vegetables)
-kalkuksu(plain noodles with chicken)
-Daeji kalbi(porkbelly with ganjang sauce)
-Steam fish naga chili
Everything was soo good...loved the soyabean paste gravy and ssam was pretty good too.Kalkuksu needs more broth to it...it was very dry with little broth...wish they didn't use instant ramen.The serving pots gives life to this place...am visiting this one again for sure.My love for asian and authentic cuisines made me visit this one and it didn't disappoint."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sai Kiran Bolloju,01 December 2018,1,"Forget the 4 or 5 rating given for this restaurant. This place is crap. I will say except plating, nothing will please your appetite. Customer service, I will give -10. For 15 tables, it a single guy who was taking orders. In between all this, he is also the one who is at bill desk too. Believe me they didn't served water until we are forced to ask for.

Customer service - they don't deserve a rating for it.
Food - 1*"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Heavenly Nan,29 November 2018,4,"The restaurant is a nice decent place and pocket friendly too. Food taste good but I personally think there are too much soya sauce mostly in everything .The menu is mainly Korean with very few NE food in their main course section(for people who really want to experience northeastern food I‚Äôd suggest that the main course section might be helpful for you). Over all, m happy that I found a place to hop in whenever I feel like having pork or beef."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Arun.geetesh,26 November 2018,4,"It's a fairly simple restaurant, nothing too fancy, with some parking available right in front of restaurant. However the climb is way too steep. Has pork and beef on menu, a great addition to Kondapur. Food is good, portions are small, but that's by Hyderabad standards, otherwise one dish is enough for one adult. We went on a Sunday and we had to wait for close to one hour to get all items ordered, maybe we will try it on a weekday, if waiting time still is that long, it needs serious improvement. Overall a new addition for niche crowd."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Abhishek Sarkar,25 November 2018,4,"Best pocket friendly place in and around Gachibowli if you are a fan of South Korea, and North Eastern cuisine. And, yes there's a lot of love in cooking Korean food and every morsel tastes wonderful. Small place, good range of menu and pocket friendly price. Must try - Smoked Pork Ribs, Pork Bosam , Naga Steamed Fish and Chicken Ramyun Noodles."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Banisree Basu,24 November 2018,5,"I have been waiting to write a review for Zing's north east kitchen for a real long time and I love what they cook n create, it's a little restaurant on the very opposite side of SLN terminus, Gachibowli. The food quality is amazing just feels like home, quantity and the price are reasonable. And I have lost count of the number of visits I made... Strong recommendation for pork and beef lovers üòç"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sohini Ganguly,22 November 2018,5,"For All the Pork lovers now you have an amazing outlet right at Gachibowli....great food , very good staff ...personal care from the owner ...just loved it ...."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sourav Datta,15 November 2018,4,"An awesome foodie experience that takes you telepathically to the kitchens of North East India. Will come here again and again for the taste of their food if not for anything else.

Food: 4/5 The pork dishes are awesome and the noodles were delicious. This is one place where though your stomach is full your heart wants more. Only thing I do not like is the noodle that they use. Feels like instant noddles and I feel this could be better.

Service: 3/5 Service is very slow. They seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes (which is more often than not) when they are busy Service can be very slow. They have to very soon hire some more helping hand if they continue to experience this much of demand.

Ambiance :  3.5/5 Simple and minimalist interiors of a north eastern roadside joint.

Price : 4/5 Pretty decently priced for the quality and taste that they offer. It is really a steal deal."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debasmita Ghosh,15 November 2018,4,"An extremely accessible joint situated on the main road with a pretty good variety of north east cuisine and a polite bunch of staff. We planned to try anything but options in pork so we ordered pork belly with veggies n kimchi salad. The particular dish is supposed to be consumed is a unique fashion. The pork belly, veggies and kimchi are to be placed on the lettuce leaf and wrapped. This combination is delicious and you would love it. Next we had smoked pork ribs which i assume had barbecue sauce and sesame seeds and tastes pretty soft tender and yum. The beef curry and steamed rice was decent but extremely spicy. You can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dishes.
Ambience is nothing but ordinary and it draws a decent crowd even on weekdays.
But i would definitely go back to try the other delicacies. Do visit and indulge into their menu."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Kunal Khanra,14 November 2018,5,"I have been looking for good porks in Hyderabad.. n finally found it . Pocket friendly and delicious food you would find over here. Right opposite to SLN terminus, quick service, decent interior and courteous manner! Pork ribs, beef curry chicken momo..the list goes on! Don't miss this place .."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Lisa Saikia,14 November 2018,5,"I visited this place once and oh my oh my lemme tell you, this place is ahmaaazing! The food was amazing. We ordered pork and it tasted so good, just melted in my mouth. I am salivating just by thinking about it. Maybe there was just a little extra soy sauce in the food but however it was, it was really good! Highly recommended! Will visit soon. Chompchompchomp!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Arpit Sahai,13 November 2018,5,"Though understaffed, this place is really a treat for someone who is not used to North Eastern food. I took few of my friends for a treat and ordered multiple items out of which pork ribs and teriyaki chicken turned out to be amazing. Keep up the good work!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Ritoban Bhattacharya,13 November 2018,5,"If u wanna try good pork in Hyderabad then this is the place, love the pork dishes from starters to main course. Staffs are well behaved & food is not expensive as well. A must visit for pork loversüëç"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Jersha Grace,11 November 2018,5,The food is amazing! Easily one of the best pork dishes I have had in Hyderabad. The restaurant set up is like a cozy little shack and this along with the food transports you to another place entirely. I'm gonna become a regular here!!!
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Aparajita Chowdhury,11 November 2018,2,"We went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while.

Starting of with the pros, the decor and ambiance of this place is really good. The menu is quite interesting too, and includes a variety of chicken, pork, beef and some fish dishes. There are a few vegetarian options, but I do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian. They have a good choice of mocktails as well, and each one was really good. The pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too. The staff there was good too.

Moving on to why I chose to give this a bad review- first of all, the service was really slow. Took about an hour for my food to arrive. Moreover, my chicken noodles tasted exactly like Maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in. I had attached a picture of it for reference. Moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes. A small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people. Even though the taste was good, because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined.
Hence the two stars."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,SUPRIYO DEBNATH,11 November 2018,2,"So yeah, let's start the reviewing part.
1. Costly place and not much appreciated for students.
2. Service is really very slow.
3. Quantity is not much appreciated but kinda okay but not all dishes.
4. They had less staff.

So done with the negative part and the positive thing is that you get to have pork there which is rare in this area and the food is not that great but kinda okay. If you wanna try something new and also spend some extra bucks then go for it. Not much of a satisfactory feeling here. 2 stars for the delays and less quantity of food in fat ass price. Happy dining."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Pratik Kundu,10 November 2018,1,"Sad experience at Zing's after hearing so raving reviews about this place. Folks at the restaurant were least bothered in taking our order right since we sat down on an empty table. Half of the food items on the menu weren't available, maybe they need to shorten the menu just to include items that are available round the clock. We had ordered pork with bamboo shoot, which I have had quite a lot of time at my hometown (Siliguri), unfortunately, this wasn't nearly as good as I had before. Although I won't judge the restaurant based on just this item, as chances are it was a one off case. But the service and staff attitude was a real put off. I had very high hopes, but was completely let down. Something seemed to be very off, as a restaurant having 4.6 rating usually won't come across this way. Either my bad day, or the chef's."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Srinjoy Roy,10 November 2018,5,"It's authentic!
It's delicious!
It's a must visit!
I visited the place two times and it seems to get better every time. The food is very good and the staff is extremely polite and friendly!!"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Ramona Sinha,10 November 2018,4,"This is a small joint for those who love north eastern food. It's just opposite to SLN terminus. I usually have chicken momos from this place as i love it. But this time i also ordered chicken teriyaki bowl. The quantity was a little less and taste-wise it was okayish. The ambience of this place is quite good but the service is a bit slow. I will be trying out other food items as well and accordingly I will update my review. Overall, i liked the place."
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Diandeh Nath,08 November 2018,5,"Tried smoked pork with bamboo shoot and ghost chilly and chicken momos. A perfect blend of everything.
Best chicken momos in all of Hyderabad .

Affordable price and great food"
Dunkin' Donuts,Nithin Jacob Thomas,03 May 2019,2,"The taste and quality of the food here is on a slippery slope. I used to love the Boston creme donut. What once used to have a juicy, creamy filling is now a miser's dab. Burgers have also lost their taste and are mostly insincere."
Dunkin' Donuts,Kbnsindhura,20 April 2019,1,"I have eaten at this place a couple of times before and the donuts were decent. But today, we picked a few donuts to take home and when we tasted them, they felt so stale and tasteless, as if they have been made at least 3 days ago. This was definitely not expected from them"
Dunkin' Donuts,Manab Agarwal,17 April 2019,1,"The donuts were not fresh, it was pathetic in taste, worst donuts ever eaten. I ordered three donuts in which two was completely uneatable and the third one was also stale and had a bad smell(The smell was like a chemical added)"
Dunkin' Donuts,Wajiha Kaukab,01 April 2019,3,Stopped here to have a Americano and a Boston cream donut. The coffee was good but the donut üç© did have less or no filling at all. I‚Äôm not sure if all these places have the same procedures for hygiene coz I bit into something I did not want at all. The staff did apologise but it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience. The place did not look like it was taken care I expected dunkin had the same standards thru out the world.
Dunkin' Donuts,Raghu Amaraneni,30 March 2019,1,"We have ordered dunkins but it was not fresh and no taste

please don‚Äôt prefer this outlet

It was not baked properly and taste was not good.."
Dunkin' Donuts,Varma,06 March 2019,4,"This places always serve one the soft and tasty donuts the verities are very good to look and to taste

They do server other menu items a part from donuts but this is mainly a donut place so expect much from the taste of the other menu"
Dunkin' Donuts,Neha Rathi,21 February 2019,1,Bad service.. staff doesn't know english doesn't know about their work.. donuts are bad... Place is also not clean.. I wish Hyderabad opens M.O.D. soon... Not recommended at all...
Dunkin' Donuts,Harry,01 February 2019,1,I ordered 3 donuts online and all of them were hard and not fresh. And not edible to eat at all. I have no option but to throw them in the dust bin. Very very disappointed.
Dunkin' Donuts,Kittu,31 January 2019,5,"I love burgers and donuts here
Specially eclair donut and big joy veg burger üòç
Staff here really very good
Choclate milk shake and fruit berry smoothy are best drinks in cold

Can u plzz deliver upto gulmohar colony ?
If u extend ur delivery places..Dunkin will really get much appreciations"
Dunkin' Donuts,Vishrut Srivastava,25 January 2019,3,"Dunkin Donuts has always been a great donut place according to me. They serve excellent coffee and burgers as well. I particularly love the Naughty Lucy burger, which is an all time favourite.
This time I decided to try their new Grilled Chicken Monster Burger and I was a little disappointed. As a whole, the burger tasted fine but, why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns? Such a bummer. üòê
However, the donut did uplift my mood in the end, brining the final rating to 3.5. Man does that 'Death by Chocolate' slay me everytime (pun intended üòÇ)."
Dunkin' Donuts,Dileep Vundavalli,12 January 2019,1,"I been to this place on a Saturday morning to have a üç©, I was really disappointed with the service, in the first place the air conditioning was not working, I still compromised to have the donuts, after having the donuts the staff was not able to give me the bill saying that billing machine is not working, I had to pay the parking fee for my car, since I was not having the bill.
I had a bad experience"
Dunkin' Donuts,Vivek Jain,04 January 2019,2,"Located in SLN Terminus on the ground floor, this joint has a good seating and decent ambience.

The place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food. A donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times, but initially they refused to serve one.

Finally the donut I had was the Caramel Vanilla, the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it. The donut anyways turned out to be a good one, perfectly sweet and hot. The caramel however was not upto the mark.

For the drink I had Vanilla Macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. It lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. So there was no vanilla in my coffee.

I would suggest skip this place and head somewhere else for the sweet cravings post dinner."
Dunkin' Donuts,Anirban Saha,03 January 2019,5,"Loved the ambience of the place. Also we ordered a box of six classics, and all of them were delicious. Alongwith the popular chocolate ones do try the caramel, strawberry and colour pop ones too. Also do try Hot Chocolate Orange and Hot Chocolate HazelNut, definitely a must try place for me."
Dunkin' Donuts,Kanthi Voonna,02 January 2019,2,Ordering donuts from this place is a nightmare. They always forget to heat the donuts even after insisting. We have to call the executive and tell the same just to make sure.
Dunkin' Donuts,Aarsh Singh,29 December 2018,4,"Very tasty donuts üòç loved the packaging and also the flavour s were different from each other, the donuts were soft and nice :) everyone would love to come back and have them"
Dunkin' Donuts,Mounika Panthala,28 December 2018,4,"The donuts were fresh and tasty. However these donuts were little small in size compared to donuts served in other outlets. The ambience was good but needs a little maintenance like the tables were not clean and there were flies around.
Overall it was good."
Dunkin' Donuts,Arjun,25 December 2018,3,"I just came out of this outlet. The food is as per DD standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance.

The tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it. The wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes.

For payment too when I decided to pay through the mobile wallet, instead of the standard QR code or getting a request for the OTP, I was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn't working."
Dunkin' Donuts,Tinni Ghosh,02 December 2018,3,Just 5 mins from my house and been there hardly a few times because I did not quite soulfully enjoyed their donuts. The 'ugh' quotient is missing in the do-ugh-nuts here which makes me do-not do the Dunkin Donuts.
Dunkin' Donuts,Abhishek And Moumita Ghosh,21 November 2018,4,Bit Costly..but taste wise its good...almost the taste of usa...good variety of items to choose from. Good place to visit. Ambiance is good also
Dunkin' Donuts,Sai Datta M,07 November 2018,5,"Though the brand's famous for donuts, I'd have to start the review with their Burger. After having got bored with McD, KFC and other popular burger places, DD's burgers are just stunning. Also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  The chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. Unfortunately, it is overpriced!

Coming to their staple food, they are great as well. They got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. But, I would highly suggest having their Death by Chocolate.

And, their packaging is great. I loved the boxes they provided!"
Dunkin' Donuts,TheUtkarsh91,07 November 2018,1,"Had ordered a pack of 6 donuts(mango craze, very very strawberry,Boston creme, eclairs*2 and a rainbow pop). All I got were chocolate donuts!! Never ordering from here again!"
Dunkin' Donuts,Fit Foodie,27 October 2018,4,"Food - 5
VFM - 3.5
Packing - 3.5
Service 3.5

Have been to this place multiple times. This is located at the bottom floor of SLN Terminal Mall. Ordered Heaven Can Wait Chicken burger, Double Big Joy and Big Joy Veg burgers.
Heaven Can Wait was awesome with two chicken patties of pepper and spicy flavors, along with lettuce, cheese and jalape√±o sauce. Packing for delivery can be improved though.
The big joy buggers were fine but lacking in sauces."
Dunkin' Donuts,Sumeetha Thahira Salim,09 October 2018,1,"Very disappointed with this outlet. Ordered four donuts, all four were not at all fresh. The crust had solidified and donut bun lacking any moisture. I am not ordering from here ever again."
Dunkin' Donuts,Sidhartha Burman,30 September 2018,2,"The air conditioning was not working. Half of the items in the menu are not available. The staff is limited and took more than 10 mins to take the order.

My first experience was a memorable one but not for good reasons"
Dunkin' Donuts,Avijnath G,30 September 2018,1,"Donuts were okay.
Milkshakes and thick coffee was horrible.
AC want working and tables were very dirty.
Wouldn't recommend anyone to visit.."
Dunkin' Donuts,Nisha Bachhawat,30 September 2018,3,"It was quite late in the night when we reached here. Had opted for Veg burger, french fries and fruit berry smoothie. The service was prompt and the food was good."
Dunkin' Donuts,Suraj Ram,22 September 2018,3,"To satisfy my donut craving stopped at this place. Ordered some donuts and hazelnut iced coffee, I'd give a 5 for the donuts as they were delicious but the hazelnut iced coffee was bad, it was very diluted and tasted almost like flavored water.
I love their donuts but drinks should be made properly too, please look towards it."
Dunkin' Donuts,Sandipbhure,22 September 2018,2,This place is severely understaffed. Very hot in the afternoon. AC does not work properly. Tables not cleaned unless asked. Donuts are tasty though. Will not visit this place again.
Dunkin' Donuts,Adheeth Hundi,17 September 2018,4,"Have been there couple of times.
1. Great ambience and a nice place to hangout with friends. Spacious and well arranged.
2. Staff are well managed and kind.
3. I had caramel and chocolate donuts, veg burger. Taste was awesome

Overall a nice place to spend time with friends over a coffee and a donut."
Dunkin' Donuts,AJ,16 September 2018,1,"No burgers! Oven is broken, no AC. Why are you open? We usually get takeaway burgers, and this is unbelievable. Very Poor management. I wish they will improve there service because the location is excellent."
Dunkin' Donuts,Karishma Bhatt,14 September 2018,2,"Ordered online from ola cravings . Donuts were not fresh. I ordered twice . First time the donut was good but Second time i got some stone in the donut which completly spoiled my taste.
Food - 2/5
Delivery - 5/5"
Dunkin' Donuts,Kunal Khanra,01 September 2018,5,The picture says everything! How delicious they were! Best donuts in town for sure! Little cosy place for chitchat! Pocket friendly! Good service and nice location! Will try something else next time..
Dunkin' Donuts,Dinesh Baburaj,28 August 2018,1,"I made online order for ""Pack of 6 All time favorite"" donuts. The donuts were not fresh. Waste of money! What is the point in having fancy packaging with bad quality food."
Dunkin' Donuts,Trishna M,22 August 2018,3,"Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:

Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5

Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:

Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.

Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries."
Dunkin' Donuts,Gopalakrishnan Krishnanand,04 August 2018,4,"Had naughty Lucy veg burger meal, alive by chocolate, lychee litchi donuts and filter coffee dunkin style.
The burger was cheesy and tasted good. The donuts were excellent , especially the center lychee filling in the lychee litchi donut. The coffee had a hint of caramel and is worth a try. In all would have rated it at 3.5 as AC was not functional, but will go with 4 for donuts."
Dunkin' Donuts,Produtoori Ankith,31 July 2018,1,"As soon as I opened the box I was so excited to eat them, the presentation was wonderful but when I had a bite the doughnut was not fresh at all, same with every doughnut in the box, dissappointed such a waste of precious money on not at all fresh food üëé"
Dunkin' Donuts,Gourmet Hunter,22 July 2018,4,"Nice store outlet of Dunkin Donuts. We ordered the pack-of-6 flavours and liked all of them.  Buns are freshly baked and flavors are refreshing.
Overall its a nice place to dine once-in-a-while to satisfy your sweet-tooth pangs"
Dunkin' Donuts,Avani Reddy Alla,22 July 2018,2,No complaints regarding the taste or the quality. Their timings are terrible. They don't serve before 11 even though the opening time is 10.
Dunkin' Donuts,Tummy Monster,06 July 2018,5,Searching for that moist fluffiness and crisp crust that makes you love a donut..then this is the place. Especially if you are fan of chocolate.. then break up party eclair is a must to try
Dunkin' Donuts,Shankar Kb,10 June 2018,1,"You should close the store. I had worst experience, I was served a stinking Chicken burger and had to return the same. Even though they served a new one it was still having the foul smell. The food served is stale here."
Dunkin' Donuts,Piyush Kumar,09 June 2018,4,"Ambience - 4/5
Very good place to sit and enjoy with friends
Food - 4/5
Really mouth watering Donuts. Other food and baverages like burgers, coffee are good to have other than donuts Service - 4/5
Really quick service don't make you wait alot"
Dunkin' Donuts,Rahul Singhal,31 May 2018,1,Total wastage of money. It just bread and creamy flavour on top of it. It's not even a bagel. What I got was plain bread with creamy flavoured on it. This is the first and last I'm ordering from here
Dunkin' Donuts,Chef Gastronaut,26 May 2018,4,Well it is as good as it gets. I personally love sugar glaze classic and honestly it was perfect for me. I wish they had blueberry jelly donuts as well.
Dunkin' Donuts,Anil Kumar Ippili,25 May 2018,5,good
Dunkin' Donuts,Amrutha Vani,25 May 2018,4,good
Dunkin' Donuts,Rohan Sahay,21 May 2018,4,Better timings
Dunkin' Donuts,Lakshay Kaura,19 May 2018,3,not all the donors are fresh. I got a donut which is hard as a rock.
Dunkin' Donuts,Kamal Prakash,11 May 2018,3,"The ambience was fine, the chairs were cozy. I liked the bengaluru start up coffee. Death by chocolate donut tasted like chocolate cake and rainbow pop has the right amount of frosting, and the donut itself was very soft. Potato wedges were horrible, the pieces were very big and two of them were not cooked properly!!!!"
Dunkin' Donuts,Kiran Ramoju,06 May 2018,5,good taste.loved it
Dunkin' Donuts,Anurag Dhingra,02 May 2018,5,"Donuts were fresh & yummy
Love the ambience and variety of donuts they have !!!!!
Staff was friendly and smiling üòä
Best breakfast place in town !!"
Dunkin' Donuts,Food Hunters,01 May 2018,4,"The yellow, mango one was the best of the lot (Best I have ever had). The variety of chocolate flavoured ones added to the sheen. Full marks for the packaging. The eclair could be improved with a tad more chocolate inside. Also, if the box contained descriptions of each donut, it'd be easier to figure out which one's which. Swathi Muthu"
Dunkin' Donuts,Ramya Ponnada,01 May 2018,5,"Was never ever a fan of donuts, untill I tasted at this place. Each donut in the box of 6 is simply outstanding. Ambience is great. Value for money is good too. Having tasted donuts at few other places, undoubtedly this is better of all. A must visit place for anyone who loves donuts."
Dunkin' Donuts,Priyanka Yadav,15 April 2018,4,Favourite cafe for finger food as they have a variety of donuts and burgers... surprisingly their burgers are better than their donuts..I have tried almost all the donuts and they never disappointed me and so goes with the burgers... veg mayo is the best as it‚Äôs different than routine burgers with a twist of mint mayo in it... cool place to hangout with friends...
Dunkin' Donuts,Pritimansarkar,14 April 2018,4,Dunkin was supremely professional both at restaurant and served through zomato. The quality of doughnut and hazelnut coffee was quite good and worth a try. Pls note the manager at the SLN terminus was so customer centric that he turned up to deliver to ensure customer satisfaction !! Kudos to them ..
Dunkin' Donuts,Agnimitra Chakraborty,11 April 2018,3,"I went out for evening snacks. The place wasn't clean as it should be as tables were untidy even the floor.

I have ordered for a box of 6 assorted delight donuts and one signature burger. Both the donut as well as the burger was fabulous in taste. But, they were out of stocks for most of the thing.

The service was good and on time.

Ambience: 2/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5"
Dunkin' Donuts,Snehal Mahajan,07 April 2018,1,"no stars for these Dunkin outlet.
was craving to have dounuts.. went with a happy face and came out with huge disappointment. huge chaos with h service . filthy .. table unclear for half hr. had to wait for 3 dounut for half hr. which were ready on display. burger was cold and potato wedges Wer half cooked. asked to warm up dounut, but the they were cold too. service girl was seen carring doughnuts in hand and not tray to service table. loud ringtone was playing on speaker. reluctantly carried dounuts, came out sat outside in clean place and ate it .. üòí"
Dunkin' Donuts,Gopavaram Lokesh,06 April 2018,5,lovely food
Dunkin' Donuts,Indranil Mukherjee,05 April 2018,4,"I want to take a moment & praise the Bangalore Start-up Coffee as much as possible. It is undoubtedly the best Coffee I have ever had.
Donuts are too good.
Place is nice with cozy sitting arrangements.
Just that for cool drinks mainly lemonade, crushed ice consume 60% of the cup.
Rest all good. Nice experience."
Dunkin' Donuts,Pushpa Gorapalli,02 April 2018,2,Not even a cover they have given to hold the box but the package cost charged for 25rs that too in rain.
Dunkin' Donuts,Puja Das,01 April 2018,4,"I always stop by while shopping to a have a quick bite of yummy delicious donuts üç©. I have almost tried all of them. But the donuts which are my favourite are Very very blueberry, Boston Creme & mango dazzle.

I always search for very very blueberry, but it is hardly available now.‚òπÔ∏è"
Dunkin' Donuts,Vaishnavi Pamulapati,30 March 2018,1,The food's horrible.  The service is slow and impolite.  The potato wedges are stale and almost uncooked.  The chicken burger smelled awful. I expected better service from Dunkin' Donuts.
Dunkin' Donuts,Rajesh Keerthi,28 March 2018,4,Good
Dunkin' Donuts,Anushka Bose /Onooshka,27 March 2018,4.5,"I've always loved Dunkin donuts.
We stopped by for a quick grab. Ordered for a combo. Cappuccino, cold coffee, iced tea , potato wedges with dip and 2 varieties of jelly filled donuts.

Dunkin' Donuts,SpYl,10 March 2018,4,Love the donuts. Fresh. Well baked and just yummm. Great variety. Have not got bored with ordering the same flavors again and again and again
Dunkin' Donuts,Prachita Jayaswal,07 March 2018,4,The doughnuts are soft and guey. It melts in your mouth. Caramel doughnut and Belgian chocolate doughnuts are really good. Chicken burger and potato wedges are also good.
Dunkin' Donuts,Shravya Gunipudi,02 February 2018,5,"I love the donuts here and have possibly tasted nearly every flavour. My absolute favourite is the cinnamon because it has the perfect level of sweetness I prefer.

The stuffed donuts are a must try!

You'll surely become a donut lover if you visit this place once. Do give it a try."
Dunkin' Donuts,Rajesh Badiganti,30 January 2018,1,"delivery service is at its worst., food is üëå"
Dunkin' Donuts,Ketaki Agharkar,16 January 2018,3.5,"Some bad donuts and some surprisingly good burgers! That pretty much sums up my experience with Dunkin Donuts. If you are bored of the usuals like McDonald‚Äôs and Burger King, do try the burgers at Dunkin Donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass; they are dry and the toppings too sweet. I always remember the burgers from Dunkin Donuts as crisp, tasty and juicy and that‚Äôs exactly how the Big Joy Veg Burger was when I tried it last weekend. Truly a Big Joy!"
Dunkin' Donuts,Ajay,08 January 2018,4,"2018 is the first time I had chance to eat donuts, interesting desert to eat with good amount of chocolate.

We also had burger and hot chocolate.

Burger was good and beverage was perfectly sippable.

Dunkin' Donuts,Aditya Verma,24 December 2017,4.5,Nice place to have donuts. Been here multiple times and left this place with a smile as the environment is healthy and staff is nice to you. And of course the food is great.
Dunkin' Donuts,Swapnil T,10 December 2017,3,"Well what can I say about this place.. it‚Äôs nice for killing time but, if u plan to have good food it‚Äôs. big no. Donuts are good, but the service here is pathetic. A better service and good coffee would make me go back. Till then it‚Äôs off the list."
Dunkin' Donuts,Rohit Reddy,07 December 2017,3.5,"Been to this place a few times before. Known for its donuts also serves burgers, smoothies, coffee etc., Had the big joy chicken burger (newly introduced) today along with iced coffee. The burger was pretty decent, not so great I would say. The iced coffee should have been more properly blended.
My favourites at Dunkin are
Burger - Naughty Lucy chicken burger ( 4/5 and for people who love cheese it is 4.5/5 )
Donut - Alive by chocolate (4.5/5)
Finally I would say the ambience is good - 4/5 ( Nice hangout place near gachibowli )
Food is decent with an exception for donuts (they are very good). So on the whole I would say 3.5/5
Service - 4/5"
Dunkin' Donuts,Malay Pande,05 December 2017,4,"Had a box of 3 donuts post lunch at sln terminus ..would rate the donuts individually
Alive by chocolate - 4.5
Break up party eclaire - 3
Death by chocolate - 4"
Dunkin' Donuts,Sayali Kale,27 November 2017,2,They run out of coffee regularly. The store is very poorly managed. It takes at least ten minutes for them to generate the bill even when there is no one else there because their systems are always down.
Dunkin' Donuts,Cuteee Pie,07 November 2017,3,"Been there for just chilling.
Service is very good and located in a good place. Ambiance also ok.
But they need to put attention on food quality."
Dunkin' Donuts,Rhosa Nyuwi,30 October 2017,4.5,I and my friend went to have burger on a very heavy rainy day... the best part is that French fry was so yummy hot spicy feel the fresh potato... if you are a fan of french fry like me will recommend to go there..
Dunkin' Donuts,Abhishek Bhambhu,07 October 2017,1.5,"Raw potato hash, the hash browns were so raw in the middle. The burgers sauce was more on the wrapper than the burger. The potato wedges were badly seasoned.

Pathetic dunkin experience."

Dunkin' Donuts,Reema Lathi,08 September 2017,1,pathetic! don't order through them! neither do they have the decency of answering calls and informing nor do they have people to deliver! disappointing!
Dunkin' Donuts,Shoeb Patel (Food Assassin)‚Ñ¢,06 September 2017,3.5,"Taste is Awesome!!!

Dunkin' Donuts,Sai Parithosh,26 August 2017,4,The best and one and only place to eat donuts in hyderabad.... the chocolate donuts make you indulge into it and the sweetest of all........
Dunkin' Donuts,Hari Kishan Kurapati,25 August 2017,1.5,Worst burgers i ever ate... this place is really bad when compared to other outlets... half of the burgers are not available and other burgers are tasteless.. grilled chicken tasted like boiled chicken burger... will never visit again.
Dunkin' Donuts,Sandhya Menon,14 August 2017,4,"Saw the poster of Arabian iced coffee at dunkin donuts ,so thought why dont i try it out in this beautiful rainy weather. It was heaven for me when i sipped it. Chilled with rich creamy flavour with lught kick of brewed coffee. Thats how i like it.So the new addition in dunken donuts family us a cool one.Would definitely have it again."
Dunkin' Donuts,Souvik Patra,14 August 2017,3.5,"Simple and sweet outlet. I liked the episode outlet with some great graffiti. The service counter girl was kind of ride though as we said something for order and she ordered something else and then she argued. Well, for the love of donuts - The chocolate and the mango craze and the rainbow pop were awesome. Soft, spongy and colourful were the words. The taste of Mango craze could be improved more though. The chocolate over the donut was little rough and it meant that way I guess. So, overall great."
Dunkin' Donuts,Manoj Kumar Chowdary,13 August 2017,3.5,"I can't say the donuts are too tasty.if you are a sweet lover you can once try this.we ordered a pack of six and I felt no difference in each of these ,in taste they look similar except the yellow one(mango flavoured).

I didn't even feel it as fresh one ,as soon as I ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stock.overall, I was disappointed for the first time being there.

Once you can try this as a snack, but it's too sweet.
Ambience i can rate as 3.5/5
Food-3/5"
Dunkin' Donuts,Prateek Dudeja,12 August 2017,1,"Unhelpful and rude staff. According to Zomato, they are supposed to be open till 11 but the staff gives excuses to not accept orders at 10.45 also, probably because they want to leave early. On top of that, they have the audacity to behave rudely.

Don't visit this outlet."
Dunkin' Donuts,TJ'sTravel&Food,12 August 2017,4,"It took me so long to pen down this review, 6 days to be exact! And why you ask. Well that's because I had to taste 6 donuts in all.

Yess, I decided to try the festive Rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini Donuts ranging from death by chocolate, chocolate filled, mango flavored, two classics, etc. All this priced at Rs 199 plus taxes. This roughly came out to Rs 243.

So much goodness in one box!

Now I can't name each of the Donuts but I can say that majority were chocolate based. Of the 6 donuts, 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones.

The first one was the classic sugar coated. Simple and goody good.

The second one was a chocolate coated classic donut. This one was fine.

Next up the mango flavored one. This one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam. This was a fresh taste after so much chocolate.

The fourth one I think was death by chocolate. This one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate.

The fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling. This one was ok.

The last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling. This one was good. The topping had some sprinkles too.

All in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there.
Definitely a must try.

Breaking away from my usual style of writing I will come to the location and ambience after the food.
So this outlet is located on the ground floor of SLN terminus. Very easy to locate. The board is visible from the road.

The interiors like other Dunkin Donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs. On a Sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded.

Service was good. No issues there. Would love to visit again!"
Dunkin' Donuts,Foodie Cookie,12 August 2017,3.5,This has been my favourite donut place here. I tried almost all the flavours n varities they offer in donuts. Last week I tried their burgers both chicken n veg. The veg burger was horribly bad.. the other one was okayish. So I recommend this place only for donuts!
Dunkin' Donuts,Sudheer Reddy,05 August 2017,3,"It's a new kinda place for new kinda food which is donuts. I liked the donuts but the beverages(hot & cold) are not upto the mark.

Ratings:

Food and quality: 3.5/5 (above average)
Service at the counter: 2.5/5 (below avg)
Ambience & seating: 3/5 (average)
Overall: 3/5

The service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they're treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in Hyderabad.

However the taste of the beverages is very bad. The below are the beverages we tried.

1. Tough guy cappuccino
2. Mocha chip
3. Jamaican rum with almonds

P.S: Just try varieties of donuts or burgers. Don't go for beverages."
Dunkin' Donuts,Revathy Mahe Periyasamy,01 August 2017,3.5,"Ate ma first donuts here üòãThey we're just amazing üòã The ambience is so good üòç A perfect evening treat after a tiring shopping @SPAR
Mango Craze & Alive by Choco are my favorite üòç"
Dunkin' Donuts,Simran Tantia,01 August 2017,4,I really liked the donuts. Specially all the chocolate ones. Its in spar market in kondapur. I really nice place to have donuts. Apart from donuts they also serve burgers.
Desi Bytes,Smrati Saxena,23 May 2019,1,"after reading reviews, i was having high expectations from this place, so i ordered litthi choka. if you are a big big fan of soyabean then only you'll be able to eat food otherwise they put lot of soyabean oil in everything which make food taste so bad."
Desi Bytes,Safa Iz,15 May 2019,1,"The one star is not for food, it's pretty decent.

I visited with my friends and the crowd was really less. We were there for a short period of time and awaiting our cab. The staff was constantly asking ""Aap ka hogaya?"".

We informed that we are waiting for our cab and the one of the staff member pointed out there is your cab.

They just wanted to get rid of us, was the place crowded no? were we eating there for free? no.

Never visiting this place again..."
Desi Bytes,Hemavathy Reddy,14 May 2019,1,This is the quantity of chicken garlic fried rice.... Everything we ordered is of so less quantity.... Terrible I hate to spend 800 and still be hungry... Total embezzel
Desi Bytes,The Lazeez Mizaaz,06 May 2019,4,"Litti chokha lovers missing this delicious dish in Hyderabad can definitely give it a try. They serve litti with 3 variants of chutneys, chokha and salad.
Chokha was a mixture of potatoes, tomatoes, brinjal, garlic and green chillies.
Littis were properly baked and had sattu in it. Overall a healthy dish. I also tried mutter panner here. It tasted good.
The vibe here is happening with good music and they also have birthday celebration space.
I would recommend this place."
Desi Bytes,Paramita Ghosh,28 April 2019,3,"This place is becoming a nice go to place in the recent times. Live music, affordable pocket friendly food and good service! Litti chokha is one of my favorites here!"
Desi Bytes,Alisha Bajpai,22 April 2019,3,"Ordered litti chokha seing good reviews. They sent 2 littis with chokha, two chutneys, onions and lemon. The littis were good enough however the chokha was bland..the only taste i was getting was of mustard. No freshmess of coriander, flavour of garlic, or onion taste. Both of the chutneys wrre tasting almost the same. The only dominating taste was of raw mustard which overpowered everything. The food lacked freshness.
They need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours."
Desi Bytes,Rupesh Singh,18 March 2019,3,"Its an open space eating place famous for their litti chokha. Although they have a range of options to order.

Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha. They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni.

The service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through."
Desi Bytes,Vijay Tiwari,03 March 2019,5,"From long time was thinking to go this place for Litti chowcha. Today was the day we went for dinner.

This was best litti chowcha I had after I left my home town.

Just @100

Must try litti chowkha.

People was thinking what is litti chowcha, it is the famous dish of Bihar.

Food : 5/5
Value for money: 5/5
Service: 4/5"
Desi Bytes,Medha Parashar,19 January 2019,3,"Open air ambience.. Just beside road.. Live music..
Specialty - litti chokha.. With the best chutneys.
Please don't have momos they suck..
I can just recommend this place for fresh air with litti chokha and nothing else.. So all 3 stars gors to litti chokha."
Desi Bytes,Akhilesh Khemka,06 January 2019,4,Litti chokha was yummy. Although delivery took more than displayed time. Liked them delivering 3 types of chutney as well. Will order again.
Desi Bytes,Vikashtiwary1991,26 December 2018,1,Not good and my experience is not at all good . The litti chokha is very hyped here but I do not feel the same it was below par . The other food experience is also not good
Desi Bytes,Asha Bishnoi,17 December 2018,5,"Best place for hangout and I can say it a saviour for hungry people. Food quality and quantity both are good.
We have order chur chur naan combo in which they give you 2 stuffed naan, daal makhani and raita and it was yummyüòä"
Desi Bytes,Jatin Bansal,16 December 2018,5,"Amazing place to unwind. Must try chai. Very live place, perfect for late night chai. One of the coolest hangout place in Kondapur. Must try"
Desi Bytes,Sourav Datta,15 November 2018,4,"This is THE place for Litti Chokha. (drops the mic)

Food : 4.5/5 The Litti Cokha is just amazing, sitting in Hyderabad and getting such quality food that reminds you of your home town stalls is really something. Would have been nicer if the Chokha was a bit more hotter/spicy. But understand that such taste would not go well with lot of foodies here. I have gone there again and again for Litti Chokha and have very rarely tried other things. This time tried the Chinese plate and really liked that too.

Service : 3.5/5 It was a self service join which now services your table. Timely service and good behavior there is very little more to expect.

Ambiance : 3/5 Has a very nicely maintained outdoor sitting beside road.

Price : 4/5 The place is very reasonably priced for Hyderabad standards (though 2 litti for 100 bucks might sound expensive to someone from east India ;) ).  Portions are good and taste is impeccable."
Desi Bytes,Nisha Bachhawat,04 November 2018,4,The litti size was splendid. The chokha was perfect and the three chutneys along with lemon and onion was simply too good. Really loved everything.
Desi Bytes,Shikha91singh91,04 November 2018,5,"Love litti chokha.. littis were well stuffed, aloo baigan and tomato chokha was awesome.. they are serving 3 chutneys too along with that. If you are a litti chokha lover and living in hyderabad, visit them.. you will definitely love the food."
Desi Bytes,Rupsa Sinha,04 October 2018,5,felt like having home made chicken
Desi Bytes,Ashish Kumar,23 September 2018,3,"Litti choka/chicken litti choka is the dish which one should go for in this place. It drags me here every time and mesmerizes my taste buds. A plate of it will full ones stomach. Taste is quite good. Quantity is sufficient.
Have not tried other dishes, but would love to try them too."
Desi Bytes,Foodies Hyderabad,21 September 2018,4,"I have ordered chicken hakka noodle,chilli paneer its was mind blowing..its was so yummy,i will like to suggest to give the order from this restaurant....the packing style is also good...thank you..."

Extremely pathetic of this restaurant as well the delivery boy...
I am sure I am not going to use zomtato or this restaurant services in future..."
Desi Bytes,Rithi,12 September 2018,5,Good food
Desi Bytes,SHYAMAL,11 September 2018,3,Litti Chokha* This is actually they're known for .. back in Patna they're serving on of the tasteist litti in town.. But if we really see for something mouth watering near me.. With a budget of 90 bucks .. I really don't recommend if you're not in search of *LITTI CHOKHA* They're good but They can be much better.. I hope you'll know after tasting it once. I don't really believe to spend 90 bucks for a litti Chokha when I'm hungry and have more options in this price..üòÅ

The service was quite fast and prompt, but the food portion was less w.r.t the price. They serve only 2 small leg pieces for 120/- whereas you can get 4 pieces for 160/- at Siddique, where it tastes far better. The music system is great, with some heavy bass and a good playlist. There is an open seating, which can be a big problem during the rainy season !"

Desi Bytes,Debangana Tarafdar,02 May 2018,3,"This open air restaurant situated right at the mouth of the Whitefield turning, has branded itself as a Chinese and North Indian restaurant, but the Chinese on offer was not good at all. The soup we ordered had a weird taste, and we did not dare to venture further into the chinese menu, the restaurant had to offer.
The Litti chokha on the other hand was pretty good. And, they even claim to serve the best litti chokha in town. Can‚Äôt say whether it‚Äôs the best or not, but they did get it right."
Desi Bytes,Sande Sharma,01 May 2018,4,I was passing by that road and was instantly connected with the restaurant's set up and live music. Its an open air and add to that is the soothing live music.I thought of trying a quick snack and the staff helped me choose one. Litti chokda was the dish.it was delicious. Then I presumed to order some pander makhani and burtter Roti. It was nothing short of heaven ! Loved it and would go again..

Hyderabadi Daawat,Priyabrata Panda,24 March 2019,1,Biryani tastes stale.Highly unethical service. They will charge you 40rs for a 20rs coke(250 ml). Never ever go or order anything from these cheaters. And even after calling the restaurant multiple times they won't pick up the call rather they will disconnect it.

The food served here is delicious and mouth-watering. The pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the LCD Tv's. Just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds. If you are going with a group of 6-8 members, I suggest you order platters instead of individual starters.

We have ordered Chicken Platter and Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter. The chicken Platter comes with 4 variety of chicken starters with 6 pieces for the each variety. And Veg platter is served with Paneer Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Broccoli and starter of cauliflower. Both veg and Non-veg platters tasted great.

In the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant *Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam* It comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema. Leaving the Hyderabad biryani aside, this was the best main course item that I have tried in the recent times. It easily serves for 3-4 adults. And it is really a must try dish if you're visiting this restaurant. Apart from that we have ordered Paneer Pasanda with zafrani Roti. The Paneer Pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it.

And coming to desserts we have ordered Kashmiri Rabdi and Kaddu ki Kheer. Both of them are really good.

Service:

The service here is really commendable. The staff is cordial and always available at your service. Within no time from ordering they serve the food hot at your plate.

Value for money:

I can't comment on the vegetarian food but for the non vegetarians this restaurant is a treat and the prices are worthy enough. We can try a variety of dishes which we haven't even encountered in the menu of regular Hyderabad restaurants. So mark it and visit this place for your next dining. Have good food and great experience :)"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Silpa Acharya,22 March 2019,1,I have ordered paneer pasanda yesterday night and received totally burnt paneer and uncooked gravy with a ton of turmeric..which was smelling disgusting..I couldn't even took a bite.worst food I have every received.
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tasty Hyderabad,21 March 2019,5,"As the name suggests, this place serves the authentic hyderabadi cuisine. This is a new place in town. The place is very spacious with proper seating arrangement and can be visited by friends and family. The staff was very courteous and friendly.

We first started off with Yakhni shorba which is a mutton soup. Then we tried few starters Daawat khaas-Murg sholay kebab, Phuket fish, Wok tossed chicken, Sikanderi raan and Daawat khaas- Chelo kebab.
Then we tried main course Nalli gosht and Murgh lababdar with bread, Murg musallam and Hyderabadi mutton biryani.
Then the mocktails Virgin mojito, Mojito fantasy(strawberry), coolers(coconut, cucumber, lime, mint), Mango mule, Blue hawaii, Soda fountain.
We ended our day with the desserts Shahi tukda and phirni."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Keerthi M,17 March 2019,2,"*Dum Biryani taste was average no spicy.*

I don't know reamaining dishes. I have only orderd dum Biryani. but I am not satisfied with the dum Biryani taste bcz no masala added. I felt like white rice I am eating.chicken piceses also no taste. I can give 2/5."

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tummyful_hyd,16 March 2019,5,"Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad! Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before? No not the hotel we're talking about a function, well if you've been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu! And here at Hyderabadi Daawat, the restaurant, you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy! The hotel is very easy to locate! Its on the main road...while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you're coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left! The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors, very calm and cozy place! They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions! And after the ""DASTAR"" was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA! Shorba is nothing but the soup! Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir...people in the North tend to have it more! And it is a very good source of protein! Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy! But the taste was fantastic! It was the best way to start off Your meal! Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken, Phuket fish, Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab! Let's start with what we loved the most: The Sikandari Raan! ‚ù§ It's one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep! You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren't usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely! The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do...cause it just MELTS! And talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated! Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN! Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam! After winning one of the battles in 300 B.C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish! And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan! Well, we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan! A must must have for You all! Highly recommended dish if You're here! üòç The next best starter was the Phuket fish! It's a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce! The taste was of another level! Next we had the Wok tossed chicken! Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming! The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew! Soo we recommend the chef to look into that! And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab! It was the Barbeque styled chicken! Very nicely marinated and tender to eat! And the presentation was amazingly done! üëåüèª After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab! It was extremely well presented! Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs! The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour! After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar, Nihari Gosht, and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan! Nihari Gosht was Love! ‚ù§ it wasn't like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis! It was different and very thick and spicy! And the mutton which they used was really tender! Do try this dish here! Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo! üòç Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places! Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice! And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs! You should definitely try this dish! ‚ù§ We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani? We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions! The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani! üòçüòç And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat...Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha! Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad! It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added! And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot! ‚ù§ Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it! And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person! He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile! Way to go Sir! üëåüèª"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,14 March 2019,4,"This place is only a few months old. It's true that Hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of Cafe's, bars, food joints. The new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.
Hyderabadi Daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.
It excells in real flavours used in Hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.
Starting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. From the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. The signature mocktails and a must try outs are Mango Bloom, Soda Fountain and Strawberry Mojito.
Coming to the starters, it's the best to begin with some soup. Yakhni Shorba is the best try out soup.
Phucket fish, wok tossed chicken and Sholay Kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. Sikandari Raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. The presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.
Heading to the main course, Hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. This place has amazing Mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. The aroma is literally breathtaking. Chicken Tikka lababdar and Nihari Ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. The main ""main-course"" is Murg Massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. This dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. After a full on meal desserts are a must. Matka Firni and Double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.
The staff here is very polite and friendly. The ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. The place has a huge space of sitting area. The indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.
Overall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing Lunch or Dinner. Most recommended!!!"
Hyderabadi Daawat,‚úîÔ∏è Sonu,13 March 2019,2,Just average üëé I had paya shor a from this place and must its not worth. You can have it alongside rice or roti but not all alone like a soup. They gave 2 small pieces infact very small and the quantity also too less. Utne mei kya hoga? Infact #payashorba is an absolute waste from here. Completely disappointed. I have given 2 stars just for the packaging. Well it was neat. Rest all I don't prefer to have from this restaurant againüëé.
Hyderabadi Daawat,Venkat Katta,06 March 2019,4,"Review is for delivery only.
Ordered Dum la Murg Asifi, with roti and nan.
Little disappointed with quantity of curry. Was too less. But the taste made it worth the quantity. It was fantastic. Thick rich creamy gravy with almond paste. Absolutely blown away by the taste. Only if quantity was improved it would have been a perfect 5."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Prithvi Kudupudi,02 March 2019,5,One of the finest dining experience I've ever had!!! Absolutely loved the food and staff were very courteous and they really do their job every well!!!
Hyderabadi Daawat,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,08 February 2019,1,"Probably i am having a bad experience with Hyderabad food these days. So i thought of ordering from a 4* restaurant to be sure.

Ordered masala kulcha. They definitely dont know what a kulcha is and what masala is. It was a tandoori roti. With a little carrot dressing. How can they charge 50 rs for that? Above all this, it was slightly over burnt and had no butter.

Surely not ordering from this place again!"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Anam Farid,04 February 2019,3,I ordered biryani from this place. Biryani was very dry. Rice didn't have any taste. Without Salan it was not possible to eat the biryani. Major part of the rice was white without masala.
Hyderabadi Daawat,Ayoub Mohammed,02 February 2019,4,"Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Venkatesh Kumar,01 February 2019,3,"Looking at the overall rating & the close promixity to our office, visited this place for lunch along with my team today. Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). Nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

Veg: Not that great, we ordered Panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, Sabzi Nawabi Handi & butter naan for mains. Panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. As suggested by the staff, we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. Service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

Non veg: Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Asad Rana,31 January 2019,2,"Ordered chicken Biryani from this place last night and it was delivered within 45 min with good packing.

Coming to the food, biryani was not upto the mark. Rice was quite plain and don't have masala, however it looks amazing but lacks the flavour. there is one thing called less masala or spices but rice here was actually more on the bland side, rice quality was superb but taste was missing which usually Hyderabadi Biryani have. Mirch ka Salan was decent so as the raita, chicken pieces were having some masala and spices but somewhere some of the pieces were little raw from inside and not completely cooked. When eaten with mirch ka Salan and pieces then only there was little bit of taste otherwise it wasn't decent enough also. Ordered from Zomato on special prices otherwise the price tag which they have is high. Didn't found this biryani value for money."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Pratap,30 January 2019,3,"Ordered Chicken Biryani, Shahi Tukda and Malai Kebab through swiggy. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.

Chicken biryani was good, rice was flavourful. Rating: 3.5/5

Shahi Tukda was good, liked the taste. It's a must try.
Rating: 4.5/5

Murg Malai Kebab was not good though, the chicken kebab pieces were undercooked. The kebab pieces were raw and chewy.
Murg Malai Kebab: 1/5"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Manchikatla Harikrishna,30 January 2019,1,"I ordered veg dum biryani through zomato and i got just coloured basmati rice without vegetables, one packet gravy and water curd. There is nothing other than colour basmati rice, there is no spices also. never order online from here and I don't know about dinein"
Hyderabadi Daawat,MD Soheb,29 January 2019,1,I have ordered chicken biryani Worst taste and the chicken was not fresh dont waste ur money. I had a bad experience i would never recommend anyone this restaurant
Hyderabadi Daawat,Viswanadha Raju,26 January 2019,5,"Nice place with good food and ambience. Ordered Mutton shorba and the chicken platter, very tasty and well served in short time. No waiting for long and the staff also very polite. Recommend this place."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Somak Das,20 January 2019,5,"I have ordered many combos, biriyani , chelo kebabs and thai restaurant never disappoints. Consistent quality , freshly made food, brilliant taste. This rating is based on the food only as I have never visited the restaurant. Keep up the good service."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Debdut Modak,12 January 2019,5,"Today I ordered chicken Dum biryani...the food was really awesome...i loved it
Keep up the good work... cheers ü§òü§ò
The quality and quantity was superb"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Vicky,12 January 2019,1,"What a bad food serving this restaurant for high price. I ordered today and found food was awful. Before going hear be careful about your health. What I received from this restaurant cold nans uncooked rice, overcooked paneer. From my end zero star. Sach a awful food."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Pardhu Pinnamshetty,11 January 2019,5,"Two items on the menu really stand out and you can visit this place just to try these no matter how far you stay. One is the Yakhni Shorba, loved it. The other is Sikandari Raan which is a lamb leg made on coals. The meat is, to put it like the great food connoisseur Charles Boyle, succulent and flavourful. Really gives work to all your five senses."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Mohammed Abdul Vadud,09 January 2019,5,Awesome Restaurant and food tastes yummy Yummy! Must visit again n again. Would recommend with family friends and buddies. Real Hyderabadi Nawabi restaurant.

I strongly recommend of fine dinner occasions."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Kanishka Saini,05 January 2019,4,"I went to this restaurant with very high hopes. And turns out that they were successful in satisfying them.
Ordered murg Sholay kebab which were properly cooked and tasted delicious.
In main course, I had murgh makhanwala. The waiter served me paneer sabji instead but they were quick in changing it and the owner also gave a complimentary roti to make it up.
The restaurant is a good place for family dining and the service is satisfactory."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Rajigandhi,03 January 2019,5,One of the best biryani I have ever had‚ù§Ô∏èChicken pieces in it r cooked to perfection with the blend of spices.. Delicious üëåMust visit for hyderabadi cuisines
Hyderabadi Daawat,Khushboo Pandey,03 January 2019,4,"Ordered Navratan pulao, sabz sheek kebab and 250ml colddrink for 545 rupees and review is based on that.
Quality- 5/5: The food was awesome, great taste just they should have given some raita or chutney with pulao eventually i was bored of eating pulao, it was less spicy and more sweet
Quantity- 3/5 : The quantity of pulao was good but sabz sheek kebab was very costly just ten piece for 260 rupees is too much
Value for money: 4/5- the quantity was less still it could be considered valuable as the food was very tasty but the cold drink MRP was 20 and they gave it for double price dont know if they added some thing in colddrink from there end that they charged double
Overall is recommended if you eat less and have extra money to spend"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Shreya Karmakar,02 January 2019,5,Viola!!! Have been looking for such a place for long. Very reasonable and humble staff. Gets you in the true feel of trying mouth watering Hyderabadi cuisine. Murgh Musullam is among the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hyderabadi Daawat,Siva Kanagaraj,30 December 2018,5,"Ordered Chicken Biriyani after 2.30 pm, this was on time arrival by zomato, piping hot with blend of masala and rice, raitha is not watery like others, it was good and will try again"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Omer,29 December 2018,5,Awesome Authentic delicious food. I ordered a family pack. Received on timeüòä. Food was very well packed. Biryani is just too delicious. Have it once and you'll start loving it. Felt the taste of biryani after so long time. Thanks to everyone from the restaurant.

These are also must try itmes..
Good Staff and Service.."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Sanjita Mandal,17 December 2018,5,"Ambience is decent and quiet.
All orderd items tasted good.
Tamatar ka shorba was great.
Nizami handi added it's own taste in main course flavour."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Mohd Zubair Ali (Hyderabad.Food.Diaries),13 December 2018,4,"I am a huge fan of regional cuisines. The diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range India possess. It also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it‚Äôs just a festival of flavors. Cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like Hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the Nizams, Rayalseema to telugu cuisines.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of Nizams. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and I was really excited to go for it.

As I went in for a dinner, we started with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba, a great start to the meal. With every sip, the intense flavor starts to get you. Then there was an array of appetizers that really got me. We had the Achaari Paneer Tikka, where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix. For the non vegetarians, we had Murgh Kalmi Kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix. The Gosht Seekh Kebab was wonderful as well. It was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the Patrani Fish. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste.

The restaurant also took the pain to present us their special Sikandari Rann, where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor. It was served on a bed of fried onions, garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day. Moreover, there were also some Persian Chelo kebabs and Murgh Mussallum for us to enjoy, served along with their range of condiments.

 The Rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us. We had Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. The Nargisi Kofta was my favourite of the night. It just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it. The Gosht Masala was spicy but the Achari Chicken was incredible too. Desserts like Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal.

In a nutshell, the true culture and authentic flavors of Hyderabad is being exhibited here. So, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list! Go give them a visit!"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Pavan Dg,12 December 2018,4,"People say there is nothing called veg biriyani, but Daawat serves you the best veg biriyani in Hyderabad. Been here 3 times in a month and all the time the taste was same. The mixture of rice is masala is very perfect.
Hope it continues to be the same."
Hyderabadi Daawat,BOBBY REDDY PALLE,12 December 2018,4,"Located diagonally opposite Platina it has excellent ambience. We just ordered Mutton Biriyani which was excellent. They have buffet also but was not available on that day as it was an election day.
Ambience: 5/5 Taste: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Value for Money: 4/5
Overall Experience: 4.5/5"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Rmandava70,09 December 2018,4,Stopped for lunch here. Service is very quick and polite. Ordered two family pack biryani for 7 of us. Quantity is quite good. Moreover the biryani is awesome. One of the best biryani places in and around. Keep it up.
Hyderabadi Daawat,Aamir Nawaz,04 December 2018,3,"Dishes Tried: Sikendri Raan, Murg Musallam

""Wasn't a big fan of the raan, Murg Musallam was spot on. The staff was very nice and welcoming. Loved the decor as well."""

We had been to there for a Sunday dinner.
We had chicken lollypop,chicken lasooni tandoor and chicken dum biriyani.

Lasooni tandoor was good but a bit flat in taste. There were no much spices.
Chicken lollypop was good .
Dum biriyani was superb with the tender chicken pieces.
The service and staff were awesome at there part.
Great work. Looking forward for another dinner party."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Foodies Hyderabad,02 December 2018,5,"The place was in the list when my friends told about that, the ambience is awesome, everything about the place is design to give a wow feeling,
Coming to the food part , food is very tasty ,finger licking, the portion size is also good enough."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Kamaal Ahmed (zaiqebaaz),27 November 2018,5,"Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!"

Hyderabadi Daawat,T V Satyanarayana,22 November 2018,4,"Went for a casual with my roomie to this place. The ambience was nice and looked like a good restaurant. Ordered Chicken Shorba, which is similar to soup prepared in chicken stew and pepper. For starters ordered Tandoori murgh Adraki, it was served hot and really delightful. The taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored. In the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and Murg tikka lababdar. Murg tikka was awesome, it was not too spicy nor too blunt, it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken.

Only word of advice for the management is PLEASE STOP APPLYING GST ON PRODUCTS SOLD AT MRP SUCH AS COLD DRINKS AND WATER BOTTLES. GST should not be calculated on those products.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Bharath Kumar,22 November 2018,4,"Dum biryani @ it's finest. They wrap up the hyderabadi flavour quite well and have started to be known in the biryani and food circles of Hyderabad now.

Ordered Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani for a late lunch 2.0 üòÇ today. They did not dissapoint me and I am happy I chose this place to order.

For a good, lip smacking tasty hyderabadi dum biryani, you may definitely go ahead and order from them.

Their packaging and service is also neat and hygienic. To be noted.

Recommended.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Rajesh Kumar,16 November 2018,1,We have gone for veg buffet and the starters were not sufficient for even 4 or 5 people. No starters were served even after an hour. Taste wasnt good at all of any item. Not worth any penny.

Hyderabadi Daawat,The Fit Foodie üòãüòéü§ë,15 November 2018,4,"Nice little place for lunch parties. We were almost 100 people and went for lunch buffet. The ambiance is okayish nothing to write about but seating arrangement is quite spacious. Coming to food we were served with 3 starters chicken malai kebab, chicken lollipop and Apollo fish. All of three were awesome also the vegetarian ones also tasted nice. Didn't try main course much as I was enough but there were enough varieties in chicken mutton and prawn. In desert there was one kheer and one Gil a firdoos really well made. Overall a pleasant experience."

Suggestion for team is to add little more rice to the dish."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Avinash Tummala,11 November 2018,4,"Visited this place today. We ordered murgh kalmi kebab, Tawa Fish & Chk Dum Biryani. Kalmi kebab is good. Fish is a bit smelly and the taste is average. We liked the biriyani very much. It took more time to prepare the food and the service is very good."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Vishnu,09 November 2018,4,"Food quality is good and hygienic. but they dont provide more gravy and raita, onions for Biryani.  need to improve  food orders packing and serving to customers."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Atulay Mahajan,08 November 2018,4,Paid a visit on the occasion of Diwali. The serving manager was very courteous and humble. He suggested some good starters and we finally picked up Veg. Garlic Sticks. Shorba is a must try. Dal Makhni with Roomali Roti is Heaven. Double Ka Meetha was way too ‚Äòmeetha‚Äô. Overall the preparation is sumptuous and pocket friendly. Must visit.
Hyderabadi Daawat,Omair Omair,06 November 2018,5,"I am a crazy eater. This is THE best among the best restaurant. Very beautiful ambiance and so is the food and service. Highly recommend this restaurant. Spoke to them, they have party hall and party orders. I will host my next party here!!!"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Sahithi Sahi,05 November 2018,1,"Food doesn't taste good , zomato delivers spoiled food and they take days long to resolve it . agent has to be assigned he has to take over the issue and then escalate all shit process goes on.,......"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Junaid Aziz,04 November 2018,4,"'Say no more!'

Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!

I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!

The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!

The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.

Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for ‚Çπ1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!

Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!

Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!

Why Hyderabadi Daawat? #authentic

Will I Specially go to HD? Sometimes :)"
Hyderabadi Daawat,Manaswini Buddappagari,31 October 2018,4,"It's always good to see restaurants which focus on Hyderabadi cuisine since it's so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it. Hyderabadi Daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good Hyderabadi food.

The restaurant is located on the Gachibowli - Kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. The interiors are classy and comfortable.

The dish that started off the Daawat was the Yakhni Shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.
Achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.
Sabz ki Shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.
Tandoori Aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exterior
Murgh Kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.
Gosht Seekh Kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a Seekh Kebab but they nail it here.
Patrani fish and tandoori Jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.
Their main course comprised of Murgh Mussalam, Nargisi Kofta, Achari Murgh, Shahi Paneer, Dal Akbari, Gosht Masala.
Their Sikandari Raan and Murgh Mussalam deserve a special mention.
A variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the Lemon mint cooler, Cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and Coco Baliney.
Their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Unsophisticated Foodies,31 October 2018,4,"The name is a giveaway here! This place specialises in Hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session.
Ambience- Decent with ample space. It's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.
Food- This place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.

The food was well prepared and presented overall. I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.

The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie. Even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Yash Kumar Singh,31 October 2018,4,"I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.

Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.

Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.

From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.

Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.

The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Rafey Mohd Abdul,31 October 2018,5,"Being a big foodie myself, I would say this is the best fine dine place for all types of cuisines.. The ambience and hospitality is great to match up to it's delicious food.. There are two exclusive dishes over here which were sikendari raan and murg musallam and I have to say that those dishes will keep you wanting to come back to this restaurant again and again..."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Hyderabadfoodexplorer (sanchay Gumidelli),31 October 2018,4,"So the place is named as Hyderabadi Daawat, is actually not just hyderabadi food. They have turned this up to a multi cuisne serving hyderabadi , mughlai , oriental and a bit of continental. We though here were just to try the mughlai , a bit of hyderabadi and a little north Indian style of food. Lets check them out. #hyderabadfoodexplorer #letsexplorehyderabad ...

Hyderabadi Daawat,Karthik Gandhi,31 October 2018,4,"Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. 

My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.

Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). 

Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKofta

Do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)

Hyderabadi Daawat,Bismaya Kumar Purohit,01 October 2018,4,"A newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a Sunday afternoon we landed.

A quick confirmation via Zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.

Menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. Earned a 1/2 star!

Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.

When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !

Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.

With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.

My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Advait Shiralkar,24 September 2018,2,"the restaurant ambiance was really spacious and cozy. But the food was not so good. the starter veg kabab platter, the paneer was really hard only the aloo was good. we directly went for veg and chicken biryani. which was okay but not so good to. the service was good. i forgot to mention the mocktails that were mojito and ginger peach they were a bit to sweet."
Hyderabadi Daawat,Nitin Shiralkar,23 September 2018,3,"A newly opened Daawat restaurant on Kondapur road. We visited on Saturday evening without prior booking. The decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting.

We ordered Mojito and Ginger peach mocktails along with Daawat khas veg kebab platter. Mocktails were good but little too sweet. Veg platter was good but nothing excellent. Paneer particularly wasn't so fresh. We directly went for Veg and Chicken dum Biryanis. Again, both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary.

Overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich. You can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sanskruti Mishra,21 May 2019,5,"My husband and I, visited Zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed.
The service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa, which had a perfect blend of spice. Followed by an array of dimsums, each being delicious and warm. The chicken Gyoza was absolutely mind blowing. I could eat a zillion of those!
The dimsums (which we were full after) were followed by the main course which included fried rice/soft noodle with chicken and fish(we did not try the vegetarian dishes)
The cherry on the cake was the dessert! Toffee banana with ice Cream. Ugh! Delicious!!
Our bill was ~ 1700/- for 2
Worth every penny.

Ambience-5/5
Taste-5/5
Value for money-5/5(surprisingly)
Service-4.5/5

Will I visit again? Yes, maybe for a different food festival this time!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,#FOODPORN,15 May 2019,5,"Delicious,mouthwatering dishes and a must try dim sum lunch which is pocket friendly. The view,service and the food are 10 on 10. Kudos!!! to the team"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Siva Chakravarthy,15 May 2019,4,The place is lovely. The food was damn tasty. I lovers the service and the respect they showed towards me. Good atmosphere with nice dim lighting and the music.
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Shreshth Malhotra,13 May 2019,4,"Zega is a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of Sheraton Hyderabad. The restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic Pan Asian dishes that one could ask for.

I went there for their ongoing Dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.

The first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.

Next up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.

For mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.

With out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.

All in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. Happy eating. :)"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Vinay Talagadadevi,09 May 2019,2,"It's been a very long desire to taste the pan Asian food at Zega, very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet, well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar, coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request, taste of the food was just ok, need to relook into the clasic dishes, over all it was a very average dining experience at zega."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Pallavi Kadam,03 May 2019,4,"Was on Vacation in Shareton Hyderabad .18 04 2019 Went to ZEGA special occasion on my birthday . ambience was stirring,dim light ,soft music ,gloomy  we were in celebration mood ,we requested to taste wine before selecting  one

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Surendra C,02 May 2019,5,"Awesome place to visit . The Great Ambiance and access to roof top and the view from roof top is amazing in the night. The food is very delicious and service was awesome , I thank staff Sai and Neel for their best service and very friendly and polite receiving. Over all Superb place and I love to visit again. üç∫ cheers üçª ."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Mihir Bhagwat,23 April 2019,5,Beautiful ambience and great views since this is located at the 10th floor of the Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel. Food is extremely tasty! Butter-Garlic-Lime Crisp Fish and Classic Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice were our favourites. The staff are very polite and give good suggestions which suit your food palate. Definitely worth a visit!
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Akash Dhand,23 April 2019,4,"It was an IPL Sunday evening when we went to this place, the food tastes really good unlike other 4-5 star hotel restaurants where food is average. Ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me. The highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top.
We order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done. Specially mention for Butter garlic fish (if u like buttery flavour) which was just superb.
The only thing which I didn‚Äôt like was the portion size which was too less.
And yes you get booze served here even on dry days üòâ"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Avin Seth,16 April 2019,5,"Crazy place with crazy people mad over drinks üç∏üç∑. A place that is open late in night to havve after party scenes. Rooftop has a great feeling of its own. Ambiance is awesome. Its a party place with great music üéµ.
Cheers Rakshita Nath"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,KRS,08 April 2019,4,"I had visited Zega on Weekdays for Lunch few times earlier and felt underwhelmed overall. Last visit for a Sunday dinner changed the perception however. First of all, the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel, and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height. I am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better. Food order was two varieties of veg sushis (the crispy one was very well made), soft noodles, and a coconut based Thai curry (which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach, very well made overall). And the place was quite packed as well making it lively. Overall, worth visiting."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Bhaskar Roy,05 April 2019,4,"Excellent food, fast n efficient service. Grilled pork belly was the best, sushi will be memorable. Can't wait to visit again to try the sushi platter!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Dheeraj Goud,03 April 2019,5,Night life and Saturday weekend parties are fun after long busy schedule when it‚Äôs time for weekend I would suggest. My frnds to go to Sheraton gachubowli and party all night ambience is gud all the staff and bartenders are respectful and polite and it‚Äôs my regular hangout location with my frnds
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Siva Sampath Tutika,02 April 2019,5,"Went to this place for lunch. Opted for a Set Menu with the on going Dim Sun Festival. Soup was good. Dim sums were awesome and they served a wide variety of Bao, Gyoza, Dim Sum, Wonton. Main Couse was ok with Rice and Noodles. Desert was Fried Banana in Caramel Sauce with ice cream. Desert was good as well.

Ambience - 4/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Epicure,21 March 2019,3,"Was waiting for longtime to be @Zega with the rating it possesed. B&B, Zega Mojito,Herbal Delight,Oriental Fantasy , Blushing Dragon were ok but not that great! Chilli chicken, fish, paneer were also of subtle taste. The lamb starter should have been more soft & in eatable consistency. Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt. Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent. Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste. Schezwan veg fried rice was below average. Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service.Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,DPTT,07 March 2019,5,"I come here often. Wonderful food, lovely ambiance and most amazing staff. Try their lotus stem appetiser. We take red curry for our main course. And I love their basil martini (their bartender makes it amazingly well). Special kudos to Kyn and Pradipto for Their most welcoming smiles and their attention to detail. They really make our dining experience awesome. we will come again."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Ramaiah Chowdary,02 March 2019,5,"Hospitality by Mr Sai , customised food by Chef Manisha and ambience made the dinner a perfect set . I strongly recommend this place for Asian cusine and wonderful fine dine experience. The support staff are very courteous and understanding; they were very patient with my little daughter. Many thanks for that !!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Eshita,28 February 2019,4,"We have been to this place for a special occasion and we loved every bit of the offering this place had in store for us . The food , ambience , service and nevertheless the service of the host. The dishes were rightfully suggested and we dug in fully satisfied. This is where I tried the first Sushi platter in my life . The starter and the main course were equally good. This visit will be memorable ."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Asim Behera,26 January 2019,5,Amazing place with access to the terrace for a great view. Excellent variety of food and taste. Wait staff is friendly and polite. What more can you ask for!! A must visit place.
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Wes Licmoan-Ragot,09 January 2019,5,"What an amazing ambience!

Good and cozy interiors. Nice view outside and the food? I can‚Äôt even begin to say how good it was.

The sticky rice pork balls? So tasty.

Arjun assisted me the entire time. He was so nice and attentive. He offers me other options if what I want is not available.

He makes awesome cocktails!

Thank you Zega"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Vasanthan Lr,08 January 2019,4,"I‚Äôve visited this place located on the tenth floor of Sheraton hotel for a Sunday lunch at 3 pm. Should I say the service was slightly ignorant? They seemed taken aback by having to serve me at that point of time.
Anyways,
The hotel is magnificent and provides a beautifully view of the city if seated in a right place.
Chicken gyoza was rightfully bland. 3/5
California uramaki , great as always . 4/5
Japanese minced prawns , chicken skallion and butter skewers - was impressed by the name but not so mouth watering and very bland. 3/5
Everything tasted better with he side chutneys!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,The Beauty_Chef,03 January 2019,5,"This luxurious restaurant is located in one of the most posh areas of Hyderabad. Situated on the 10th floor of Sheraton, the extravaganza starts right from its entrance. Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!! Not a highly preferred place, however, you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Binayak Prasad Ray,26 December 2018,5,"The dining experience at Zega was truly splendid. Every item we ordered was excellent and the stir fried prawns in Chef‚Äôs special sauce, in particular, deserves a special mention. But what set this place apart from almost every other restaurant was the service provided by Arjun and Kuldeep, which can only be described as exquisite. Their dedication towards customer service is truly remarkable and praiseworthy.

Marvellous food along with top notch service provided for one of the best dining experiences till date!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Raj Medhi,17 December 2018,4,"For a never ending thirst for alcohol when everybody says shut,you can drop by for a drink , not a huge place but you will love it , came here only for late night 2am drinks , it was amazing and cozy with some good service attenders with good with respectful hospitality,though i forgot the attenders name he won our heart , never ordered food so wont talk about it,i assume it will be good as well."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Indranil Mukherjee,16 December 2018,5,Wow üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ Really a great place to spend evening with the Great Music and Great Staff behaviour. Food is really nice with the Thai Curry and Jasmine rice at the end was simply marvellous. The view from the restaurant was simply outstanding. Comfortable seating with attention of the staffs will take you to a different world. Special mention for Neel - keep it up....
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,AJ,15 December 2018,5,"Very good place for dinner!
Love coming over with friend and enjoying the tasty good. Would definitely recommend the Pad Thai for people that like noodles."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Swethan Anand,04 December 2018,5,"This is a fantastic place. I rated them 1 star on my first visit. They were apologetic (invited me again immediately) and I didn‚Äôt show up until after 10months because of the traumatic first visit. They have upped their standards significantly since. Best hot and sour soup on par with any Chinatown joint across the world - bamboo shoots, shiitake mushroom and all the works. Gyoza is good. Heck everything they served was good on my second visit. Special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks - a true professional. Her Nirvana cocktail is just that - sinful pleasure. I went there on consecutive weekends. Tip - go during the day because it is well lit and has a wonderful view outside. I will be there again. Cost is very reasonable for the place which is a very pleasant surprise. I will be there again for some more of the Nirvana potion."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Aman Kumar,29 November 2018,5,"Chinese cuisine is a comfort food for me. And the chef quickly noticed this after a quich talk with him. I curse myself for not remembering his name now.
Chef prepared a special chicken fried rice for me as I was not in a mood to order from their menu. And it was pure magic. I also ordered the dimsums which recalled me my darjeeling trip."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Geeta37,15 November 2018,5,We went here especially to have Sushi and was satisfied with the food .Ambience is perfect and loved the reception too. People who loves sushi I would definitely recommend this place .

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sudhakar,09 October 2018,5,Visited Zega with my guests from abroad. We had couple of cocktails which was excellent and the food was really delicious. Rubina and team was just superlative at their job. She suggested us good food and the service was excellent. It was a nice experience and we had a great time.
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sandeep Sinha,05 October 2018,3,"Great ambience, excellent customer service, good city view but below par food! We ordered Sushi, prawns, gyoza, ice creme for dessert. All food was average in taste. If you‚Äôre looking for good Asian restaurant, there‚Äôre better speciality restaurants which serves better Asian fare. However, if you want to dine at upscale restaurant with good customer service, this is the place for you. if you find yourself here, give their homemade ice creme a try!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Pooja Dhingra,03 October 2018,3,"We went to Zega for my brother's birthday celebration, the ambience was great and food was amazing, however we were disappointed with the customer service.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Akansha Satapathy,10 September 2018,5,"Been to Zega about 5 times now and have stuck to the same choice of orders - Celery Dimsums, Som Tam, Thai Green Curry and Pad Thai. Although the proportions are quite small, the food is lip smacking good. It is authentic and a delight to my taste buds. The ambience is beautiful with calming elements. This my go-to comfort food restaurant that I would recommend to anyone looking for authentic pan Asian cuisine!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sharath Chandra,07 September 2018,4,"Cozy atmosphere!

Place looks amazing. Located at high floors and view is good as well.

Too less options in food when it comes to Indian or Chinese in Zega.

Finally, a place for drinks with royal ambiance around.."

The taste is pretty authentic. The staffs are extremely pleasant and makes you feel comfortable.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sachin Narayan Iyer,21 August 2018,4,Amazing place with variety of dishes and drinks to enjoy your time to the fullest. I have been here many times but I would suggest you guys to reserve your tables before visiting so that you need not to wait for long especially during weekends. have fun
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Phanindra Goutham,16 August 2018,5,"I've been to this place long back with one of my friend. Never though of writing a review about my visit but when I came across couple of pictures which were captured there, made me to write this. I would rate this place 4/5 for food beacuse the fried rice that we have ordered, though it was tasty it is oily. For the service this would deserve 5/5 because from the time I've entered I was heartfully welcomed by the hostess and was shown a proper place for seating. And the bar man was so interactive with us which actually misses in other bars. When I have to write about the ambience, this place deserves a bow. Ambience inside the bar is awesome but the ambience from the rooftop would be mind blowing. Would love to go there again and again."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Soumyadeep Das,15 August 2018,5,Best restro in Hyderabad..food was awsm.and staff behavior really good..bt I mentione one of them who welcomed me ( Barnali Mukherjee)wid sweet smile n polite behavior.. the way she welcomed ppl it's really appreciable.

From the food I ordered to the service I received & to the minute little details of the place were truly inspiring- like the name suggests. I loved having ""Banana toffee with salted caramel ice cream"" - mouth watering dessert. Deepak suggested us the desserts. His service was amazing I have added Zega as 'the must visit restaurant in the city'."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Avik Ghosh Gluttonous_Bhukkad,04 August 2018,4,"Sheraton is a big brand in the Hotel Industry and famous for its cuisines! One of the best place for a fine dine experience, the restaurant is of high class with a gigantic bar.

The seating is decent, food menu has limited options, yet the flavors are deep rooted.

Order some Keema patty, Keema Pao and Cheese maggi. The menu seems ordinary, however, the taste is top notch. The cold coffee is average, and needs some serious work.

Nothing much to say apart from the hospitality of the amazing staff. Do visit for sharing your experience!!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Bishal Saha,30 July 2018,5,"I frquent this place. Love the ambience and hospitality. Great food and amazing music. Best place for after parties. Great service.. worth mentioning are Rubina, Neel and the whole team!!"

Warm welcome of the hostess barnali .
This is the best place for dining ."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Gaurav Bhide,03 July 2018,3,"This place is good unless you look at the menu card. It's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.
But if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.

DJ plays some really nice music.
And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Raj,02 July 2018,3,Super expensive wala restaurant that you spend with black money!! Stay away if you are putting your own... view is also not that good.. interiors are stale

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Bondrazi,25 June 2018,4,Great place with good ambience and out of this world buffet . A bit pricey with the 1500rs tag but is good to once in a week or 2. Overall great experience
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Vinodh Iyengar,23 June 2018,4,This is an amazing place to hang out. 10 th floor. Ask for Neel or Arjun to get best of the hospitality. Sai is the masters for making the deadly drinks. Awesome place to unwind. Be here and you will realise. Crispy veg is a must to try and feel the heaven. Kailash Manager is a head strong guy who doesn't know the courtesy to treat the customers
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Ishan Verma,21 June 2018,5,One of the best Asian Restaurant's in the city. Promising food and service as well. Liked the hospitality offered by Ms. Rubina. That was amazing.

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Deo,20 June 2018,1,Would not like to even give 1* as Service was pathetic. Staff was appearing to be busy and had no courtesy to attend our table in the centre of the restaurant. Starters were served after main dish though they were ordered much before. One of the staff half served a dish to a couple of guests on our table and hopped to other table without finishing her task without any apology. We had to keep on asking for a dish (Sushi) which was ordered 90 mins. before it was served. Noisy place...
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Abhishek Kumar Singh,11 June 2018,2,"Table was not clean and there were stains on it, obviously not a 5 start standard. Food was ok ok not something great with limited variety on menu. Service was below average as they were not prompt I had to wait every time to get something served on the plate or need to call them and ask to serve. On a whole the experience was very poor. Nothing great when I visited with my wife for dinner."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Tanya Dutta,07 June 2018,4,"Great place, good music and late night hours. Wanna party after 11pm - zega is the place.
There is a rooftop to chill on and the club to dance at. Crowd is amazing and perfect for after hours party."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Maheen,06 June 2018,4,"Very nice and cozy place. Great place for sushi and chicken starters. Vegetarian do not have much options though. We ordered ‚Äúprawns tempura maki‚Äù and ‚Äúdragon sushi‚Äù, both were amazing. Mock tails have a very limited menu (but that‚Äôs how it is :D) The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Ambiance is cool. Good music and they have private seating sections too. This place is open until late night, hence, giving a little levy on time. They have a nice terrace (city view) which is open for everyone. Do visit this place if you want to try some amazing ‚Äúsushis‚Äù."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Ritika Thakur,05 June 2018,4,"Nice plan, great Asian food.
Amazing and hospitable people.
Good ambience.
We went here for a group dinner with 25 people, the staff was very nice and courteous.
The food was nice."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Kirti Singh,01 June 2018,3,"Late night place. Open till 4am. Food was okayish. Nothing great about the place apart from the fact that it's open late night and serves booze.
Ambience: 3.5
Service: 5
Price: 3 very expensive (not worth it)
Taste: 3
Food quantity: 3

We ordered kung pao chicken, homemade icecream, beers and some rice."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Kaushik Nath,28 May 2018,4,"There are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. This one's different. The restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. The food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. The presentation was great. Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.

However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.

It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.

Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5. But, I really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Rudra Pratap Sing,28 May 2018,5,"Wow zega! You people are best in city. Rock ice, innovations in cocktails attract me all the time.. thank you so much for giving me surprise all the time.."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,ShilpA,27 May 2018,5,"If there is one place where one can get good food, excellent service, a beautiful ambience without the snootyness of a 5 star, it would be zega. We visit this place often esp at night. Pradeepto the bartender is v creative and makes some excellent drinks..based on your preferences (in addition to what's on the menu). Definitely worth a try!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Lu Lee,16 May 2018,5,"Favorite place
A very good place,to hangout with a late night bar
Staffs here are really amazing helpful an very friendly,,, food are delicious,,"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Rachna Pandey,03 May 2018,4,We've been here a few times and quite like the pan Asian fare. The service is also prompt. The view of the financial district is great especially in the evening so go for window seating
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Neelima Zakkula,26 April 2018,4,Nice place.. it's in 10th floor.. love it!! Have very less options for indian cuisine. Had tasty dimsums and chicken chilli as starters. Wish there was some live music on weekdays..
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Floyd De Mello,22 April 2018,5,"A very modern restaurant with excellent ambience, service, food and music. They take hospitality to the next level by treating every customer like a king. No restaurant even comes close to this. Nothing to complaint really... so 5 stars to them."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Vnikhil Reddy,21 April 2018,4,"Love this place & there food is great , good place to hangout after 12:00 am midnight roof top is so peaceful at night I will visit this place again in future"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Chandrani Saha,17 April 2018,3,"We went for a family dinner on 15th April. Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Hasitha Dharani,15 April 2018,5,"Went to zega for our first wedding anniversary-thoroughly loved it. The staff is super friendly and the food and drinks were amazing.
Special shoutout to the cocktails- tasty as hell!
Definitely going back here again!"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Addie B,12 April 2018,5,"Zega is just the right place if you're a fan of Asian food.
I keep asking for the kimchi :)
Nothing can go wrong with your order here just feel free and order whatever your heart permits and your tongue ask for it.
Everyone offers you great service especially Kirti (the pretty girl in her suit I hope am recalling her name correctly)
Namaste from Aditi üôè"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Anushma Ghosh,10 April 2018,4,"Had been there for lunch on a Friday afternoon. they have a very cosy atmosphere with a wonderful view of the Gachibowli Road from atop the 10th floor. Their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed. we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy. there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate. Their Maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best. Then we had the Chinese barbecue Pork belly ribs which was chunky, succulent and juicy. in short, we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon."
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Kishor (Kannu),09 April 2018,5,Beautiful place to hangout with friends and best thing about this place is amazing food and their great service and killer view from roof top
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Rani Kumari,21 March 2018,5,"Great place to dine..... The sushis are awesome and the ambience is the best you can get.... dj plays some nice tracks staff is corteous Deepak helped me in selecting the cocktail. believe me Nirvana is the best zega cocktail

Best tym to visit late nyt"
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Youbee,17 March 2018,4,Great place to hangout with friends. Some of the best Asian food you can get in this area. I really like the Kung Pao chicken and their signature lamb chops. Cost is a little on the higher side but well worth it.
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Foodvert,11 March 2018,4,"Nice place for a dinner date.
Food is good, Ambience is good, Service is Good.

Tried thai, taste was good, wasn‚Äôt click worthy, no complaints though."
Triptify,Kamal Rana,18 May 2019,1,"This place might be good but it's the worst now. Ordered a Chicken Keema paratha and got some vegetarian paratha instead.
Not only was the order incorrect but it was burnt!
Zomato refused to help on the issue."
Triptify,Nidhi Arusia,08 May 2019,5,A very nice option for Paranthas lovers with so many different options. The taste is quite good and I love that they provide option to customise each combo so that we can select any combination of Paranthas. The Packing is also really nice. Totally worth it to have 5 star :)
Triptify,Yogesh Kumar Gupta,08 May 2019,1,"I wish i could have given you a 0 rating. The wheat used to made the pranthas did not seem fresh, also the green chutney was stinking.. The paranthas are too dry to be eaten alone. Except packaging, nothing went well."
Triptify,Ashish Jain,07 April 2019,1,"not cooked properly, no paneer in paratha"
Triptify,Priyanka,03 April 2019,1,"I have ordered chicken shawarma paratha, which was smelling worst and tasting bitter. Money and hunger both went in vain. Never order food from this place."
Triptify,Mahathi Natva,02 April 2019,4,"I ordered the combo of aloo paratha and paneer paratha. I really like the quality and quantity that they give in one serving along with the curd, green chutney and pickle and a small butter. It is really a wholesome and flavorful meal for a person. If you are craving for some home style paratas this is a really good place."
Triptify,Gopal Mishra,02 April 2019,5,Good ambience.. Great food.. Well I would say best Parathas out there in the area. Served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. Comes in Great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. So less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need.
Triptify,Ankita Trivedi,31 March 2019,1,My whole order was wrong. Moreover I received burnt parathas in the order. Zomato refused to issue refund for my order. This is really inconvenient and disappointing.
Triptify,Shaily Naik,27 March 2019,4,"The parathas actually tastes like an authentic North Indian dish ! Not a big fan of spicy food, but liked the parathas A LOT! For ppl like me who prefer low spice food shall make a special mention !"
Triptify,Prateek.6668,26 March 2019,1,"Ordered Garlic cheese paratha and got live cockroach as accompaniment though i got full refund but that's not the solution.
Triptify's service is getting worse day by day.
Anyways it was my last order from triptify."
Triptify,Suman Basak,26 March 2019,1,"Food used to be good. But live cockroach came out of the food for the second time! Just apologies from customer service representative is not the enough. Quality control has to be talen seriously. Till then, no Triptify. Adios"
Triptify,Tushar Vaidya,20 March 2019,1,I have ordered two parathas. Paneer paratha was fine but gobi Paratha was over roasted and not edible at all. Attached pic of over roasted paratha. I think rastaurant should take care of this during cooking.
Triptify,Mitali Agrawal,20 March 2019,4,"I ordered parathas from this place and I just loved them.
Alloo and paneer parathas were very good. Though corn paratha was average in taste.
I really liked their garlic chutney."
Triptify,Varun Reddy,22 February 2019,1,worste quality. got hair on the food.
Triptify,Yudhik Agrawal,20 February 2019,3,Mexican corn parantha was rubbish.
Triptify,Mamta Chaudhary,13 February 2019,1,"Not the good oneü§≠I ordered chicken keema and chicken cheese prantha from the bestseller list. the stuffing was less,and the prantha was not soft, it was heavy in quantity and very hard. No taste in stuffing, no salt no spice.
What i liked from the triptify is the packaging üëç. No offence üôè genuine and honest feedback üåπ"
Triptify,Akrit Kashyap,20 January 2019,5,Great guy and good service and on time delivery
Triptify,Sauptik Saha,14 January 2019,1,I found dead cockroach in food. It ruined everything. Hygiene needs to be improved a lot. Cant guarantee about food quality. Sometimes food is extra salty.
Triptify,Sidthefoodie,25 December 2018,5,"One of the few joints , who specialises in paranthas. Ordered Paneer paranthas and cheese corn paranthas. Paneer paranthas was awesome and had a very good evenly distributed stuffing.thier chutney , which comes with paranthas , enhances the overall flavours.Keep up the awesomeness guys !"
Triptify,P Arora,02 December 2018,5,delicious as always. Typical punjabi flavour
Triptify,Hemant Bahal,01 December 2018,3,too spicy parathas ... though they were good but they can make it less spicier.. it would be better
Triptify,Sachin Agarwal,29 November 2018,5,Amazing taste.Always likeable. Vareity of paranthas and combos is another advantage pf this place. It feels like homely food which makes your mood refreshing.
Triptify,Manvi,28 November 2018,4,"Ordered Gobi paratha and aloo paratha,
Getting used to small parathas delivered we were wondering they would do the same and ordered two items for two people
To our surprise we found the best parathas,bigger,more quality and more tastier ones.
The packaging is very good and the add ons they provide are too good.
Truly in love with their parathas‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
Triptify,Prashanth Jayanand,25 November 2018,4,"Great parathas! Their food packaging is exquisite. Do try the chicken and cheese parathas, one of the best! However, corn and cheese, aaloo, chilly garlic parathas are delicious too."
Triptify,Rohan,25 November 2018,3,stuffing not upto the mark
Triptify,Kiran,25 November 2018,5,as tasted before.. all good.
Triptify,Vedant Killa,24 November 2018,4,"Always a delight ordering from this place! üòÄ

The packaging is just so good, you get pickle, chutney, curd and butter with the Parathas.

I‚Äôve tried Paneer Tadka, Paneer, Aloo, Punjabi Aloo, Capsicum corn, Cheese capsicum, chilli cheese.
The Paneer and Cheese options are really yum. The parathas are served hot and heavy. They‚Äôre quite filling as the stuffing is pretty amazing.

Do try them for a laid back Sunday lunch for a hearty meal! üëåüèº"
Triptify,Naimish Chandarana,22 November 2018,5,"This has become a favourite place to have parathas.. they serve an Excellent quality with ample quantity of food. Fully Paisa wasool place.

I ordered paneer and aloo paratha thinking that small paratha will be delivered. But what a pleasant surprise, two monster size of parathas of each flavour were delivered. Packing was perfect and it reached my home hot and fresh. Both the types of parathas were really crumptious. Even the green chutney they serve with this was awesome. Those who have complained about less stuffing inside paratha should definitely try this. For sure, You will not be disappointed. Undoubtedly, full marks to the food.

Follow me on Instagram on veganyums_ for more food fun.."
Triptify,Nishtha Chandarana,18 November 2018,4,"Today I ordered some paratha from this place.. Delivery was on time and packaging was really good..
They send butter, curd and chutney.. chutney was tasty..
I ordered paneer paratha and aloo paratha..aloo paratha was delicious.. stuffing quantity was perfect..
Paneer paratha was luscious too..paneer masala was tempting..even paratha side's were filled with good quantity was sufficient..

Personally I loved their paratha and service too..
I definitely recommend this place..

Follow me on Instagram veganyums_ for more pics and food fun.."
Triptify,Piyush Pathak,15 November 2018,5,"One of the best places quite possibly the best in parathas. I hear 13 dhaba and parathas and more to be better in This area.i have tried them all and there is no other rather than this I will order. I am the biggest fan of alloo and gobi paratha and this restaurant would know I order every 2 or 3 Rd day the same usual deAl. Of both above parathas. They are delicious. Absolutely perfect. Packaging just the way we like it. Superb delivery time. Everything perfect. Do not change, be this way."
Triptify,Saurabh Singh,11 November 2018,5,Yummy paratha..I tried a lot of paratha from different places but first time I got the complete north indian taste..need more chutney next time and no curd.
Triptify,Kaushik Jagini,11 November 2018,4,Always used to have a craving for chicken parathas.. we were randomly looking for a place to serve our hunger when we found this one. Small and a neat place. We ordered chicken kheema paratha and butter chicken paratha. The taste was so goood. Will come back here for sure. The chutney given as a combo was yum as well. Cutting one star for the ambience. Food wise you will love it for sure.
Triptify,Ramona Sinha,10 November 2018,4,"I had heard a lot about this place and their amazing paranthas so i decided to try myself. I had ordered the combo of punjabi aloo parantha and cheese corn parantha. I loved the food packaging. The chutney, dahi and pickles came is separate containers and the parantha were packed so well and were piping hot.
Coming over to the taste, I would say i loved it. The aloo parantha was excellent. The corn cheese parantha was good too but i couldn't find any cheese in that parantha. I guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again. But I would love to try other paranthas by triptify and wpuld definitely recommend others to try this place!!"
Triptify,Ankur Agarwal,07 November 2018,4,"Ausum parathas, good packing, faster delivery. Go for cheese onion capsicum paratha and punjaabi aloo paratha. The great one. 2 parathas are much heavy for a single person. Size of parathas is huge and stuffing is really yum. Seves with pickle, butter, green chutney and curd. This time i didnt get pickle but thats ok..the parathas were yum.."
Triptify,Chandan Ganguli,03 November 2018,5,Loved the paranthas and the presentation. The delivery was prompt. The chutney got spilled but the taste made up for the inconvenience. Thank you.
Triptify,Ankit Gupta,27 October 2018,5,Best parathas in Hyderabad. Nicely packed with all the add onns needed to have great exprience. Must try. They have variety of combos in budgetary price.
Triptify,Kanika Sharma,25 October 2018,4,"Nice place to order different variety of paranthas.
Best parantha I liked: cheese corn parantha
Easy and fast delivery even in the peak hour.
Packaging is also good.
Parantha is served with pudina chutney, curd, Amul butter small packet."
Triptify,Shrey Kohli,17 October 2018,2,very spicy
Triptify,Aditi Gupta,09 October 2018,2,"We ordered Aaloo parantha for Lunch from this place. Their packaging is really convenient , compact, handy and presentable. The package had 2 big stuffed parantha, butter, curd and green chutney. 

But the paranthas were very thick, less cooked and under stuffed. Also i was expecting pickle in the package."
Triptify,Shraddha Singh,08 October 2018,3,"I ordered Paneer Paratha combo expecting to get something really delicious but what I received did not meet my expectations. The paratha was abundantly stuffed but it's taste was not that good. Also, it was way too thick."
Triptify,Abhilash Surapuram,06 October 2018,2,"it's not good,earlier it was good ,but today food is not good"
Triptify,P Arora,06 October 2018,4,Tasty food. However wrong chutney was sent
Triptify,Ankita Dixit,06 October 2018,5,"Ordered food recently from this place.
I think the biggest disappointment while ordering a stuffed paratha would be ""less stuffing"", but here is a big thumps up to these people Coz evrytime we ordered parathas from here the quality and quantity was maintained.üëç"
Triptify,Seshadri Reddy,05 October 2018,4,"One of my regular food ordering place and added advantage, fast delivery cause nearby location. They offer high quality stuffed parathas with curd, butter and two different chutneys. Their Mexican corn and Paneer tadaka are my favorites. Would recommend this place if you wanna try delicious parathas."
Triptify,Kalpana,21 September 2018,1,Food is too oily and chutney is too salty.paneer is not cooked well..raw smell of ginger garlic in paneer parata..parata is too dense.need to improve the quality of food
Triptify,Swarn Lata Singh,17 September 2018,5,very nice
Triptify,Akanksha Ahuja,06 September 2018,5,"So I happened to order Aloo Parathas and Mountain Dew. Full marks for packaging and the way they serve you 2 big fat aloo parathas ( just the way they should be) with pickles, butter, dhania chutney and curd. They actually kept the Punjabi paratha feel alive so thank you for doing total justice to the food you serve.
A small complaint would be adding more aloo and not make the dough too thick, but overall, it was wonderful. And just like a true Punjabi, I even burped thrice after having this meal. Paisa Vasool!"
Triptify,Pavan Aditya M S,31 August 2018,5,well served
Triptify,Vinay,29 August 2018,1,"The food was not at all good, I have ordered chicken keema paratha and the chicken was not fresh it was smelling like any thing bad experience with the restaurant"
Triptify,Anshul Gupta,27 August 2018,3,"Ordered Gobi and sattoo paratha as lunch from here. This came with dahi , butter , pickle and chutney. Gobi paratha was soft and flavoured and sattoo paratha stuffing was too much and I dint like the taste much as I couldn't get the exact flavour of it. The packing of this was excellent which came in a box packing using aluminum foil covering for paratha and every other thing well settled in the box. Overall it was okay with the accompaniments and more than sufficient for one person."
Triptify,Shreyoshi Mandal,26 August 2018,4,"Got Cheese Combo Parathas home delivered for lunch; I had chosen Aalu Cheese and Garlic Cheese options. The packaging was really compact and well done. The Parathas were very yummy and cheesy and went really well with the accompaniments they provided which constituted: Curd, Dhaniya Chutney, Butter and Pickle.
I would highly recommend this place to satiate Paratha Cravings."
Triptify,Raj Rohit,25 August 2018,5,"Oh my my. What great parathas. These guys know their game when it comes to parathas.

The corn and cheese parathas are brilliant + their sides blend so perfectly with the parathas. Brilliant packaging too."

Triptify,Riya Gupta,06 August 2018,4,"The food is good and the packing was nice too.

Chinese Pavilion,Khan,13 May 2019,5,"Starting off with food...They have amazing and delicious Chinese food for starters as well as main course. Service is good and the people are polite. Quality and quantity both were up to the mark.
A must visit."
Chinese Pavilion,Diaryofmuna,08 May 2019,3,"I had ordered Manchow Soup. The taste was very nice. It felt like a great start . Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too . It had good aroma and aura but taste was average . The restaurant had good ambience. Overall it was good experience"
Chinese Pavilion,Himanshu Chhabra,05 May 2019,1,"It is overrated casual Chinese food, with lot of oil. You can call it more of Indian Chinese. Ordered wolly chicken average. Flat noodles very oily. Thread chicken was oily. The captain/manager denied us Axis bank card discount because it was not told before. No restaurant denied me that discount before. Quantity is too much and they charged more than what was mentioned in the menu. Seriously it is an overated ""Indian Chinese"" restaurant. One star is for the thread chicken starter (oily, fried)."
Chinese Pavilion,Arun Prasad,28 April 2019,2,"Overrated place. It's a disappointment and below par as per taste. We had panok prawns, you could taste the batter, it's basically the deep fried prawns however the taste is not at al upto the mark. Schewan noddles and chicken garlic sauce is below par. Nothing great about the place."
Chinese Pavilion,Rishita Mukherjee,23 April 2019,4,It's an good place to try out casual chinese dining. Must try their royal Thai prawn soup. I got captivated with the flavour of that. Other things in the menu was good too but could be better. Service was fast and the place is quite peaceful to enjoy a meal.
Chinese Pavilion,George B.,18 April 2019,4,"We love chinese food and we headed for Chinese Pavilion to have dinner on a Wednesday evening. We reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. It‚Äôs not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.

Ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. Decors have chinese items so it‚Äôs not bad.

Service was spot on, we were attended very. It didn‚Äôt take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.

For food we had Satay Chicken sticks and Spicy Black Bean Lamb for starters, Teppan Soba Noodles Sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. The prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely. Recommend!
Food 5/5
Ambiance 4/5
Service 5/5
Value 3/5"
Chinese Pavilion,Ashima Saxena,16 April 2019,5,"Although not a big Chinese cuisine fan but this place makes you love this cuisine as much as other of your favourite ones. Service is amazing with very friendly staff. I ordered veg man-chow soup, veg mini dragon rolls in appetiser and in main course water chestnut, baby corn, broccoli wholly sauce curry with veg fried rice. Everything was freshly cooked and tasted perfect. Only thing to work upon was veg mini dragon rolls which were bit too oily. And don‚Äôt forget to try their non alcoholic beer."
Chinese Pavilion,Aamir Nawaz,13 April 2019,1,"Kinda of disappointed with the food. Everything is either drenched in oil or tastes old. Ambience is quiet. Butter garlic prawn is good though

Dishes tried:
Butter garlic prawn

Crab on toast"
Chinese Pavilion,Rakesh Rout,13 April 2019,2,"For the first time in my life someone justified to me that burnt noodle tastes as such because the item is a sizzler !! Regards to the rest, please confirm if it's crab or crab meat.. if it's crab meat , please stay off..."
Chinese Pavilion,Sandhya Juluri,11 April 2019,5,Very fast service and the food is delicious. Everyone must try the restaurant's food. really loved the food. Very tasty authentic Chinese dishes.
Chinese Pavilion,Zulkarnain Shaikh,10 April 2019,1,"I am from Mumbai, i ordered it from my hotel in Hitech city, from Swiggy.
I ordered Chicken Pot Rice, Pot rice is usually wet n not dry, this one was actually dry and it wasn‚Äôt made with the wet gravy how Pot rice is actually made, and they made chinesee like biryani, seriously! garam masala in the Pot rice was a big turn off.
it was actually Hydrabadi Pot rice lol!"
Chinese Pavilion,Manasatspmvv,04 April 2019,5,"I have been to this place in weekend, it is really great. I had Vegetarian food only which include Hakka Noodles, Manchow soup and Veg Szechuan Fried Rice. Everything tastes perfect. I have never tasted such perfect blend of flavors in any other Hyderabad chinese restaurant."
Chinese Pavilion,Anil Rao,04 April 2019,5,The tofu with mushrooms was absolutely wonderful.  Enjoyed the meal and grateful such establishments that don't modify perapartions for the Indian palate exist in Hyderabad.
Chinese Pavilion,CulinaryCurator,24 March 2019,1,"I used to love Chinese Pavilion. The Banjara Hills outlet was synonymous with prawns in chilli oyster sauce. I went with those drool filled expectations to the gachibowli outlet for takeout, and could barely finish the fried rice, prawns in chilli plum sauce. Felt plasticy. Sigh"
Chinese Pavilion,Subha V,18 March 2019,4,"Such good place for Chinese food...

Ambience: Nice and peaceful.

Taste: Very good. I had lemon grass soup since I had a sore throat and it helped me more than I wished for. Lemon, coriander, and chillies have all added to the flavors. The crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty. I could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint.
Teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good. All in all, a happy experience!

Will I visit again: Yes!

Cost effectiveness: Average. About 700 for a person.

Experience enhancers: The staff who are well aware of how the food is made. Very nice service"
Chinese Pavilion,Sravani Gade,11 March 2019,4,"Been to this place twice for dinner and haven't been disappointed. We ordered a lemongrass soup, honey potato (please lookup exact names in the menu) to begin with and proceeded to have veg soft noodles and manchurian. The manchurian isn't the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down. But the noodles were thin and light. Overall a delicious meal. Definitely recommend it!"
Chinese Pavilion,Alisha,28 February 2019,5,"Feel good place to dine with your family and friends along with having amazing Chinese food and desserts especially cheesecake!!!
Sophisticated ambience
very Polite staff
Great place for Chinese food lovers
Elegant decor."
Chinese Pavilion,Megha Saraf,25 February 2019,5,"I have to Chinese Pavilion many times and has always a very good experience. The ambience is very peaceful and calm. The interior is really good and unique. They also provide baby chair which has become a must for me. I ordered everything veg sweet corn soup, veg mini dragon rolls and haka noodles. The sweet corn soup was good and thick and tastes delicious with all vegetables. He veg mini dragons are mini spring rolls that kind of disappointed me as they were very oily. May be it's my personal choice but I wish they are less oily. The haka noodles were the best I have had and loved them to the core. I gave full points because the staff is very friendly and super courteous and the service was also very good."
Chinese Pavilion,Ajay Munjal,16 February 2019,5,The food is delicious. Service is excellent. I wish the portions were bigger since most of the dishes are for family style dining. My favorite Chinese place at Gachibowli.
Chinese Pavilion,Lovely Sharma,13 February 2019,4,"We book a table at Chinese pavilion, as name suggest , they specialized in more of Chinese or oriantal cousins, food n service was good n fast."
Chinese Pavilion,Aishwarya Banerjee,25 January 2019,1,"Not just the food the service in this place is horrible. We ordered crab meat soup which according to the menu was supposed to be spicy.
They served us a bland soup and when we enquired about it the ""captain ""(person who took the order) said we should taste the soup first before asking.
The captain was disrespectful and dismissive also charged us full price for soup that was unpalatable.
Needless to say we didn't try anything else there."
Chinese Pavilion,Syril Thomas,13 January 2019,4,"The best place for chinese lover, the food is very authentic and the service is bit slow but you can comfortably eat. Staff is very nice. Always ask for recommendations from the staff and their choices are simple perfect and that makes a foodie try the best they have in their restaurant"
Chinese Pavilion,Siva ** EPICURE**,25 November 2018,3,"We have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic Chinese. Nice ambience, less crowded & peaceful environment. Warmly welcomed by staff. Coming to food as we have kid with us, so the dishes we ordered were of less Spice. Ordered some Veg soup, couple of starters. I must say Veg soup was made to perfection, full marks. We didn't like starters; Honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & Babycorn starter has no taste (No salt, No spice). But again Main course specially Egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). Over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)

Ambience - 4/5
Cleanliness - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Food (starters) - 2/5
Food (Main course) - 4/5

Tip: Do check for spicy levels before ordering!!"
Chinese Pavilion,Aditya Kumar,25 November 2018,2,"Visited this place on a friday evening. Saw good rating on Zomato and decided to give this place a try.
This place has great ambience and decent staff. We ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good. But if you see the attached image to this review, the cucumber and salad, which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me. You would expect fresh food on your table, when you pay premium price.
We then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. The food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.
Overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though. I could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above."
Chinese Pavilion,Bhaskar Roy,23 November 2018,4,"This is my favourite neighbourhood Chinese restaurant, love the Jade chicken soup here as well as seafood. The staff is courteous, fast & love the quiet ambience, fragrance, decent & less crowded. A bit expensive (costs around 1000-1500 for 2 pax) place considering the locality but its worth the money."
Chinese Pavilion,Aakash Jain,21 October 2018,4,Ordered all vegetarian dishes and everything was good to taste but almost everything was a bit too oily. Staff is well behaved and professional.
Chinese Pavilion,Amaraneni Shiva Abhinav,22 September 2018,5,"One of the best Chinese restaurants in Hyderabad !
Love their ambience, service and obviously the food :)
Especially their Chicken dry red chilli starter with Egg fried rice.. truly amazing. Keep up the good work guys.."
Chinese Pavilion,Irfan Lateefi,30 August 2018,3,"Ordered Tom yum soup, prawns pepper chilli, fish crispy ginger. Very good soup, Don't understand why u have to use barter prawn ok taste however batter was thick. Fish crispy ginger chilli very disappointing taste less. For Main course ordered Mandarin fish and chicken fried rice, below average food. Over all ok ok place huge difference in taste when compare to banjara hills outlet."
Chinese Pavilion,Kalyan Ch,15 August 2018,3,"Soups were excellent.
Satay was ok.
Chopsuey with white sauce was not great.
I would recommend it with schezwan sauce.
Ambience is just fine."
Chinese Pavilion,Eshita,14 August 2018,3,"Mediocre food .
Ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum.
For a crazy dimsum lover , the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick , though the chicken portions were decent . The wanton soup was mediocre.
What bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served. It was still 15 minutes for the closing time.
I just feel some personal touch would have been better.
Will explore some more dishes , before commenting further"
Chinese Pavilion,Swetha Mikkili,23 June 2018,5,A decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering Chinese dishes.A good place to go by for Chinese cuisine...sizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice!
Chinese Pavilion,Samrat Chaudhuri,09 June 2018,4,I have been to this place about 6/7 times. I absolutely love this place.. all dishes are awesome...Jade Chicken Soup is a must try. Staff is very courteous and knowledgable. They will advise you on the quantity correctly. Waiting time is also apt. Ambience is also very nice.. Prices are a bit on the higher side although it justifies with its quality
Chinese Pavilion,Sushil Pandey,02 June 2018,4,"The place is very well set up with Chinese decor and comfortable seating. Everything on the menu isn't great but few things are exceptionally good. Crispy Mushroom is a must try and for sure will be a delight for the vegetarians.
I tried the American chopseuy and will not be recommending that to anyone, tastes really bad and the quality of ingredients used is just not good. Although the service staff was very courteous and welcoming, also they extended their timings for us, but food part needs to be worked upon."
Chinese Pavilion,Korak Mukherjee,29 May 2018,1,"I was here last night with 2 of my friends. We ordered pan fried noodles, Chinese pavilion noodles pan fried and spicy black bean lamb. Food was spicy and tasted fine. I have had better pan fried. However, the best/worst part follows... All of us had to take a sick leave today as we cannot stop going to the washroom. The food quality needs to be definitely checked. We don't expect this from a restaurant of your stature. Never going back and requesting others the same."
Chinese Pavilion,Ashwin Singh,25 May 2018,5,"Went to Banjara with a couple of friends, then to Gachibowli with family! Wrote a review for Banjara just now but wanted to give one for This one was as well... food is the same great thing, I like the decor more here... more modern than the Banjara place! But same great taste and service!"
Chinese Pavilion,Ch.ramya Krishna,11 May 2018,4,Been here for four times.. still didn't get bored of those dishes.. the best choice when craving for an authentic chinese food.. added only the dessert pic as I am busy while eating the main course üòãüòãüòã
Chinese Pavilion,Shiwangi Jaiswal,11 May 2018,3,I have been to this place last Sunday. We ordered soup and some tofu dish. Soup was awesome but tofu wasn't good at all. I felt the price was little high according to the place.
Chinese Pavilion,Praveen Pusa,25 April 2018,4,"Expensive taste!

The chineese cuisine served here has a delightful taste to it. The pan fried item's are the best and must try in the menu. The pricing is costly, one would feel it over priced right from the moment of the first sight of menu. Overall a family restaurant with good chineese cusine and strictly a no friends hangout place."
Chinese Pavilion,Anirudh Ev,20 April 2018,4,"Been looking for Chinese food around gachibowli and found this place ..
The staff were very courteous and friendly .. The menu also had a variety of veg and non veg dishes to try out. The ambience of the restaurant was beautiful with Chinese pottery and ceiling was full of ceramic bowls"
Chinese Pavilion,Anjali Gupta,24 March 2018,4,"I am amazed at the quality of food and service this place provides, being not too opulent in either ambience or location. This is a mighty place that would otherwise go un-noticed. But you visit once and you want to go again. I liked the taste, presentation and cleanliness. On both of my visits, the service was impeccable. Highly recommended for good chinese cuisine, both veg and non-veg."
Chinese Pavilion,Anubinda Dash,02 March 2018,4.5,The food was amazing. Do not forget to try 'Mou-chi Kay' there. Amazing sizzlers and very cordial staff. You have got t to taste the Dragon chicken as well. Best on town for Chinese ‚ù§Ô∏è
Chinese Pavilion,Forever_fooodie,24 January 2018,4,"We ordered from here via swiggy:

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc
Although we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom."
Chinese Pavilion,Aishvarya Reddy,19 January 2018,1,I have been to this place on a sunday with my friends thinking I can have a good meal and spend time with friends but the moment I arrived there it was around 2:15pm and the manager there started nagging saying that the kitchen is going to close in next 10 minutes can you please place the order. This continued even after we placed the main course around 2:30 pm too.. The food tasted good but the nagging was annoying..
Chinese Pavilion,Sandhya Menon,16 January 2018,4.5,"Saturday afternoon we decided to try out this place.I liked the ambience this place had... Ceiling mostly filled up with ceramic bowls... Very beautiful.

Ordered
Soup :Jade chicken, chicken manchow
Starter:Teriyaki chicken,Chicken banana leaves
Main course:Wolly chicken, Chicken fried rice, Chicken Haka noodles

Every dish I liked. Jade chicken soup was something new for me & having spinach in I was wondering how it would taste. But to my surprise in was too good.Terriyaki chicken was excellent. chicken fried rice was something that I dint like much but Haka noodles was a good one. Would recommend to visit there once as they also serve small portion which is really very innovative & helpful for customers to try more dishes.

Ambience:4/5
Food:4/5
Service:5/5
This is now my new Chinese food point"
Chinese Pavilion,Avinash,09 December 2017,3,"Ordered Chicken mushroom tofu soup via swiggy. The dish was hot but the taste was okayish. Was expecting chunks of mushrooms, tofu and chicken. But most of it was shredded.

Overall it was good to taste in winter evening."
Chinese Pavilion,Mujeeb M,01 December 2017,3.5,"Food: Chinese with a touch of Indian masalas. Enjoyed the taste.

Service: Messed up our order (brought us a different dish that the one we ordered). But on the whole, polite, courteous, and helpful in understanding all those foreign looking Chinese dish names.

Ambiance: All the Chinese pottery and dishes really remind you of the Oriental East Asia."
Chinese Pavilion,Rahul Pandit,18 November 2017,4,"Good ambience, courteous staff. Normally not a rush hour during the afternoons (2nd visit during noon hrs).
Tried green Thai curry (great but cld be a little spicy)
Awesome Chicken American Chopsuey (one of the best in town) It is supposed to be on a sweeter side & it's bang on.
Ginger chicken & fried rice is a good bet as well."
Chinese Pavilion,Faisal Mohammed,07 November 2017,2.5,"I am a regular to Chinese pavilion Banjara Hills but this was my first visit to Gachchibowli & I was disappointed.

The place is not bad, easy to find, valet and comfortable seating. Service was decent as well.

Food was outrageous, the order was chicken corn & manchow soups which were ok, Prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was Pan Fried noodles, if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu??

Vegetables - Baby corn, Brocolli appeared stale and they got a WIERD mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. I eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.

Stay away from Pan fried!!!!"
Chinese Pavilion,Krishna Peddinti,01 October 2017,5,Some restaurant's have figured their identity. This is one of them. Bamboo rice and honey glazed chicken all day! Ask for the blueberry cheesecake and indulge yourself.
Chinese Pavilion,Prakrita Kapoor(CrackDownFlavors),16 September 2017,4,"No nonsense interiors add an elegant touch to the ambiance.
Quick feet,friendly and humble staff make your visit a memorable one.
We ordered:
Jade Soup:This could seem a lil bland according to many.But for me spinach broth with sliced garlic was packed with oriental touch.For a change shredded meat in Soup was not rubbery.

Sea Wars : This appetizer was blend of fried prawns,fish and squid .The chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish.

Fook Chook Fried Rice: White sauce (not cream based) topped Fried Rice had a subtle flavor.It was loaded with vegetables.

Honey Noodles with ice cream : Texture of the Noodles here was nothing like the ones I tasted earlier.Fried Noodles had a fudgy Texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream.
Fruit punch was decent.But pinacolda has to be improved.
I recommend you to visit this place if you enjoy oriental cuisine sparcely infused with Indian flavors

Chinese Pavilion,Akanksha Ahuja,13 September 2017,4,"Chinese Pavilion is one of the best Oriental restaurants in Indira Nagar to satisfy your cravings for Chinese food. The decor is blue and subtle and the blue pottery that ornaments the restaurant is breath taking. The food is above average, but nothing mind blowing. It's a good place to satisfy your food cravings but don't expect something new or out of the world."
Chinese Pavilion,Rajiv Kurian,14 August 2017,4.5,"Never have been disappointed when we have been to the restaurant. Serves some lovely authentic Chinese cuisine. The server always at hand to help serve & give some good recommendations.

Good ambience also! Keep it up!"
Chinese Pavilion,Mujjuiz1,11 August 2017,3.5,Your quest for authentic Indo Chinese food that tastes great and suits your pocket ends here. We went on a weekday and were given good attention by the staff. We had the manchow soup and chicken drumsticks for the starters and haka noodles and fried rice for mains and were not disappointed. Overall a great experience.
Chinese Pavilion,Hungry Eyes,23 July 2017,5,"If its Chinese then it's this place ! No other place in Hyderabad has Chinese food this good ( well at least till now )
Let me start of by complementing the service of this place- such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable, the owner Mr. Ali, who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet. The food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.
Our order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles saut√©ed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! The food was exceptionally good ! Each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan I've ever had ).
Food and service was mind blowing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wishes to have Chinese. And yes this place is going to become my second house, you'll see me here way too often from today"
Chinese Pavilion,Agnimitra Chakraborty,14 July 2017,5,"Visited this place along with couple of my Harley riders. The ambience is superb, calm and they were very light music which was soothing for your ears. The service was pretty quick and the guys were very decent.
We have ordered Tom Yum Soup with added mushrooms, chicken fried rice and roast lamb oyster chilly.

The taste was delicious and the presentation as well as the quantity was quite good. As we were full so couldn't order any desserts.

Chinese Pavilion,B Pradhan,14 July 2017,4,"Good food.
Specially try chicken banana leaf, thats nice.
Overall good place to eat, may not be that great ambience. Staff are good and responds well.
If you like chinese, try this place as well."
Chinese Pavilion,Sakshi Singh,06 July 2017,4,"I have been here like 3-4 times and have tried Dragon Chicken, Schezwan chicken noodles , chicken soup, spring rolls...Out of all these Schezwan Chicken noodles is my favourite..
Must say one of the best place to have Chinese food in city.

The ambience is good , but one can face problem with the parking as there is very less space outside the restaurant,but otherwise it's good."
Chinese Pavilion,Deb,19 June 2017,3.5,Lust for authentic Chinese food takes me to this place and believe me they never let you down. We had Chicken sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup. Tasted great. For the main course we had Fried Rice and a Chicken side dish. Good food coupled with okayish service but compared to the place pricing is steep for sure.
Chinese Pavilion,Mansi Tripathi,12 June 2017,4,As soon you enter the restaurant you get an all authentic Chinese restaurant feeling. Quite good in ambiance and the decor is apt to the restaurant's menu. The food was absolutely delicious and had authentic Chinese flavours. We had schezwan sauce based noodles with vegetable Manchurian and both of them were absolutely delicious. You must visit this place if you love Chinese.
Chinese Pavilion,Varun Khanna,11 June 2017,4,"Been here multiple times, and Good food, ambience is unique and classy. Service is prompt and courteous. Will recommend highly, and definitely come back again."
Chinese Pavilion,Abhishek Mandal,10 June 2017,3,"Recently visited this place. Decor is simple yet nice. Ambiance is Okayish with some soothing background music, good to focus and enjoy your food. However food was average. We ordered a rice, a noodles and a chicken side dish and all were average."
Chinese Pavilion,Kaushik And Neha,03 June 2017,3,"Hello, 

This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit. And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. 

I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. 

Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. 

All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. 

Will I visit again? Probably not! I am sorry! 

Thanks!"
Chinese Pavilion,Adnan Ali Khan,10 May 2017,4,Really loved the ambience. Staff was very polite. Very delicious food served quickly though it was busy. But very expensive when compared to other restaurants.
Chinese Pavilion,Shakti Kheria,09 May 2017,4,"Go-to place for chineese food in Gachibowli Hyderabad. Manchow soup was really good. Mushroom, broccoli stir fry was also very auhetically sober and tasty. Last was well-done the garlic butter noodles. Tasted great with little vinegar and red chill sauce.
Chineese Food: 4/5
Ambeince: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5

Value for money: Totally specially with mini servings offered by the place."
Chinese Pavilion,Suhas Bhatt,26 March 2017,4,"Good ambience and presentation. Thai flavor is very authentic. I really like the way they cooked tofu. We asked for mushroom free food. But they gave food with mushrooms.When we informed them, they apologized and immediately replaced it. Which was a good gesture."
Chinese Pavilion,Kabir Kashyap,12 March 2017,4.5,"I was told by one of my colleague about this place. I found it amazing. First of all its situated at Gachibowli above Cafe Coffee Day. The ambience is good but the service, quality and quantity of food is amazing. We had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing.
For main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken. I must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words.
Then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream.
Mousse was good but the volcano was really really good.
I would say a must place to go if you are looking for good chinese food and are bored with Mainland China üòÇüòÇ"
Chinese Pavilion,Shilpa,26 February 2017,4.5,"One of the finest in chinese restaurants. This is a perfect blend of a silent quiet dinner ambience with great food. Wait till the end to try the desert, thats the show stealer.. üçú"
Chinese Pavilion,Foodie Cookie,11 February 2017,3,"I have tried prawn pepper chili , Chinese pavilion special veg noodles ,fried rice and some other Chinese cuisines from here. The prawn was very good .So was the noodles . though It had a plenty of veggies it was overpriced. Last time I ordered fried rice which didn't taste good plus I found something in the food that made question their hygiene . Never going to visit place for that."
Chinese Pavilion,Ratan Postwalla,10 February 2017,5,"Chinese Pavilion in Banjara Hills used to be a regular and favourite haunt during my business school days, and visiting the Gachibowli branch brought back all the right memories. The Spicy Crab Soup, Three Treasure Vegetables, Shanghai Prawns and Yong Chicken hit all the right spots and made it one of the best Chinese meals I've had in a long, long time.

Chinese Pavilion is all set to be a regular haunt again!"
Chinese Pavilion,Ashutosh Jambhale,09 February 2017,3,"Restaurant serving a Chinese cuisine on gachibowli mehdipatnam road. The food is not so great and doesn't have that authentic taste. The dishes they serve are different but fails to impress interms of presentation, taste and even price.
The ambiance is good and doesn't have anything which will make you feel wow. The restaurant is costly so look at the menu on zomato before you enter the restaurant. One of the dishes we took was totally burnt. The quantity of food is good compared to other restaurants.

#FoodShaukeen #ChinesePavilion

Chinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant, and I wasted no time in suggesting this üòâ. Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro.
Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.
Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI.
Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. Red Chilli Prawns (dry), BBQ chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. Prawns Teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good. BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. Three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.
Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected. Schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles üòï.

Service : Though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. Something that is important from customer point of view.

Bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. However, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side. I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception."
Chinese Pavilion,Aditya Goyal,13 January 2017,4.5,"Chinese authenticity in budget. Loved everything about the place. Staff was courteous, food was amazing and authentic. Must try veg Manchurian gravy and bamboo rice. Haka potato was amazing as a starter."
Chinese Pavilion,Suvashri Dey,09 January 2017,4,"Liked the food, the Tom yum soup was okay. The chicken n prawn appetizers were pretty good n tasty. Prawn in oyster sauce was nice. Overall a good experience considering we were a group of 15 with 2 infants ..."
Chinese Pavilion,Vishesh Agarwal,07 January 2017,3,"It's very over rated on Zomato. Went to check based on the rating and my love for Chinese Food.

Wonton soup was the best I had. Ambiance and Service was 4/5. Food is a no no with prices falling on higher side"
Chinese Pavilion,What's In A Name?,02 December 2016,3.5,"Went there with friends.The staff was polite.Had the royal Thai soup veg,loved it.Liked the dumplings but the quantity was just 4 tiny pieces,which was very less. The Hakka noodles were decent.the bamboo rice was not as good as I had expected it.the chestnut curry was okay.overall everything was okay, nothing was bad."
Chinese Pavilion,Samir Majhi,27 November 2016,5,"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad. Food is splendid and its never crowded. The waiters are connoisseurs.

The Royal Thai Soup is what a soup should be.
The Roasted Lamb with Superior Sauce tastes great with the pepper sauce.
The Pan fried noodles will make your day.
Oh and the chocolate mousse will give you sweet dreams."
Chinese Pavilion,Sumanth,26 November 2016,4,"Just went due to the zomato rating. Small place, may be 40-45 seater restaurant. Close to offices. Has valet parking, which most of the small restaurants doesn't have. Staff is courteous. They have a daily course meals round the week. Good option instead of buffets. Every item in the platter is good. Nothing wrong to point out. Lighter on pockets, go for it. with Bhaskar Varada"
Chinese Pavilion,Sattam Ray,13 November 2016,4.5,"Amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes Chinese Pavilion. Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! The chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. The best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. I am going with a 4.5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place. This is honestly one of the few Chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an Indian touch. Worth a visit any day!"
Chinese Pavilion,Manav Mohanty,12 November 2016,3,"The food was just average. Staffs were very nice. Serving time was also nice. The taste of food can be betternwith beyyer cooks. Comparing the price to the taste..... Its not at all worth.

Considering the area, I believe no one is serving better than them."
Chinese Pavilion,Ankush Agrawal,04 November 2016,4,"The place has authentic Chinese food. We had soup, starters and main course. The food was delicious and service was very nice. The ambience of the place is suitable for fine dining."
Chinese Pavilion,Divya Gupta,23 October 2016,5,"Dinner at Chinese Pavilion was a delightful experience. Delectable food coupled with great serv@ice!

For starters we had ordered Man chow soup & lung fung soup. Both the soups were tasty. Thumbs up to the dragon rolls and crispy baby corn.

In main course we had ordered Schezwan Fried rice, Tepan noodles, water chestnut, baby corn & mushrooms wholly sauce - very yummy!

Thank you team for awesome service!"
Chinese Pavilion,Karthik Gandhi,11 October 2016,4.5,"Chinese Cuisine including diverse styles from various parts of chine has not only influenced the food landscape in various parts of Asia but across the world. One of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. India has also embraced so much of Asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of Indian Foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of Chinese Cuisine. Chinese Pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in Hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense Chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  I for one of them was a fan as I dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with Fellow Foodie Bhais exactly after a year and I had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded The Best Chinese Restaurant 2016 from Times Of India . Big bow to Owner Mr. Sayed Ali and also our foodie Guru Taher bhai for making our menu selection so easy and making it one of the memorable dinner in recent times hands down. ...

Chinese Pavilion,Sidharth Singal,01 October 2016,4,"Had dinner here yesterday. Went here without reading any reviews and were hence with no expectations..very good place for veg. Chinese. They have got everything right.... Ambience, service and most importantly food.. waiters were friendly enough to suggest items in menu basis our preference. Courteous service and great food at reasonable price ( considering the portion size).... What else do you want."
Chinese Pavilion,@FuloriBinaChutneyKaiseBani,05 September 2016,5,What a delightful place. Food was the star here and we were left literally grinning ear to ear by the end of it all. A feat considering how grumpy I was at prospect of consuming vegetarian food on account of Ganesh Chaturthy. But one sip of Vietnamese noodles soup later we were already celebrating. Halfway into Thai red curry/steamed rice I had already activated my man-vs-food mode but it all abruptly ended after my wife swiftly got everything parcelled. Happy.
Chinese Pavilion,Manasi Puranik,18 August 2016,4.5,"Writing this right after having a very satisfying take out meal. Chinese Pavilion never disappoints! Every item in the menu is delicious and distinct! The soups, chicken in banana leaves, bamboo rice, veggies with water chestnuts and so much more to love!"
Chinese Pavilion,Gopi Krishna,14 August 2016,3.5,"Searched for Chinese cuisine nearby and I found this cuisine with better rating but with high costs. Thought of visiting this place and really it made my day.
As soup is one of my favorite dishes I started with Spicy Crab soup.
It was good but found something was missing in it.
I tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome.
Thai Basic chicken fried rice was good. Not that Spicy but I the rice was very dry. It might tasted better if it was bit wet.
Betki fish tossed in crab meat was very good.
That was a great experience with a great ambiance and good service.

Chinese Pavilion,Mad Foodie,28 July 2016,4,"Veg Review :)

I have visited its other branch in Banjara Hills many times and have always liked their food.... So wanted to give this branch a try.

Food here is great too..

Dishes ordered:
Pepper fried Paneer - I personally don't like starters if they are very crisp so couldn't enjoy it much....

Pan Fried Noodles - Amazing :) Loved it!!
Mushroom Pepper Chilly - Good but felt it didnt go very well with noodles
Brownie - Very soft and juicy"
Chinese Pavilion,Deba Das,24 July 2016,3.5,"Initially thought of going to Wonton (Gachibowli) but on recommendation from a friend arrived here for dinner. Restaurant is located near the Gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above CCD. Restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. The staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. We ordered for POTATO BALL HONEY PEPPER SA, DUMPLINGS, VEGETABLE MANCHURIAN, VEGETABLE BLACK BEAN NOODLES, 3 TREASURE VEG CHILLY. All Dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. There was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in Kolkata shops. We were disappointed with Manchurian as they were too much salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. Overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. We also had cakes which we brought from outside. They were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.
TASTE 3.1/5
SERVICE 5/5
PRICE 4/5. There is NO SERVICE CHARGE ON THE BILL."
Chinese Pavilion,Shankar Kosaraju,23 July 2016,3,Had a mixed experience... Cant say it is bad cant say it is good... It is ok. We ordered soups and they are fine... Later on mixed sea food... Prawn is ok and squid is very smelly... Another chicken starter it is good. Coming to main course... Ordered crispy noodles and it is ok and then korean noodles also ok... Veg noodles is good. I recommend to try it once.
Chinese Pavilion,Swarnabha Mitra,18 June 2016,4,"Ordered a lot of dishes from this place and and none let us done. Was very happy to eat good Chinese food in Hyderabad after such a long. We ordered spicy crab soup, Mongolian Chicken, Prawns Teppan Yaki, Chicken Pan Fried Noodles,Mix XO Fried Rice, Roast Lamb Oyster Chilli, Sampan Chicken. Every dish was cooked to perfection. Would love to go back often and often.."
Chinese Pavilion,Akram Ul Haq,16 June 2016,5,Amazing food ! I always go here when I want Chinese food. My favourite being crab on toast ! You have to try it . The best place for authentic Chinese cuisine!
Chinese Pavilion,Krishna Teja Ratnakaram,15 June 2016,5,"I was never a fan of Chinese food until I visited Chinese pavilion(Banjara hills). When I heard that they've opened a second branch in gachibowli I couldn't wait to visit. However, they were successful in keeping up the quality, taste and my expectations. Great food, great ambience and very good service."
Chinese Pavilion,Sujay Garg,15 June 2016,5,"I visited this restaurant with friends and was immediately blown away with the quality of service.
We were seated immediately and the staff was courteous and professional especially with our large group.
The ambience is one of the best I've come across with a rather unusually quirky ceiling piece.
Food - I had the stuffed mushroom which was delicious along with a Fruit punch and a chocolate volcano.
All in all one of the best culinary experiences I've had in the city."
Chinese Pavilion,Richard Rao,14 June 2016,5,"Im going to cut to the chase, The food is excellent! 

I must say the honey Chicken and the Thai Chow Kay is by far the best. 
The Man Chow soup is another brilliant piece of art! 
For me this Chinese Pavilion beats any Chinese restaurant in the city.  

No wonder its called Chinese Pavilion! :D"
Chinese Pavilion,Shiladitya Chaudhury,05 June 2016,1.5,"Chinese Pavilion in Banjara HIlls was the first Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad for me and I still have fond memories of the great authentic taste. So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.
We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant. I am not sure what is the condition of their Banjara Hills branch now but there are far better Chinese eateries around Gchibowli as well."
Chinese Pavilion,Abhishek Mahajan,05 June 2016,3,"Madhumathi Mahajan Well to start with nice courteous servers and staff. Excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.

Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.

Last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.

Oh and I forgot, the orange pekoe tea, the best I had in lat few months. Have it"
Chinese Pavilion,Sharad Agrawal,04 June 2016,4.5,"This place has never disappointed us.. The food, the courteous staff, the serene ambience.. We wanted to have something totally rice free and with very little oil. They served us Steamed Fish with chilly garlic noodles with Chicken. As always it was awesome.. Thanks Chinese Pavilion, it is always a pleasant experience!"
Chinese Pavilion,Ramandeep,03 June 2016,1.5,"Bad rating is mainly because of ""Chicken Bone found in Veg food"" and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.

To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).

The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.

It was Thrusday special (Veg):
Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.
Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)
Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well made
Brocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried rice
Veg hakka noodles - was good
Veg fried rice

Overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.
Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.

Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.

Uploaded photos with the bone found."
Chinese Pavilion,Nayana Shanbhag,31 May 2016,4,"I personally love and prefer Chinese Food. Had been here couple of times with my husband.

The ambiance of the place is very good. The entrance has some carvings and the walls were very nicely decorated. The server was very polite

When it comes to food this place does not disappoint.This is a small/comfy restaurant that is surprisingly not very crowded even on weekends. 

We went there for our anniversary celebrations and it was just perfect. No crowd, we got the attention and service we were looking for."
Chinese Pavilion,Bhargava Krishna,31 May 2016,3.5,"Checked in here to try some delicious chinese food here, seen non-veg luncheon tray menu ans tried the same which they are charging 300+ taxes..
Started with manchow soup and liked it instantly.. Thereafter luncheon tray had came with pepper chicken starter, kimchi (salad), wolly chicken, egg fried rice and egg hakka noodles.. Taste is fine and didn't liked eating egg hakka noodles and egg fried rice at a time.. Badly missed dessert along with tray! (Dnt mind for extra price..)
Value for money and fine ambience."
